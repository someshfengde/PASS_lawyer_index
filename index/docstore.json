{"text": "FACTS\nthe price which the manufacturer of barlagan kotone, reported to the central government in 1971 was rs.24,735.68 per kg.\nafter the 1979 drugs (prices control. order came into force, the distinction between essential and non-essential bulk drugs was abolished and a maximum price had to be fixed for barlagan ketone also like other bulk drugs.\nthe manufacturer applied for fixation of price at rs.8,500 per kg.\narmed with authority under the drugs (prices control. order, 1979 the central government issued notifications fixing the maximum prices at which various indigenously manufactured bulk drugs may be sold by the manufacturers.\nthese notifications were questioned on several grounds by the manufacturers and they have been quashed by the delhi high court on the ground of failure to observe the principles of natural justice.\n\nARGUMENT\nshri g. ramaswamy, learned additional solicitor general on behalf of the union of india, submitted that the fixation of maximum price under paragraph 3 of the drugs (prices control. order was a legislative activity and, therefore, not subject to any principle of natural justice.\nhe urged that relevant information was required to be furnished and was indeed furnished by all the manufacturers in the prescribed form as required by paragraph 3(4) of the drugs (prices control) order.\nhe urged that the government had always been ready and wilting to give a proper hearing to the parties and in fact gave them a heating in connection with their review applications.\nthe learned counsel argued that there were several patent errors which came to light during the course of the hearing in the high court.\none of the submissions of shri diwan was that in calculating \"net-worth\" the cost of new works in progress and the amount invested outside the business were excluded from 'free reserves' and that such exclusion could not be justified on any known principle of accountancy.\nanother submission of the learned counsel relating to the norms for conversion costs, packing charges and process loss of raw materials and packing materials required to the notified for the purpose of calculating retail prices of formulations.\na general submission of the learned counsel was that the price of formulations should not have been prescribed until the review application filed by the manufacturer in regard to the patent bulk drugs was disposed of.\nhe submitted that the price of a formulation was dependant on the price of the bulk drug and it was, therefore, not right to fix the price of formulation when the price of bulk drug was in question in the review application and there was a prospect of the price of the bulk drug being increased.\n\nISSUE\nthe problem is that of high prices, bearing, it is said, little relation to the cost of production to the manufacturers.\n\nANALYSIS\n'price-fixation is neither the function nor the forte of the court.\nthe second observation made  is, legislative action, plenary or subordinate, is not subject to rules of natural justice.\nin the case of parliamentary legislation, the proposition is self-evident.\nin the case of subordinate 'legislation, it may happen that parliament may itself provide for a notice and for a hearing-there are several instances of the legislature requiring the subordinate legislating authority to give public notice and a public hearing before say, for example, levying a municipal rate--,in which case the substantial non-observance of the statutorily prescribed mode of observing natural justice may have the effect of invalidating the subordinate legislation.\nany attempt to draw a distinct line between legislative and administrative functions, it has been said, is 'difficult in theory and impossible in practice.\na price fixation measure does not concern itself with the interests of an individual manufacturer or producer.\nit is generally in relation to a particular commodity or class of commodities or transactions.\nit is a direction of a general character, not directed against a particular situation.\nit is intended to operate in the future. it is conceived in the interests of the general

making of a declaration that a certain place shall be a principal market yard for a market area under the relevant agricultural produce markets acts was an act legislative in character.\nthe observation of magarry, j. in bates v. lord hailsha, of st. marylebone [1972. 1 wlr 1973 that the rules of natural justice do not run in the sphere of legislation, primary or delegated, was cited with

land so acquired with the standing crop was taken possession of by the appellant.\nhe sold the crop to moti ram and kewal chand for rs. 2500 and facilitated the cutting and taking away of the crop by postponing the handing over of the possession to the contractor.\na chargesheet was filed against the appellant under section 5 (1) (c) and 5 (1) (d) read with 5 (2) of the prevention of corruption act on 5-8-1966 after obtaining sanction from the govt. of india, ministry of home affairs.\n\nARGUMENT\nthe learned advocate for the appellant has meticulously taken us through the entire documentary and oral evidence and commented at length upon the various contradictions and incongruities in the case of the prosecution with a view to establishing that when the appellant took possession of the land there was no crop standing on it-that tile possession of the land 'was in fact delivered to telu ram, contractor on 10-1-1963; that the said contractor had admitted 'that possession of the entire land was received by him; that he carried on the construction work in extending the aerodrome; that 200/250 donkeys were also used for doing the work by reason of which the crop was damaged before tehsildar had put the appellant in possession of the land and as a matter of fact there was no crop thereon when he got the possession of the land.\nit was also contended that the high court had not considered the contradictions in the earlier statement made by some of the witnesses to the military authorities and that it relied on many of the documents for affirming the conviction of the appellant without their actually being put to, him under section 342.\nit is further contended that the stand taken by the prosecution was that 'the persons who we're permitted to cut the crops bad' not committed any offence.\n\nISSUE\nwhether the facts were sufficient to sustain the sanction under 5(1)(c) even if the charge under 5(1)(d) had failed. this question in turnwill depend upon what are the ingredients of the offences under 5(1)(c) and (d) read with section 5(2).\nthere was utter confusion in respect of the date on which possession of the acquired land was given to the appellant and the date on which it was given to the contractor for carrying on the work, as also in respect of the fact whether there was any crop standing when the appellant took possession of the land and at what period of time the crop was cut and the work commenced.\n\nANALYSIS\nthough it is desirable that the facts should be referred to in the sanction itself, nonetheless if they do not appear on the face of it, the prosecution must establish aliunde by evidence that those facts were placed before the sanctioning authorities.\nit is therefore necessary to first examine the order of sanction to ascertain on what facts it has", "doc_id": "cab1ef2d-427c-4499-be62-ea53c4166306", "embedding": null, "doc_hash": "cb708f2802120b1b66d6b271f3dedd1ab72b72fa7ed8fbbded1866653fa98548", "extra_info":

lease creates right or an interest in enjoyment of the demised property and a tenant or a sub-tenant is entitled to remain in possession of the demised property until the lease is duly terminated and eviction takes place in accordance with law. therefore,a tenant or a sub-tenant in possession of a tenement in the town planning scheme is a person interested within the meaning of rules 21(3) and (4)

regarding the incident at the video parlour is cogent and trustworthy and nothing has been brought out during the cross-examination of these witnesses which may cast any doubt about the correctness of the version given by them regarding the incident at the video parlour.\nthe designated court rightly found the participation of a-1,a-5,a-8,a-9 and a-11,in the assault,to have been positively established. however,so far as a-10 is concerned, there is merit in the submissions of the learned counsel for the appellant that his identify and participation in the assault has not been established

day, by a medical board of three doctors.\nit was found that the victim was brutally ravished and thereafter killed.\naccording to the medical opinion the probable cause of death of s was shock

deceased.\nthe clothes of the accussed recovered were sent to forensic science laboratory. according to report human semen was detected on underwear and human blood of group 'b' was detected on the underwear.\n\nARGUMENT\nthe learned counsel for the accused-appellant has placed reliance on shankarlal gyarasilal dixit v. state of maharashtra, air (1981. sc 765 1980 indlaw sc 47.\ntherein a charge under sections 376 and 302  ipc  was sought to be substantiated on circumstanctial evidence.\none of the circumstan-tial evidence relied on was that a human blood stain of 'b' group was found on the

appellant raped or murdered the victim. b' group is not uncommon group of blood and no effort was made to exclude the possibility that the blood of the accused belonged to the same group.\nas regards the dried stain of semen on the appellant's under-pant, the court observed that the accused was a grown-up man of 30 years and no compelling inference could arise that the stain was caused during the course of the sexual assault committed by him on the victim girl.\nin the present case the age of the accused was about 21 years at the time of the incident.\non his arrest he was subjected to medical examination and found to be a potent and capable person.\npresence of semen stain on underwear, assuming that the underwear belonged to the accused though there is no evidence adduced in this regard, is not by itself an incriminating piece of evidence connecting the accused with the crime in question.\nso also the discov-ery of 'b' group blood-stain on the underwear cannot be treated as an

section 313 cr. p.c. and nowhere suggested during cross-examination of prosecution witnesses that at the time of the incident he was at a place wherefrom he could not have reached the place of the

{"text": "FACTS\nthree civil appeals, stemming from three revision petitions to the high court of orissa under the orissa estates abolition act, 1951.\nthe high court, after deciding various issues, remanded the cases to the compensation officer under the act, after over-ruling most of the contentions pressed before it by the appellant.\nshri achutananda purohit, appellant, was the intermediary in respect of vast forests and other lands comprised in the estate of jujumura in the district of sambalpur.\nthe appellant has received around rs. 3,00,000/- but much more, according to him, is due.\n\nARGUMENT\nthe argument is that for certain reasons the appellant could not derive actual income from the forests taken over by the state from him and therefore there was no income-tax payable on any agricultural income from these forests.\nthe contention is that therefore in arriving at the next income the deduction of income-tax is not permissible.\n\nISSUE\nthe estate vested in the state on april 1, 1960 by force of the act and the crucial question consequentially turns on the quantum of compensation awardable under chapter v of the orissa estates abolition act, 1951.\nthe meat of the matter, the primary question agitated in the appeal, lopping off the fringe issues of lesser import, consists in the statutory methodology and functionaries prescribed by the act for quantifying the compensation and the compliance therewith by the statutory machinery in the case of the appellant.\n\nANALYSIS\nthe compensation officer is charged with fixing the quantum in the prescribed manner.\na compensation assessment roll containing the gross asset and net income of each estate, together with the compensation payable in respect of such estate, has to be prepared by him.\nthe dynamic rule of law, with a social mission, makes a meaningful distinction between rights steeped in the old system and compensation for deprivation of those interests, on the one hand, and the ordinary commercial transactions or regulation of rights untinged by social transformation urges, on the other.\nthis gives rationality to the seeming disparity.\nmoreover, the high court has rightly pointed out that the validity of s. 37(3) of the act which fixes a small rate of interest on the compensation amount has been upheld by the supreme court in gajapati narayan's case.\nfor the purposes of the law, the rupee of long ago is the same as the rupee of today, although for the purposes of the market place and cost-of living, the housewife's answer may be different.\nart. 31(3) read with art. 31(2) bars any challenge to the amount of compensation on acquisition by the state subject to compliance with the prescriptions in the said sub-articles, on the ground that the amount so fixed or determined is not adequate.\npresidential assent has been accorded to this state act and so the ban operates.\nmoreover, art. 31a repels the applicability of arts. 14, 19 and 31 to the acquisition by the state of any estate or of any rights therein etc.\nin the case of forests it is the assumed income and not the actual income that forms the basis of calculation of compensation.\non the other hand, statutory compensation is provided for on the formula of assumed income in the previous year.\nsimilarly, an assumed income- tax also has to be worked out and deducted.\nthe statutory scheme of compensation for forest lands consists of machinery for assessment of the net income which is multiplied on a sliding scale and the method of challenge to the determination by the aggrieved owner of state.\nso the first step is for the government to appoint forest officers from out of d.f.os. in the forest department, for the purposes of the act.\nthose officers ascertain the income from the forest concerned and the figure so fixed is subject to the approval of the c.c.f. (chief conservator of forests).\nthe power to approve implies the power to disapprove or modify but not to report or arrive at an income de hors the forest officer's report altogether.\nindeed, there

astonishing that anyone should urge, as the appellant did, that the date of vesting is the last date by which the calculation of compensation should have been made and since that had not been done, the compensation officer had become functus officio in awarding compensation.\nin this context, it is perhaps not irrelevant to remember that the appellant, a freedom-fighter, is an 83-year-old man and, at this stage of his life, the state should show \u0000ommiseration not merely in quickly disposing of the proceedings but also in not being cantankerous in awarding and disbursing the balance

therein.\ns. 26 has great relevance as it lays down the method of arriving at the gross asset and s. 27 has like significance as it focuses on the manner in which the net income from an estate shall be computed by deducting certain items from the gross asset of the estate.\ns. 28 states how the amount of compensation is to be determined and the methodology of payment.\nthere are a few other s.s

board constituted under s. 22.\nthe rule-making power is vested in the government under s. 47 and there is a routine 'removal of difficulties' clause contained in s. 50.\nthe policy of the law of agrarian reform postulates the extinguishment of ancient privileges and cornering of land resources, and the socioeconomic yardstick is different from what applies to ordinary purchases of real estate

he urged are briefly these:\n(1) that there was a misjoinder of charges and persons in that the various provisions of s. 239 were clubbed together and an omnibus charge of conspiracy was framed which on its face was one likely to embarrass the respondents and make their task of defending themselves difficult.\n(2) the procedure adopted in the investigation and committal stages was irregular.\n(3) irrelevant evidence was introduced and some evidence was introduced in a manner not authorised by the evidence act.\n(4) that the court abused its powers under s.342, cr. p.c. while conducting the examination of the respondents.\n(5) the evidence of the approver was inadmissible because the pardon granted to him was illegal, that, in any case, it is unreliable, was so found even by the sessions judge and must, therefore, be rejected.\nif the evidence of the approver is left out the remaining evidence would be inadequate to sustain the prosecution case.\nas many as 2, 000 documents were \"dumped\" by the prosecution in this case out of which 1600 documents were not sought to be proved by it.\nfurther, 64 documents were missing from the records when they came to the high court and that this has caused serious prejudice to the respondent.\n\nISSUE\nwhether there was a misjoinder of parties and of persons.\n\nANALYSIS\ns. 120 b provides that whoever is a party to a criminal conspiracy to commit an offence punishable with death, imprisonment for life or rigorous imprisonment for a term of two years or upwards shall be punishable in the same manner as if he has abetted such offence unless there was an express provision in the code for the punishment of such conspiracy.\nthe first charge is in respect of the conspiracy alleged to have been entered into by the two respondents, k. v. ramana, the approver, and others \"known and unknown\" to commit criminal breach of trust of the funds of vesco and, in order to screen its detection, to falsify the accounts of vesco and to use forged documents as genuine.\non the face of it this is a valid charge.\nbut certain objections have been taken to it with which the court will deal at the appropriate place.\nthe second charge is for an offence of criminal breach of trust punishable under s. 409 and the accusation therein is that the two respondents along with ramana, misappropriated 69 items aggregating to a little over rs. 3, 20, 000/-.\nit is clear from the charge that some of the amounts were misappropriated between april, 1947 and march, 1950, some between april, 1947 and march, 1949, some between april, 1947 and march, 1951 and quite a large number between september, 1947 and march, 1950 and a still large number between april, 1951 and march, 1952.\nit is thus apparent that offences committed within a space of 12 months were tried along with offences committed beyond that period.\nunless, therefore, the provisions of s. 239 are applicable it would follow that there was a misjoinder of charges.\nthe third charge is that the two respondents, along with the approver ramana made false entries on seven different dates in the account books between september 19, 1947 and march 18, 1952 and thus committed an offence under s. 477-a, i.p.c.\nthe fourth charge is that the two respondents, along with the approver ramana forged six documents on different dates between march 28, 1949 and november 12, 1951 and thus committed an offence under s. 471 read with s. 467, i.p.c.\nthere the learned judges have held that these clauses are mutually exclusive and they cannot be simultaneously

(c) of s. 239 is subject to the provisions of s. 234.\nin the court\u2019s opinion the words \"within the meaning of s. 234\" indicate that what was meant by the words offence of the same kind\" \"'persons accused of more offences than one of the same kind not exceeding three in number\"or may have used the words\" person accused of more than one offence of the same kind to the extent permissible under s. 234.\ntherefore, even if the expression \"'same transaction\" alone had been used in s. 235(1) it would have meant a transaction consisting either of a single act or of a series of connected acts.\nthe expression \"same transaction\" occurring in cls. (a), (c) and (d) of s. 239 as well as that occurring in s. 235(1) ought to be given the same meaning according to the normal rule of construction of statutes.\nlooking at the matter in that way, it is pointless to inquire further whether the provisions of s. 239 are subject to those of s. 236(1).\nthe provisions of sub-s.

clear that the sections preceding s. 239 have no overriding effect on that section, , the courts are not to ignore them but apply such of them as can be applied without detracting from the provisions

illegal means.\ncriminal conspiracy was, however, not an unknown thing before the amendment of the indian penal code in 1913.\nbut what the amendment did was to make that conspiracy itself punishable. the idea was to prevent the commission of crimes by, so to , speak, nipping them in the bud.\nbut it does not follow that where crimes have been committed the liability to punishment already incurred under s. 120-b by having entered into a criminal conspiracy is thereby wiped away.\nno doubt, as already stated, where offences for committing which a conspiracy was entered into have actually been committed it may not, in the particular circumstances of a case, be desirable to charge the offender both with the conspiracy and the offences committed in pursuance of that conspiracy.\nbut that would be a matter ultimately within the discretion of the court before which the trial takes place.\nin so far as the fourth point is concerned, that would have a bearing not on the form of the charge but on the credibility of the evidence bearing on the point of conspiracy.\nthe prosecution be established by reference to s. 34 of the indian evidence act which reads thus as what it does is to make entries in books of account regularly kept in the course of business relevant in all proceedings in a court of law.\nthese entries are, however, not by themselves sufficient to charge any person with liability.\ntherefore, when a sues b for a sum of money it is open to him to put his account books' in evidence provided they are regularly kept in the course of business and show by reference to them

consideration for the purpose of determining whether the amount referred to therein was in fact paid by a to b.\nthe entry by itself is of no help to a in his claim against b but it can be considered

hearing has observed that no inference can be drawn from the absence of any entry relating to any particular matter which observation supports the view taken in queen empress v. girish chander banerjee ( (1884) i.l.r. 10 c.l 1024. ).\nthere is s. ii of the evidence act which provides that facts not otherwise relevant are relevant if they are inconsistent with any fact in issue or relevant fact.\nsome of the facts in issue in this case are whether payments of certain sums of money were made to crompton engineering co., and other firms or authorities.\nabsence of entries in their account books would be inconsistent with the receipt of the accounts and would thus be a relevant fact which can be proved under s. 11.\nthe fact that no payments were received by those firms has been deposed to by persons connected with those firms and whose duty it was to receive and acknowledge amounts received by the firms or who were in charge of the accounts of these firms.\nfor the purpose of showing that no amounts were received by the firms, their account books would thus be as relevant as the vesco account books for the purpose of showing the contrary.\nthere is s. 5 of the evidence act which reads thus as it is the case of the prosecution that the alleged payments were never made by vesco to the various firms.\nthe offence under s. 467 read with s. 471 is punishable with imprisonment for life or imprisonment of either description for a period of 10 years but it is exclusively triable by a court of session .\nas regards the offence under s. 477-a, it is one of those sections which are specifically enumerated in s. 337 (1) and the argument advanced before the court and which the court rejected would not even be available with regard to the pardon in respect of that offence.\nit is true that the respondent no. i alone was convicted by the additional sessions judge of this offence and the offence under s. 467 read with s. 471 but the validity of a pardon is to be determined with reference to the offence alleged against the approver alone and not with reference to the offence or offences for which his associates were ultimately convicted.\nthe decision in sarwan singh v. the state of punjab ([1957] b. c. r. 953.), on which reliance has been placed by the high court has been explained by this court in the case of maj. e. g. barsay v. the state of bombay .\nthis court has pointed out in the latter decision that while it must be shown that the approver is a witness of truth, the evidence adduced in a case cannot be considered in compartments and that even for judging the credibility of, the approver the evidence led to corroborate him in material particulars would be relevant for consideration.\nthe high court should bear this in mind for deciding whether the evidence of the approver should be acted upon or not.\nthen again it would not be sufficient for the high court to deal with the evidence in a general way.\nit would be necessary for it to consider for itself the evidence adduced by the prosecution on the specific charges and then to conclude whether those charges have been established or not.\nthe prosecution would be well, advised if, instead of placing the evidence on each and every one of those large number of charges against the respondents, it chooses to select a few charges under each head other than the head of conspiracy and concentrates on establishing those charges, this would save public time and also serve the purpose of the prosecution.\nthe court set aside the acquittal of the respondents and remit the appeal to the

that it is an enabling provision and, therefore, the court has a discretion to avail itself cumulatively of two or more clauses.\nthe concluding portion of s. 239 shows that the provisions contained in the former part of chapter xix shall, as far as may be, apply to the charges framed with the aid of s. 239.\ndoes this mean that the provisions of s. 233, 234, 235, and 236 must also be complied with?\nobviously, s. 233 does not override the provisions of s. 239. s. 234 cannot also be regarded as an overriding provision because reading it that way will lead to the clear result that whereas several accused persons can be charged at the same trial with any number of different offences committed by them in the course of the same transaction they cannot be tried also for -offences of the same kind exceeding three in number and committed beyond a space of 12 months from the first to the last.\nit could not have been the intention of the legislature to create such a situation.\nagain,

evidence under section 27 of the evidence act,but admissibility alone would not render the evidence,pertaining to the above information,reliable.\nwhile testing the reliability of such evidence the court has to see whether it was voluntarily stated by the accused.\nthe alleged statement made by the accused led to discovery of knife,bloodstained clothes,rope,etc.\nunfortunately,for the prosecution there is no evidence to show that in fact the wearing apparels containing bloodstains belonged to the accused,save and except the alleged confessional statement.\nno witness has spoken that those clothes were worn by the accused at any time far less at or about the time of occurrence.\nit is also to be kept in view that those articles were recovered from the house of p.w.3 and at the initial stage of investigation,p.w.3 himself was one of the suspected person and he was arrested.\ntherefore,the statement of p.w.3 and his mother that those articles were brought by the accused and left in the upstairs room is to be considered with a pinch of salt\nmoreover,there is nothing to indicate that in fact the bloodstained clothes and rope had tallied with the blood grouping of the deceased.\nthe knife did not contain any bloodstain.\ntherefore,the aspect relating to recovery of articles from the house of p.w.3 and his mother cannot be considered as a link to complete the chain of circumstantial evidence.\nthe evidence of p.ws.17,18 and 19 is relevant.\nsince the golden jewellery had been molten and were recovered in the shape of ingots,it would be very hazardous to come to the conclusion that in fact the golden jewellery belonged to the deceased.\nif the accused had killed the deceased and stolen those golden jewellery,there is no reason as to why he had also not taken ear rings from the deceased.\nthe fact that ear rings were on the dead body is admitted by the prosecution.\nthe fact that there had been a statement allegedly made by p.w.1 leading to recovery of a parallel key from the dash board of the car of p.w.1,cannot be lost sight of.\nfinal however,the very suspicious role of p.w.40,who apparently was in possession of at least two keys of the same lock creates suspicion regarding recovery of another key after 5 months.\nlaw is well settled that when the prosecution relies upon circumstantial evidence,all the links in the chain of circumstances must be complete and should be proved through cogent evidence\nwhen the judgment of the high court is analysed in the background of what has been stated by this court as regards circumstantial evidence,the inevitable conclusion is that the impugned judgment of the high court does not suffer from any infirmity to warrant interference.\n\nSTATUTE\nsection 302 ipc, 1860.\n\n", "doc_id":

benefit of leave.\n\nARGUMENT\ndr. rajiv dhawan, learned senior counsel, appearing on behalf of the appellants in civil appeal no.337 of 2002 and mr. m.n. rao, learned senior counsel, appearing on behalf of the appellants in civil appeal no.335 of 2002, took us through materials on records and contended that the appellants herein became 'permanent employees' of the respondents having regard to the provisions contained in s. 2 of the 1961 act and order 2(i) and 2(vi) of the standard standing orders as set out in the annexure appended to the 1963 rules defining 'permanent employees' and the 'temporary employees.\nthe learned counsel would urge that a seniority list was also drawn up and an employment code was assigned to each one of the appellants from which fact the nature of their employment should be judged.\n\nISSUE\na dispute arose as to whether all the appellants were employed for the purpose of the said project or the appellants in civil appeal no.337 of 2002 were appointed in the year 1991 by the authority for its own job.\nwhether non-regularisation of the sub-engineers (as per the listed enclosed) is valid and proper. if no, then to which relief they are entitled and what directions should be given to the employer.\nwhether it is valid and proper for not giving equal salary to these sub engineers like other sub engineers in accordance with the equal work.\nthe question, which arises for consideration is as to whether they could lay a valid claim for regularization of their services.\n\nANALYSIS\nan industrial dispute was raised by the appellants herein as their services were not being regularized by the respondent.\nthe respondent-authority is a state within the meaning of art. 12 of the constitution of india.\nit is, therefore, constitutionally obliged to strictly comply with the requirements of arts. 14 and 16 thereof before making any appointment.\nindisputably, the conditions precedent for appointment of the officers and servants of the authority, as contained in the service rules had not been complied with.\nthe appointments of the appellants were, therefore, void ab initio being opposed to public policy as also violative of arts. 14 and 16 of the constitution of india.\na state before offering public service to a person must comply with the constitutional requirements of arts. 14 and 16 of the

justification to avoid or evade the transfer order merely on the ground of having made a representation,or on the ground of his difficulty in moving from one place to the other.\nif he fails to proceed on transfer in compliance to the transfer order,he would expose himself to disciplinary action under the relevant rules,as has happened in the instant case.\nthe respondent lost his service as

leave is directed against the judgment and order of the labour appellate tribunal of india in a dispute regarding the workers' claim for bonus.\nduring the year 1948 the appellant made a profit of rs. 11,97,648-11-9.\nit paid 24 3 per cent. dividend on ordinary shares, being the maximum that could be paid under the public companies (limitation of dividend) ordinance of 1948 and also paid to the workers their full share of bonus at annas 4 in a rupee of their basic earnings.\nduring the year 1949 the selling rates for cloth and yarn were controlled by the government and were approximately 4 per cent. below those obtained in 1948.\nthe basic wages were increased from the 1st december, 1948, by order of the government of uttar pradesh and the total wages paid were therefore higher than those in the previous year.\nthere was moreover indiscipline amongst the workers and production suffered.\nthere was a strike in the month of october and the mills were closed for nearly a month.\nfurther the management were unable to secure cotton which resulted in the curtailment of the working hours.\nas a result of all these circumstances the appellant suffered a huge trading loss.\nthe appellant also paid ex gratia to the workmen bonus at the rate of annas 2 per rupee of their basic earnings making it clear by their notification dated the 7th april, 1950, that the directors had sanctioned the payment at that rate in spite of the appellant having suffered a trading loss for the year, that it was being paid entirely at the discretion of the appellant and was not related to or connected with any contract of employment of any worker.\nthe secretary of the respondent union petitioned to the provincial conciliation officer (textile) that there was more production in 1949 than in 1948, that there was no reason to hold that the profit in 1949 was less than in the previous year and that the rate of bonus was wrongly reduced and asked that bonus for 1949 should also be paid at the rate of annas 4 per rupee.\nthe industrial dispute which thus arose was referred for enquiry and recording of an award to the regional conciliation board (textile), kanpur.\nthe conciliation board by a majority decision repelled the contention of the appellant and awarded the payment of bonus at annas 4 per rupee.\non an appeal taken by the appellant to the industrial court (textiles and hosiery), kanpur, the industrial court accepted the contention of the appellant, allowed the appeal and set aside the award.\nthe respondent thereupon appealed to the labour appellate tribunal which substantially agreed with the industrial court on questions of fact as well as the general position in law but imported considerations of social justice and treating this as a special case \" where social justice would demand that labour should have bonus for the year where for that very year capital had not only a reasonable return but much in excess of that \", allowed the appeal and directed the appellant to pay to the workmen bonus at the rate of annas 4 per rupee within six weeks of their decision.\nthe appellant filed this appeal against that decision after obtaining special leave from this court.\n\nARGUMENT\nthe learned counsel for the respondent. attempted to give a definition in the following terms : \"social justice connotes the balance of adjustments of the various interests concerned in the social and economic structure of the state, in order to promote harmony upon an ethical and economic basis\" and he stated that there were three parties concerned here, viz. the employers, the labour and the state itself, and the conception of social justice had to be worked out in this context.\nwithout embarking upon a discussion as to the exact connotation of the expression \"social justice\" we may only observe that the concept of social justice does not emanate from the fanciful notions of any particular adjudicator but must be founded on a more solid

{"text": "entitled to the payment of a bonus in spite of the employer having worked at a loss during the year and incidentally whether the workers have any right, title or interest in the reserves and the undistributed profits of the previous years.\n\nANALYSIS\nthe primary meaning of the word \" bonus \" imports the conception of a boon, a gift or a gratuity otherwise described as an ex gratia payment.\nthe word 'bonus' has however acquired a secondary meaning in the sphere of industrial relations. it is classified amongst the methods of wage payment.\nin sutton v. attorney-general , (1923) 39 t.l.r. 294, 297; where \"the term 'bonus' may of course be properly used to describe payments made of grace and not as of right.\nbut it nevertheless may also include, as here, payments made because legally due but which the parties contemplate will not continue indefinitely\"\nthere are however two conditions which have to be satisfied before a demand for bonus can be justified and they are, (1) when wages fall short of the living standard and (2) the industry makes huge profits part of which are due to the contribution which the workmen make in increasing production.\nthe demand for bonus becomes an industrial claim when either or both these conditions are satisfied.\nthe surplus that remained after meeting the aforesaid deductions would be available for distribution as bonus.\nit is therefore clear that the claim for bonus can be made by the employees only if as a result of the joint contribution of capital and labour the industrial concern has earned profits.\nif in any particular year the working of the industrial concern has resulted in loss there is no basis nor justification for a demand for bonus.\nthe dividends can only be paid out of profits and unless and until profits are made no occasion or question can also arise for distribution of any sum as bonus amongst the employees.\nthis has been clearly recognised even in the various decisions of the labour appellate tribunal, e.g., nizam sugar factory ltd., hyderabad v. their workmen, (1952) i l.l.j. 386; textile mills, madhya pradesh v. their workmen, (1952) 2 l.l.j. 625;and famous cine laboratory v. their workmen, (1953) i l.l.j. 466;\nthis was also the basis of the demand of the respondent in the case before us, its case being that the appellant had reaped substantial profits during the year 1949.\non the accounts of each year being made up and the profits of the industrial concern being ascertained the workers during the particular year have their demand for bonus fully satisfied out of the surplus profits and the balance of profits is allocated and carried over in the accounts.\nno further claimed payment of bonus out of those reserves or undistributed profits can therefore survive.\nit is also significant to note that even while importing considerations of social justice the labour appellate tribunal was oblivious of the fact that it was by their own acts of indiscipline and strike that the workers of the appellant company themselves contributed, to the trading losses incurred by the appellant and it hardly lay in their mouth then to contend that they were none the less entitled to a payment of bonus commensurate with the dividend paid to the shareholders out of the undistributed profits of the previous years.\nthe labour appellate tribunal also overlooked the fact that but for the public companies (limitation of dividend) ordinance of 1948 the whole of the profits of 1948 could have been distributed after paying the workers bonus in that year of four annas in the rupee.\n\n", "doc_id": "6b396f90-6381-4019-bdf9-415ceac2d4cd", "embedding": null, "doc_hash": "c4a3f84399c17e92db932c03e97827e686845aee16d55c523e87949aa513e0d7",

position,let us consider whether the request of the learned senior counsel for the appellant is to be accepted and sentence be reduced to the period already undergone.\ninasmuch as the incident had occurred on 14.11.1997 and the trial court has convicted him on 19.03.2001 which was affirmed by the high court on 03.10.2007,at this juncture,i.e.,after a gap of 14 years,there is no need to retain the same sentence and the court is not justified in directing the appellant to serve the remaining period after such a long time.\nby drawing our attention to art.142 of the constitution of india,learned senior counsel for the appellant vehemently submitted that in order to do complete justice,this court has ample power to reduce the sentence even to the extent of period already undergone or any other order which would be beneficial to the parties approaching this court.\n\nISSUE\nnotice only on quantum of sentence-hearing on all aspects-permissibility.\nquantum of sentence-whether requires any reduction.\n\nANALYSIS\nthere is no dispute as regards the date of occurrence and the date of conviction passed by the trial court and affirmed by the high court.\ninasmuch as the conviction on both counts have been confirmed by this court and we are confined to sentence part alone and in view of the minimum sentence prescribed u/ss.7 and 13 of the act,we are of the view that though long delay may be a ground for reduction of sentence in other cases,the same may not be applicable to the case on hand when the statute prescribes minimum sentence.\nabout the request based on delay that the appellant has lost his job,undergone the ordeal all along etc.\na lenient view be taken in this case,it is useful to refer decision of this court

exercised to negate the statutory provisions.\nin academy of nutrition improvement and others vs.union of india,jt 2011 (8) sc 16 2011 indlaw sc 515,the following conclusion about the applicability of art.142 is relevant: the question is having held that rule 44i to be invalid,whether we can permit the continuation of the ban on sale of non-iodised salt for human consumption for any period.art.142 of the constitution vests unfettered independent jurisdiction to pass any order in public interest to do complete justice,if exercise of such jurisdiction is not be contrary to any express provision of law.\nthough the jurisdiction of this court,u/art.142 of the constitution of india is not in dispute,we make it clear that exercise of such power would,however,depend on the facts and circumstances of each case.\nthe high court,in exercise of its jurisdiction,u/s.482 of the criminal procedure code and this court,u/art.142 of the constitution,would not ordinarily direct quashing of a case involving crime against the society particularly,when both the trial court as also the high court have found that the charge leveled against the appellant under the act has been made out and proved by the prosecution by placing acceptable evidence.\nthe orders do not disclose any factual details and the relevant provisions under which the accused was charged/convicted and minimum sentence,if any,as available in the act as well as the period already undergone.\nfrom the analysis of the above decisions and the concerned provisions with which is concerned,the following principles emerge:\na) when the court issues notice confining to particular aspect/sentence,arguments will be heard only to that extent unless some extraordinary circumstance/material is shown to the court for arguing the matter on all aspects.\nb) long delay in disposal of appeal or any other factor may not be a ground for reduction of sentence,particularly,when the statute prescribes minimum sentence.in other cases where no such minimum sentence is prescribed,it is open to the court to consider the delay and its effect and the ultimate decision. c) in a case of corruption by public servant,quantum of amount is immaterial.ultimately it depends upon the conduct of the delinquent and the proof regarding demand and acceptance established by the prosecution.\nd) merely because the delinquent lost his job due to conviction under the act may not be a mitigating circumstance for reduction of sentence,particularly,when the statute prescribes minimum sentence.\ne) though art.142 of the constitution gives wider power to this court,waiver of certain period as prescribed in the statute imposing lesser sentence than the minimum prescribed is not permissible.\nf) an order,which this court can make in order to do complete justice between the parties,must not only be consistent with the fundamental rights guaranteed by the constitution,but also it cannot even be inconsistent with the substantive provisions of the relevant statute.\ng) in exercise of the power u/art.142 of the constitution,this court generally does not pass an order in contravention of or ignoring the statutory provisions nor is the power exercised merely on sympathy.\nh) the power u/art.142 of the constitution is a constitutional power and not restricted by statutory enactments.\nhowever,this court would not pass any order u/art.142

company incorporated under the companies act,1956 with the object of manufacture and sale of cigarettes.\nmembers of general public are the shareholders and the shares of the company are traded in through various stock exchanges in the country.\na petition was filed under article 226 of the constitution by respondent no.1 seeking for a writ of mandamus to treat the members of the respondent-union who are employees working in the canteen of the appellants factory as employees of the appellant and for grant of monetary and other consequential benefits.\nthe learned single judge granted reliefs sought for by the respondents,however,imposing certain restrictions with regard to the age,being medically fit,on the date of the writ petition,had put in a minimum of three years of continuous service and such service prior to the attainment of the minimum qualifying age under the company should be ignored\n. on appeal,the division bench of the high court affirmed the view taken by the learned single judge.\n\nARGUMENT\non behalf of the respondents,it is contended that the appellant had been managing the canteen up to the year 1982 and thereafter introduced the contract system for maintaining the canteen so established; that though the management of the canteen had been entrusted to the contractors from time to time,the personnel employed in the canteen were retained by all the contractors and they have been paid salaries through contractors; that the workmen employed in the canteen have been provided with esi benefits under the code no.vst,the appellant,and benefits arising under the employees provident funds act are also provided similarly; that the appellant has also provided a building along with furniture,utensils,cutlery,gas,electricity,water supply and other facilities; that the contractor is engaged only to prepare the food and serve it to the employees and that the quality of the food and the rates are controlled by the management of the appellant.\non behalf of the appellant,contention was raised that no writ would lie against the appellant inasmuch as the appellant is a company,which is not an authority or a person against whom a writ would lie.\nit was submitted that they do not discharge any public duty and hence the writ cannot be issued. on the merits of the matter,the appellant disputed various questions of fact and urged that the decision of this court in parimal chandra raha vs. life insurance corporation of india,1995 supp.(2) scc 611 1995 indlaw sc 183,would not be applicable to the appellant in the facts and circumstances of the case.\non behalf of the appellant contention put forth at the forefront is that a writ would not lie against the appellant inasmuch as the appellant is engaged in the manufacture and sale of cigarettes and as an incident thereto has provided a canteen to its workmen pursuant to an obligation under section 46 of the act.\non behalf of the respondent,heavy reliance was placed on this decision and also the decision of the high court in t.gattaiahs case,to contend that in running a canteen under section 46 of the act,the appellant was discharging a public duty and,therefore,a writ of mandamus would lie against it.\nthe contesting respondents contended that the workmen in the canteen had been working right from its inception,that is,since 1967; that from 1976 onwards,after expiry of the contract with the industrial catering services,they had been directly working with the appellant without any contractor; that they sought for regularization of their services by letter dated 28 february 1978; that the said letter was corrected and redrafted by the personnel manager to indicate the idea of floating an association/society to run the canteen; that this modified request

jowells judicial review of administrative action,5th edn.,after detailed discussion,the learned authors have summarized the position with the following propositions:\n(1) the test of whether a body is performing a public function,and is hence amenable to judicial review,may not depend upon the source of its power or whether the body is ostensibly a public or a private body.\n2) the principles of judicial review prima facie govern the activities of bodies performing public functions.\nhowever,not all decisions taken by bodies in the course of their public functions are the subject matter of judicial review.\nin the following two situations judicial review will not normally be appropriate even though the body may be performing a public function:\n(a) where some other branch of the law more appropriately governs the dispute between the parties.\nin such a case,that branch of the law and its remedies should and normally will be applied;\nand (b) where there is a contract between the litigants. in such a case the express or implied terms of the agreement should normally govern the matter.\nthus,where a special method of resolving disputes (such as arbitration or resolution by private or domestic tribunals) has been agreed by the parties (expressly or by necessary implication),that regime,and not judicial review,will normally govern the dispute.\nthe high court has relied very strongly on the decision of a learned single judge in t.gattaiahs case wherein it was stated that a writ may lie under article 226 of the constitution against a company incorporated under the companies act,1956 as it is permissible to issue a writ against any person.\nin anadi muktas case this court examined the various aspects and the distinction between an authority and a person and after analysis of the decisions referred in that regard came to the conclusion that it is only in the circumstances when the authority or the person performs a public function or discharges a public duty article 226 of the constitution can be invoked.\nin the present case,the appellant is engaged in the manufacture and sale of cigarettes.\nmanufacture and sale of cigarettes will not involve any public function.\nincidental to that activity there is an obligation under section 46 of the act to set up a canteen when the establishment has more than 250 workmen.\nthat means,it is a condition of service in relation to a workman providing better facilities to workmen to discharge their duties properly and maintain their own health or welfare.\nthe findings recorded by the learned single judge on examination of the facts available is that there had been a canteen within the premises of the appellant up to the year 1982 and it is only from 1982 onwards the management of the canteen has been entrusted to a private contractor; that even after change of the contractor,the canteen workers have continued to be the same irrespective of the change in the contractors from time to time; that wages were paid to the workmen in the canteen by the management through the contractor; that the appellant has provided the accommodation,furniture,fuel,electricity,utensils,etc. that the management exercises control over the standard in quality,quantity and the rate of the food items supplied to the workmen for whose benefit the canteen is established.\nthus,these circumstances clearly indicate that the appellant has a complete control over the activities in respect of the canteen and the contractor has absolutely no discretion either in regard to the menu,quality and quantity of the food items much less the rate at which the same are supplied to the workmen.\nwhen the management of the appellant exercises such a complete control,the canteen shall be deemed to be run by the management itself.\nthe appellant in any manner cannot controvert these facts.\nthere is no material on record to show that the canteen is located in such an area where it would be hazardous to have a

will.\nprobate of the will of dwarka nath was also obtained by jogendra on the 31st august, 1909.\nbhupendra, jnanendra. and nagendra, then a minor, the three sons of rajendra filed a suit, on the high court at calcutta against jogendra, golap sundari and some others for the construction of the wills of dwarka nath and rajendra, for partition and other reliefs.\nthe said suit was compromised and on the 24th november, 1910, a consent decree was passed, whereby jogendra and golap sundari gave up their rights to the sevayatship and bhupendra, jnanendra and nagendra became the sevaits of the idol, a portion of the premises no. 41 grey street was allotted to the branch of rajendra and the remaining portion was allotted to jogendra.\ndisputes arose between bhupendra, jnanendra and nagendra, the sons of rajendra, and one kedar nath was appointed arbitrator to settle those disputes.\nthe arbitrator made his award whereby he allotted premises no. 41-a grey street, exclusively to nagendra as his share of the family properties.\nnagendra thereafter executed several mortgages of the said premises.\nnagendra executed a deed of settlement of the said premises by which he appointed his wife and his wife's brother as trustees to carry out the directions therein contained and in pursuance of the deed of settlement he gave up possession of the said premises in favour of the trustees.\nsnehalata dutt filed in the year 1929 a suit, against nagendra, the trustees under the said deed of settlement and the puisne mortgagees, for realisation of the mortgage security.\nthe said premises were ultimately put up for sale in execution of the mortgage decree and were purchased on the 9th december, 1936, by hari charan dutt, hari pada dutt and durga charan dutt.\non the 19th july, 1948, the family idol of dwarka nath, sree sree iswar sridhar jew, by its next friend debabrata ghosh, the son of nagendra, filed the suit, out of which the present appeal arises.\n\nARGUMENT\nthe only thing which was urged by shri n. c. chatterjee in support of his contention was that the right to reside in the premises was given to the sevayats and that according to him detracted from the

partial.\nwhat we find here in cl. 3 of the will is an absolute dedication of the premises no. 41 grey street to the idol as its permanent habitation with only the right given to the sevayats to reside in the said premises for the purposes of carrying on the daily and periodical seva and the festivals, etc., of the deity.\nthey are to be registered in the municipal records in the name of the

read together he was given full proprietary rights in the soil of the said villages.\nadmittedly,on the coming into force of the bombay merged territories and areas (jagirs abolition) act,1953 (hereinafter referred to as \"the act\") i.e.with effect from respondent's daljitgarh jagir stood abolished and all his rights in the jagir villages,save as expressly provided by or under the act,were extinguished and the respondent became entitled to compensation under s.11 of the act.\naccording to the respondent since the entries made in the revenue records in respect of his rights to mines and mineral products were not sufficient and proper ,he by his application requested the collector to issue necessary orders to the,idar,to make appropriate entries regarding his rights in the minerals in village isarwada.\nthereupon a notice under s.37(2) of the bombay land revenue code for the purpose of holding an inquiry into the rights of the respondent to mines and mineral products of the said villages claimed by the respondent wag served upon him but the respondent raised a preliminary objection that such inquiry wag misconceived and incompetent in view of the determination made under s.2 (4) (i) of the act and having regard to the provisions of s.10 of the act-his rights,to mines and mineral products were expressly saved.\nthe collector overruled the preliminary objection and directed

preferred a writ petition  under art.227 of the constitution to the,gujarat high court and writ of certiorari quashing the order and a direction restraining the collector from further proceeding with the inquiry under s.37(2) of the land revenue code were sought.\nthese reliefs sought by the respondent were resisted by the state of gujarat and the collector principally on the ground that the

or contract or law or custom or usage recognising such rights and this could only be determined by the collector by holding an inquiry under s.37(2) of the bombay land revenue code,and,therefore the

saved under s.10 of the act and in any event on the facts obtaining in the instant case the competent authority acting under s.2 (4) (i) of the act,while coming to the conclusion that the respondent's jagir was proprietary one,bad relied upon the unqualified nature of the grant and also considered the evidence led before it touching upon the several rights.\naccording to the learned counsel for the respondent unless a claim to property or rights over property was made either by the state against any person or by any person against the state,there could be no occasion for the collector to held an inquiry contemplated by s.37(2) of the code.\nhe,therefore,urged that the high court was right in quashing the collector's order\n\nISSUE\nthe main question raised in this appeal by special leave at the instance of state,of gujarat and the collector against the gujarat high court's judgment allowing the writ petition of the respondent is whether once the competent authority under s.2(4) (i) of the bombay merged territories and areas (jagirs abolition. act,1953  declares that a particular jagir is a proprietary one,\na further inquiry under s.37 (2) of the bombay land revenue code  with a view to determining whether the jagirdar had any rights to mines or mineral products in his jagir granted or recognised under any contract,grant or law for the time being in force or by custom or usage is competent.\nthe general question is whether once the competent authority under s.2 (4) (i) of the act declares that the particular jagir is a proprietary one a further inquiry under s.37(2) of the land revenue code with a view to determining whether the jagirdar had rights to mines and mineral products in such jagir subsisting on the appointed date is competent.\nthe other specific question is whether in the facts of the case and having regard to the nature of evidence considered and the specific finding made by the competent authority while determining the question under s.2(4. i),the further inquiry initiated by the collector under s.37(2) was misconceived and uncalled for.\n\nANALYSIS\ndealing with the first question which is of a general character,it is clear that the answer thereto depends upon the true scope and ambit of the inquiry under s.2 (4) (i) of the act and to determine the same it will be necessary to consider the scheme and object of the act and.in particular the purpose of the said inquiry.\nin the first place the,preamble and s.3 of the act clearly show that the object of the enactment is to abolish jagirs of all kinds in the merged territories and merged areas in the state of bombay and to convert all jagir villages into unalienated villages liable to the payment of land revenue in accordance with the provisions of the bombay land revenue code.\nsecondly,compensation is made payable under s.11 of the act to jagirdars whose jagirs and other incidental rights have been extinguished but it will be pertinent to note that no provision has been made for payment of compensation in respect of rights to mines and mineral products in a jagir village,obviously because if by the grant in question the jagirdar has not been given any rights to mines and mineral products no compensation would be payable and if there be a grant of mines and mineral products the same have been saved \"to the jagirdar under s.10 of the act.\nthirdly,the quantum of compensation payable for abolition of jagir and extinguishment of his other rights depends upon what kind of", "doc_id": "48175750-f5ee-4af7-b4d9-0581c5ef7170",

{"__data__": {"text": "abolition of jagir and extinguishment of his other rights depends upon what kind of jagir has been abolished,whether it is proprietary or non-proprietary; in other words it is clear that the inquiry into the nature of the jagir under s.2 (4) (i) is for the purpose of determining the quantum of compensation payable to a jagirdar inasmuch as in the case of.a non-proprietary jagir the jagirdar is entitled to compensation at the rate of three times the amount of land revenue received by or due to him as an incident of jagir during the five years immediately before the appointed date under s.11 (1),while in the case of a proprietary jagir in respect of land held by a permanent holder the jagirdar is entitled to compensation equivalent to three multiples of the assessment fixed for such land; s.11(3) provides for compensation and computation thereof to a jagirdar having any right or interest in any property referred to in s.8.in such an inquiry ordinarily no determination of any rights of the jagirdar to mines or mineral products in a jagir village will be undertaken for' no compensation is payable in respect of any rights to mines and mineral products in a jagir village.\nthere is yet one more aspect emerging from the definition of the expression \"proprietary jagir\" which leads to the same inference.\n\"proprietary jagir\" has been defined in s.2(xviii) to mean a jagir in respect of which the jagirdar under the terms of a grant or agreement or by custom or usage is entitled to any rights or interest in the soil.\nin other words,the competent authority holding an inquiry under s.2(4) (i) can come to the conclusion that a particular jagir is proprietary if it finds that the jagirdar under the terms of a grant or agreement is entitled to some rights or interest in the soil other than mines or mineral products.\nthese aspects bring out true scope and ambit of the inquiry under sec.2(4)(i) and clearly show that the determination of the question whether a jagir is proprietary or nonproprietary does not necessarily involve the determination of the question whether the jagirdar had any rights to mines and mineral products on the appointed date.\nit is true that prima facie the owner of the surface of the land would be entitled to everything beneath the land and ordinarily mines and mineral products would pass with the right to the surface but this would be so in the absence of any reservations made in the grant; if there be reservations or qualifications in regard to mines or mineral products,in the grant,then these would not pass.\nin other words,before the collector can initiate an inquiry under that provision,either the state or the individual must put forward a claim to a property or any right in or over the property and it is such claim that is to be inquired into by the collector whose decision,subject to a civil suit filed within one year,is rendered final.\nit is thus clear that by these two applications the respondent had not put forward any claim as such to excavating gravel and stones for the first time' but,had merely requested the making of appropriate entry with regard to his said right which had already been recognised by the state government previously.\nthat being the position,there was no occasion for the collector to initiate the inquiry under s.37(2) of the code-in fact,he had no jurisdiction to do so,the condition precedent not being satisfied. .\nbesides,while determining the proprietary nature of the grant under s.2(4)(1) of the act the competent authority had,on evidence led before it,alluded among others to the respondent's right to excavate and sell gravel and stones and enjoyment thereof by the respondent.\nin these circumstances it would be fair and proper that the respondent is not subjected to a further inquiry under.s.37(2) of the code\n\nSTATUTE\ns.2 of the bombay merged territories and areas (jagirs abolition. act,1953 ",

the state government exceeds its jurisdiction in entertaining the second revision?\n\nANALYSIS\nthe state government makes appointment of the revenue officers including the commissioner and the chief

a subordinate officer and the state government can satisfy itself as to the legality and propriety of any decision including the order passed in revision by the revenue officers.\nstate government itself appoints the revenue officers including the commissioner under the scheme of the code and all revenue officers are subordinate to the state government as per section 11 of the act,and even the

mean \"creative extension of traditional yakshagana\" and,thus,the appellants infringed the copyright thereof by performing the same at new delhi without obtaining her prior permission.\nit was stated that dr.karanth had composed seven verses or prasangas for staging yaksharanga ballet apart from bringing in changes in the traditional form thereof on its relevant aspects,namely,raga,tala,scenic

same is lodged by conditions and subject to statutory limitation.\nin r.g.anand vs.m/s delux films &amp; ors.[(1978) 4 scc 118]1978 indlaw sc 294,this court held the following.\n1.there can be no copyright in an idea,subject-matter,themes,plots or historical or legendary facts and violation of the copyright in such cases is confined to the form,manner and arrangement and expression of the idea by the author of the copyrighted work.\n2.where the same idea is being developed in a different manner,it is manifest that the source being common,similarities are bound to occur.\nin such a case the courts should determine whether or not the similarities are on fundamental or substantial aspects of the mode of expression adopted in the copyrighted work.\nif the defendant's work is nothing but a literal imitation of the copyrighted work with some variations here and there it would amount to violation of the copyright.\nin other words,in order to be actionable the copy must be a substantial and material one which at once leads to the conclusion that the defendant is guilty of an act of piracy.\n3.one of the surest and the safest test to determine whether or not there has been a violation of copyright is to see if the reader,spectator or the viewer after having read or seen both the works is clearly of the opinion and gets an unmistakable impression that the subsequent work appears to be a copy of the original.\n4.where the theme is the same but is presented and treated differently so that the subsequent work becomes a completely new work,no question of violation of copyright arises.\n5.where however apart from the similarities appearing in the two works there are also material and broad dissimilarities which negative the intention to copy the original and the coincidences appearing in the two works are clearly incidental no infringement of the copyright comes into existence.\n6.as a violation of copyright amounts to an act of piracy it must be proved by clear and cogent evidence after applying the various tests laid down by the case-law discussed above.\n7.where however the question is of the violation of the copyright of stage play by a film producer or a director the task of the plaintiff becomes more difficult to prove piracy.\nit is manifest that unlike a stage play a film has a much broader prospective,wider field and a bigger background where the defendants can by introducing a variety of incidents give a colour and complexion different from the manner in which the copyrighted work has expressed the idea.\nsection 52 of the act provides for

first time before this court.\nhe argued that the appellant has not taken the plea of the first respondent not being a 'person aggrieved' with respect to filing of the applications for rectification before the ipab; merely urging the plea that the first respondent has no locus standi in the written submissions before the ipab is not sufficient.\nlearned counsel would submit that the appellant has,for the first time,argued before this court that the first respondent is not a person aggrieved and/or not capable of maintaining the rectification proceedings with respect to each and every good

application under both sections,it is a pre-requisite that the applicant must be a person aggrieved.\nsection 46(1) of the 1958 act enables any person aggrieved to apply for removal of registered trade mark from the register on the ground of non use as stated in clause (a) and/or clause (b).\nto be an aggrieved person under section 46,he must be one whose interest is affected in some possible way; it must not be a fanciful suggestion of grievance.\na likelihood of some injury or damage to the applicant by such trade mark remaining on the register may meet the test of locus standi.\nin kerly's law of trade marks and trade names (11th edition) at page 166,the legal position with regard to 'person aggrieved' has been summarized thus the persons who are aggrieved are all persons who are in some way or the other substantially interested in having the mark removed where it is a question of removal from the register; including all persons who would be substantially damaged if the mark remained, and all trade rivals over whom an advantage was gained by a trader who was getting the benefit of a registered trade mark to which he was not entitled.\nthe court accept the above statement of law.\nsections 46 and 56 require 'person aggrieved' to apply for removal of the registered trade mark from the register or rectification of a trade mark in the register,the expression 'person aggrieved' for the purposes of these two sections has different connotations.\nin hardie trading ltd 2003 indlaw sc 756.(2003) 11 scc 92),this court stated that  the phrase \"person aggrieved\" is a common enough statutory precondition for a valid complaint or appeal.\nthe phrase has been variously construed depending on the context in which it occurs.\nthree sections viz.sections 46,56 and 69 of the act contain the phrase.\nsection 46 deals with the removal of a registered trade mark from the register on the ground of non-use.\nthis section presupposes that the

that in some possible way he may be damaged or injured if the trade mark is allowed to stand.\naddisons' application was one under section 46 and the test to determine whether the applicant was a \"person aggrieved\" within the meaning of that section should have been the one laid down by romer,j.in wright case and not the one propounded by the house of lords in the matter of powell's trade mark.\nin a recent decision in the case of kabushiki kaisha toshiba  (2008) 10 scc 766) 2008 indlaw sc 1395, this court stated that section 46 speaks for private interest while section 56 speaks of a public interest.\nin the first place,when the first respondent applied for rectification/removal in respect of three registrations in classes 7,9 and 16,it must have shown in respect of each of them that it is a 'person aggrieved' and the ipab must have separately considered in respect of each registration the locus standi of the first respondent as the considerations for each entry might not have been common.\nduring the pendency of the applications,certain events had taken place which had some bearing on the question of locus standi of the first respondent insofar as invocation of section 46 (1) of the 1958 act is concerned.\nin terms of section 46(1),not only that the applicant has to show that he is an aggrieved person as his interest is being affected but the ipab must also be satisfied,before it directs the removal of registered trade mark,that the applicant is an aggrieved person before it invokes the power in directing the removal of the  26 registered trade mark.\nthis is so because the pre-requisite for exercise of power under section 46(1) is that the applicant is a person aggrieved.\nin the circumstances, the court was satisfied that the applications made by the first respondent for rectification/removal of the subject trade marks from the register need to be considered afresh by the ipab in accordance with law and the observations made above.\nsince the first respondent has also grievance in connection with the impugned order particularly with regard to non-consideration of its case under section 56 of the 1958 act, the court refrained from going into the merits of the diverse contentions raised before us and leave the parties to agitate these contentions before the ipab.\n\nSTATUTE\ns.46 of the trade and merchandise marks

the tenants of suit properties and if that be so question of raising issue of tenancy by the civil court in the suit before it did not arise at all nor was it necessary to refer such issue to the mamlatdar under section 85-a of the bt &; al act and stay the suit till receipt of the finding on such issue as was directed by the high court in its judgment under appeal.\nthe argument which was strenuously advanced on behalf of the appellant -plaintiff was that in a suit for redemption filed by the mortgagor in a civil court in respect of property notwithstanding the plea of the defendants' claim that they were tenants of that property under the bt &; al act and under the provisions of that act the issue of tenancy had to be referred by the civil court to the mamlatdar for recording a finding thereon and the civil court can proceed to dispose of the suit only on the basis of the finding received from the mamlatdar,the civil court itself can record its finding on the issue of tenancy and if the finding to be recorded had to go against the claim of tenancy,it would be permissible for the civil court to grant the decree for redemption sought by the plaintiff in the said suit. support was sought for the argument from the decision of this court in topandas case 1963 indlaw sc 379\n\nISSUE\n(1).does the lease-hold of a tenant (lessee) in a property merge in mortgage

under the bt &; al act and seeks a reference of that issue by the civil court to the mamlatdar under that act for obtaining a finding thereon,can the civil court decide such issue by itself and proceed to decide the suit on the basis of the finding thereon.\nthe appeal in the court had arisen out of the finding recorded on that issue and in dealing with that matter this court had.to consider the true effect of sub-section (1) of section 28 of the rents control act to find whether it means that a defendant if raises a claim or question as to the existence of relationship of landlord and tenant between him and plaintiff the jurisdiction of the civil court is ousted even though the plaintiff pleaded that there is only exclusive jurisdiction to decide the case with the court of small causes,bombay.\n\nANALYSIS\nno controversy is raised in the appeal as regards the findings of the civil court that the deeds of mortgage executed by the plaintiff in respect of the suit properties were mortgages by conditional sale.\nin any event,it was not the case of the plaintiff that defendant-l was a tenant of the suit properties and hc surrendered his possession of the suit properties either expressly or impliedly and the possession so obtained by the plaintiff was re-delivered to defendant-l in pursuance of the mortgages by conditional sale executed in his favour.\nlearned counsel appearing for the defendants -respondents sought to refute the arguments advanced on half of the plaintiff-appellant.\nwhat is enunciated in section 111 (d) of the t.p.act cannot be doubted is the doctrine of merger.\nlease-hold held by a tenant or a lessee being a lesser estate and the right of reversion of the landlord (lessor) being a higher estate,the lessee's lease-hold right in respect of the property merges in reversion when that right of reversion,i.e.,the landlord's (lessor's) right of reversion comes to the tenant or lessee which happens when the landlord having a right to sell his reversion to the tenant holding the lease-hold sells the whole of it to the tenant (lessee).\nwhen the landlord mortgages the lease-hold property of the tenant to the tenant himself,he does not part with the right of reversion which he has in respect of that property.\nif that be so,merger of lease-hold estate in reversion cannot arise,inasmuch as,there cannot be any inconsistency or incompatibility in one person being the tenant and also the mortgagee of the same property,for in that event instead of the tenant paying rent to the landlord he may adjust it against the amount claimable by him as a mortgagee from the landlord.\nmoreover,if a lessee of a property takes a mortgage of the sum property from the landlord,it would be unreasonable to attribute to a tenant the intention to surrender the tenancy and to invoke the sophisticated doctrine of implied surrender as has been held by the gujarat high court in patel atmaram nathudas v. babubhai keshavlal.1974 indlaw guj 88.\nin the case of a mortgage the estate that is outstanding is the equity of redemption of the mortgagor.\ntherefore,there cannot be a merger of lease and mortgage in respect of the same property since neither of them is a higher or lesser estate than the other.\ng.appalaswamy case 1984 indlaw sc 314 (supra) which considered the question whether a sitting tenant who took property by a

computed only for 72 days.\nthe high court allowed the petition holding that twelve weeks for which maternity benefit is provided for in subs.(3) of s.5 of the act must be taken to mean twelve weeks

preceding and including the day on which her delivery occurs and the second one which is postnatal compulsory period consists of six weeks immediately following the day of delivery.\nthe benefit has to be calculated for the aforesaid two periods on the basis of the average daily wage.\naccording to the explanation appended to s.5(1) of the act,the average daily wage has to be computed taking into consideration the average of the woman's wager, payable to her for the days on which she has worked during the period of three calendar months immediately preceding the date from which she absents herself on account of maternity,or one rupee a day,whichever is higher.\nfor fixing the average daily wage,it has therefore first to be ascertained whether the wages with were paid or were payable to

court nalban fishery had been allotted to some members of the sarkar family and whether such decree would affect the rights of the state and bind the state of west bengal.\n\nANALYSIS\nthe nalban fishery was one of the items of property in the suit for partition is not disputed.\nit is also not disputed that the state of west bengal though was not a party to the suit but in course of proceeding before this court by an order of the court the said state of west bengal was impleaded as a party.\nthe aforesaid order directing impleadment of the state of west bengal as a 7 party was obviously intended for the purpose that the interest of the state and the rights of the state in relation of the state and the rights of the state in relation of the state and the rights of the state in relation to several fisheries could be protected.\nfurther while directing the receiver to handover possession of the various fisheries covered by the final decree to the parties to whom they have been allotted under the decree,this court also protected the interest of the state by observing that they made it quite clear that this will not in any manner prejudice or affect the right of the state to its claim over the fisheries under the west bengal acquisition act 1955 or under any other statute.\nit is an undisputed fact that nalban fishery had been requisitioned much prior to the aforesaid decree of this court and,therefore,the rights of the state to the fishery either by virtue of the requisition order or by virtue of any provision of any other statute remained protected and as such said state of west bengal can't be bound down by the so-called allotment of fisheries in favour of some members of the sarkar family under the compromise decree in question.\nthe district magistrate 24 parganas who was appointed as receiver took possession of several fisheries including nalban fishery obviously on the impression that the lease in respect of the said fishery which had been granted by the sarkar family had lapsed.\nthe said receiver was not aware of the fact that nalban fishery had in fact requisitioned by the state of west bengal and the state is in possession of the same.\nthe successor receiver,in the circumstances,therefore,was fully justified in bringing it to the notice of this court by giving a second report indicating therein that his predecessor had erroneously taken the possession of nalban fishery which is in contravention of the directions of this court and for which the receiver offered his unconditional apology.\nthe court did not find any illegality in the act of the succeeding receiver in rectifying the earlier mistake and re-delivering the possession of nalban fishery to the state of west bengal.\nthe aforesaid order cannot be held to operate as res judicata taking away the rights of the state of west bengal in respect of the nalban fishery as the state was not a party to the proceedings.\nthe rights and interest of the state of west bengal was not in any way be affected by the so-called partition and allotment of the nalban fishery inter se amongst the members of the sarkar family,the order passed by the learned single judge of the calcutta high court will not stand on the way of the state in claiming and putting forth its interest and right over the nalban fishery.\n\nSTATUTE\nthe suit ultimately no doubt was disposed of on the basis of a compromise arrived at between the parties but the court took sufficient care in disposing of the appeals on the terms of compromise by observing that the state has substantial interest with regard to fisheries rights covered by the litigation and nothing in the decree will not affect the rights of the state of west bengal in any manner whatsoever", "doc_id":

named as \"sail gulshan\" with a vast extent of land and palaces with roads and surrounded by a compound wail measuring 19 acres and 10 guntas situated in the heart of hyderabad city near sarojini devi hospital.\nthe property in question was taken possession of on or about 12th of september,1963.\nthe  appeal concerned with the claim for compensation for the said acquisition by one abdul khader who was a flower picker.\nhe had claimed rights as a tenant during the requisition.\nhis claim for compensation for requisition was settled by sharing the rent in or about 1969.\nthe appellant is one of the owners of the property in question deriving their title and right from the said sail nawaz jung.\non or about 3rd february,1970 the collector issued notice for acquisition of the property

defined in clause (b) of s.3 of the land acquisition act.\nhe has a right to object to the acquisition and/or the quantum of compensation.\nthe land acquisition officer or the court,as the case may

dispute started between the parties with regard to the electricity connection in the house.\nthe deceased tried to put off the light of one particular room at which the appellant and other accused persons became annoyed and the appellant switched on the light which was again switched off by the deceased.\nat this, the deceased became annoyed and the appellant removed the fuse of the electricity which act of his plunged the entire house into darkness.\nit is also clear and established that thereafter a lamp was brought by accused no. 3 to the room besides another lamp which was already burning in the said room itself.\nbut, in any case, there was an electricity light post in the front of the house which was giving enough light to the house.\nthere is also evidence on record to show that even outsiders were watching the incident from the road which indicates that there was sufficient light for them to see what was happening in the house where the incident had taken place.\nthere was indeed some scuffle between the parties during the course of which accused no. 1 received simple injuries and the deceased died of the two stab injuries inflicted by the present appellant.\nthe issue with regard to the initiation of the investigation without recording the fir was succinctly addressed by this court in the case of state of u.p. v. bhagwant kishore joshi, (1964) 3 scr 71 1963 indlaw sc 268, observed as follows: \"17. what is investigation is not defined in the code of criminal procedure; but in h.n. rishbud and inder singh v. state of delhi 1954 indlaw sc 14 this court has described, the procedure, for investigation as follows: \"thus, under the code investigation consists generally of the following steps, (1) proceeding to the spot, (2) ascertainment of the facts and circumstances of the case, (3) discovery and arrest of the suspected offender, (4) collection of evidence relating to the commission of the offence which may consist of (a) the examination of various persons (including the accused) and the reduction of their statements into writing, if the officer thinks fit, (b) the search of places of seizure of things considered necessary for the investigation and to be produced at the trial, and (5) formation of the opinion as to whether on the material collected there is a case to place the accused before a magistrate for trial and if so taking the necessary steps for the same by the filing of a charge-sheet\"\nin the instant case, it is quite clear from the evidence on record that pw-1 received the information about the death of the deceased from psi of panaji police station without any detail as to how the incident had happened and who had caused the incident.\nit was a very cryptic information received by him regarding the death of a person residing within the jurisdiction of his police station pursuant to an incident taking place on 10.04.1988 between 8.30 p.m. to 8.45 p.m. and, therefore, it appears that there was not enough information available to him either to get a g.d. entry recorded or to get an fir lodged.\nin order to verify the information received, pw-21 went to the place of occurrence and found the entire house in total darkness.\nthe said eye-witnesses are consistent about the principal act of the appellant in stabbing the deceased.\nthe discrepancies which were sought to be pointed out are minor discrepancies without in any manner affecting the substratum of the prosecution case and therefore, minor discrepancies in the evidence of the eye-witnesses are immaterial.\nthe postmortem report indicates that there were sixteen injuries as against the two as adduced in ocular evidence and, therefore, a submission was made by the counsel appearing for the appellant that the medical evidence adduced in the present case is not supporting the ocular evidence.\nthe place of occurrence", "doc_id": "40ab0647-554f-45e7-970f-8523e0ec4e72", "embedding": null, "doc_hash":

course of scuffle the appellant also received an injury which was simple in nature and that there was heated exchange of words and scuffle between the parties before the actual incident of stabbing took place.\nthere is, therefore, provocation and the incident happened at the spur of the moment.\nthat being the factual position, we are of the considered view that the present case cannot be said to be a case u/s. but it is a case falling under s. 304 part ii ipc.\nit is trite law that s. 304 part ii comes into play when the death is caused by doing an act with knowledge that it is likely to cause death but there is no intention on the part of the accused either to cause death or to cause such bodily injury as is likely to cause death.\n\nSTATUTE\ns. 299 and s. 300 ipc deals with the definition of culpable homicide and murder respectively.\ns. 299 defines culpable homicide as the act of causing death; (i) with the intention of causing death or (ii) with the intention of causing such bodily injury as is likely to cause death or (iii) with the knowledge that such act is likely to cause death. the bare reading of the section makes it crystal clear that the first and the second clause of the section refer to intention apart from the knowledge and the third clause refers to knowledge alone and not intention. both the expression \"intent\" and \"knowledge\" postulate the existence of a positive mental attitude which is of different degrees.\nthe mental element in culpable homicide i.e. mental attitude towards the consequences of conduct is one of intention and knowledge.\nif that is caused in any of the aforesaid three circumstances, the offence of culpable homicide is said to have been committed.\n. 300 ipc, however, deals with murder although there is no clear definition of murder provided in s. 300 ipc.\nit has been repeatedly held by this court that culpable homicide is the genus and murder is species and that all murders are culpable homicide but not vice versa.\ns. 300 ipc further provides for the exceptions which will constitute culpable homicide not amounting to murder and punishable u/s.\nwhen and if there is intent and knowledge then the same would be a case of s. 304. part. i and if it is only a case of knowledge and not the intention to cause murder and bodily injury, then the same would be a case of s. 304 part ii.\nthe aforesaid distinction between an act amounting to murder and an act not amounting to murder has been brought out in the numerous decisions of this court.\n\n", "doc_id": "bc180704-f9f5-4edb-a48b-3918321ac03d",

claimed to be the tenant in respect of the two premises which are quite adjacent to each other,one of which is involved in this appeal.\nthe respondent who is the landlord of the two premises  leased out to the appelllant and father, for conducting the business in the name of ahmedabad fine.\nthe appellant no.1 had closed the business and he was not using the said premises for the purpose for which it was let to him.\nit was the case of the appellant that in respect of the suit premises he was carrying on his business with respondents. nos.2,4 and 5 in the name of respondent no.2,m/s. bharat neon signs.\nthe main controversy was whether the appellant had sublet the premises to defendant no.2,bharat neon signs or whether he being a partner of the said firm had permitted the said firm to use the premises in question.\npartnership deed records six persons who were to run the business in manufacturing and selling bharat neon signs tubes.\non or about 24th of october,1960. another partnership deed being exhibit-69 came to be executed among the six persons and the father of the appellant girdharlal\n\nARGUMENT\nhe has stated further that the suit premises were to be used for business and he could use it for any business and he joined in partnership with defendants nos.2 to 5 somewhere in 1961 to prepare neon signs and the defendants nos.2 to 5 were his partners and doing business in the suit premises.\nhe contended further that the suit premises was with him and the defendants nos.2 to 5 had not acquired any tenancy rights in the suit premises.\nit is further stated that he had filed a civil suit to dissolve the partnership and to take account and his suit was pending in city civil court.\nit was contended by mr. mehta that there was no agency; reading the partnership deeds as we have read that conclusion does not emanate from position appearing debiting the fixed amount payable to the appellant in the expenses account which also is not inconsistent with partnership.\n\nISSUE\nwhether the appellant herein and his father had sublet the premises in question in or about 1960 in terms of section 13(1)(e) of the bombay rents,hotel and lodging house rates control act,1947. hereinafter called the 'rent act') is' the question involved in this appeal by special leave from the judgment and order of the high court of gujarat dated 21st of august,1979.\nthe main question in issue in this appeal as well as before the high court in revision was whether there was a genuine partnership at the appellant was a partner.\n\nANALYSIS\nthe partnership deed exhibit-114 was executed by six persons and at that stage the appellant or his father were not partners in the firm.\nbut thereafter when the partnership deed exhibit-69 was executed the appellant and his father joined the firm with an agreement to share profits only and their share was fixed at 0.03 paise in a rupee.\nthere is a third partnership deed exhibit-70 which showed that the deceased tenant girdharlal had died on 1st of february,1961 and so by the remaining seven partners with same terms and conditions,a new partnership deed being exhibit-70 was executed on 22nd. september,1961.at this time the share of the appellant was fixed at 0.03 paise in a rupee to share the profits only.\nit is well settled that if there was such a partnership firm of which the appellant was a partner as a tenant the same would not amount to subletting leading to the forfeiture of the tenancy.\nfor this proposition see the decision of the gujarat high court in the case of

inflicted on her for non-giving of dowry.\nit was appropriate for the court to examine as to what are the ingredients of an offence punishable under section 304b of the ipc.\nin the case of biswajit halder alias babu halder and others v.state of w.b.[(2008) 1 scc 202 2007 indlaw sc 304],the court stated the basic ingredients to attract the provisions of section 304-b are (1) the death of a woman should be caused by burns or fatal injury or otherwise than under normal circumstances; (2) such death should have occurred within seven years of her marriage; (3) she must have been subjected to cruelty or harassment by her husband or any relative of her husband; and (4) such cruelty or harassment should be for or in connection with demand for dowry.\nfor the purpose of section 113-b of the evidence act, 'dowry death' shall have the same meaning as in section 304-b of indian penal code.\nif section 304-b ipc is read together with section 113-b of the evidence act,a comprehensive picture emerges that if a married woman dies in unnatural circumstances at her matrimonial home within 7 years from her marriage and there are allegations of cruelty or harassment upon such married woman for or in connection with demand of dowry by the husband or relatives of the husband,the case would squarely come under \"dowry death\" and there shall be a presumption against the husband and the relatives.\nwhere the husband had demanded a specific sum from his father-in-law and upon not being given,harassed and tortured the wife and after some days she died,such cases would clearly fall within the definition of \"dowry\" under the act.s.4 of the act is the penal section and demanding a \"dowry\",as defined under s.2 of the act,is punishable under this section.\nas already noticed,the court need not deliberate on this aspect,as the accused before the court has neither been charged nor punished for that offence.\nthe court examined the provisions of s.2 of the act in a very limited sphere to deal with the contentions raised in regard to the applicability of the provisions of section 304-b of the code.\nthe court cannot ignore one of the cardinal principles of criminal jurisprudence that a suspect in the indian law is entitled to the protection of art.20 of the constitution of india as well as has a presumption of innocence in his favour.\nin other words,the rule of law requires a person to be innocent till proved guilty.\nthe concept of deeming fiction is hardly applicable to the criminal jurisprudence.\nin contradistinction to this aspect,the legislature has applied the concept of deeming fiction to the provisions of section 304-b.\nwhere other ingredients of section 304-b are satisfied,in that event,the husband or all relatives shall be deemed to have caused her death.\nin other words,the offence shall be deemed to have been committed by fiction of law.\nonce the prosecution proves its case with regard to the basic ingredients of section 304-b,the court will presume by deemed fiction of law that the husband or the relatives complained of,has caused her death.\nsuch a presumption can be drawn by the court keeping in view the evidence produced by the prosecution in support of the substantive charge under section 304-b of the code.\nthe ingredients of section 304b read with section 498a ipc are completely satisfied in the present case.\nthe accused did not care to explain as to how the death of his wife occurred.\ndenial cannot be treated to be the discharge of onus.\nonus has to be discharged by leading proper and cogent evidence.\nit

should not be sold in discharge of the liabilities can be taken at the initial stage by filing an application in terms of sub-s.

(3) of s. 3 are clear. by reason thereof, the property that belongs to a notified person stands attached simultaneously with the issue of the notification that makes him a notified party. the words \"on and from the date of notification\" indicate the point of time at which the attachment takes effect; this is reiterated by the words \"shall stand attached simultaneously with the issue of the notification\".\nthis also indicates that no separate notification or order in regard to the attachment is necessary.\nneither the words \"on and from the date of notification\" nor the word 'property' lead to the conclusion that what is attached is not only that property which the notified person owned or was possessed of on the date of the notification but also all such property as he might acquire at any time thereafter.\nthe intention to attach property which did not belong to the notified person on the date of the notification but which he might acquire later would, had it been there, have been clearly expressed and sub-s.

the correctness or otherwise of the said contention of the appellants at this stage, however, there cannot be any doubt whatsoever that they being notified persons, all their properties would be deemed to be automatically attached as a consequent thereto. for the said purpose, it is not necessary that they should be accused of commission of an offence as such.\nthe principle of lifting the

consider the question having regard to the overall picture.\nthe authorities of dri themselves categorically stated that the activities of appellant after 11.10.2003 were not in question and in fact all the bank accounts were defreezed.\nalthough learned additional solicitor general may be correct in his submissions that ordinarily we should not exercise our discretionary jurisdiction u/art.136

one of the divisions of tata sons limited.\nit functions as a consulting organisation and a service industry,and does not manufacture any product or carry on trade.its work force consists of engineers and supervisors and different categories of workmen.\nthe tata consultant employees union served a charter of demands in july,1974,on the appellant,and as their demands were not accepted and conciliation proceedings proved fruitless,the state government made a reference of the dispute under s.10(1)(d),industrial tribunal,maharashtra for adjudication.\nthe union filed a statement before the tribunal claiming an upward revision of the wage scales and dearness allowance and an increase from fifteen years to twenty years in the span for earning annual increments.\nit was urged that the efficiency bar,as a feature of the wage scales,should be removed.\nthe dearness allowance,it was claimed,should be granted on a slab system.\nthe claim of the union was resisted by the appellant,who maintained that the existing wage scales were fair and reasonable on a region-cum-industry basis and that it would not be possible for the appellant to bear the additional financial burden if the demands of the union were accepted.\nthe appellant had introduced various pay scales in 1973 and some time later they were revised.\nthere was no separate dearness allowance until january,1977 when it was introduced for the first time.\nhouse rent allowance was also paid.\ndearness allowance became payable at 10% of the basic wage subject to a minimum of rs.50/ and house rent allowance at 30% of the basic salary.\nthe tribunal observed that compared with the increased paying capacity of the appellant,an inference drawn from the prosperity enjoyed by the appellant over the years,there was definite need for revising the wage scales.\nit also laid down the principle enabling the actual fitment of the workmen in their respective wage scales as on that date and also provided for the number of increments to which they would be entitled having regard to the period of completed service.\ntwo days after the award was made,an application was made by the union stating: \"in the said award,your honour has observed,at the end of para 22,in view of the increase that is being allowed in the basic pay,i do not propose to revise the existing scheme of dearness allowance.\"\nthe workmen have filed an appeal by special leave, in which they have challenged the rejection by the tribunal of their claim in respect of dearness allowance which,they contend,should be pegged to the cost of living index and should not be a fixed amount.\n\nARGUMENT\nconsidering the appeal of tata consulting engineers first,the contention of learned counsel for the appellant is that having regard to the financial capacity of the appellant the tribunal erred in making the wage scales retrospective and,in any event,in ranging the retrospectivity back to 1st january,1976.\nthe learned counsel for the appellant had covered a wide field,but in the end he states that the appellant is aggrieved by two matters only.\none is the retrospectivity attached to the revised wage scales,and the other is the flat increase given to each employee of rs.150/-in the category of draughtsmen and rs.100/-in other categories resulting from the order dated 22nd december,1978.\nit is urged that the amendment results in the inclusion of a flat increase of rs.150/-to each workman in the case of draughtsman and rs.100/-to each workman in the case of other categories,a result wholly unwarranted,it is said,by the intent of the original award and,therefore,falling beyond the jurisdiction of the tribunal.\nthe only contention of the workmen is that the tribunal should have fixed the dearness allowance in

considered by the industrial tribunal,in making the award dated december 20,1978 was the question of revision of the wage-scales.\nimplicit and intrinsically connected with the question of revision of the wage-scales were the questions of fitment of employees into the wage-scales and flat or ad-hoc increase of salaries of workmen wherever considered necessary.\n\nANALYSIS\nit must be remembered that although the wage scales were introduced as long ago as 1973 they were maintained at that level except for a slight revision some time thereafter.\nno dearness allowance was paid until the beginning of 1977 and the house rent allowance also was introduced about that time.\nthe cost of living had gone on increasing from 1972 onwards and,as the tribunal has found,the dearness allowance and house rent allowance made no appreciable impact in neutralising the increasing cost.\nduring all these years,the appellant had continued to enjoy increasing profits; nonetheless the emoluments received by the workmen did not receive the impress of the appellant's growing prosperity.\nthe charter of demands was presented by the union in july,1974 and when conciliation proceedings failed the state government made the reference to the industrial tribunal in 1975.\nthey are considerations which cannot be ignored.\naccordingly,the contention raised on behalf of the appellant against retrospectivity of the wage scales must be rejected.\nthe financial capacity of the appellant,and the related study of its annual profits from 1968 to 1977,were examined from that view point.\nthe sufficiency of the existing pay scales was considered in detail,and regard was had to their original structure and the accretions made subsequently by way of dearness allowance and house rent allowance.\nfor the purpose of restructuring the pay scales the tribunal ruled on the paying capacity of the appellant,both with reference to the profits of the preceding year as well as the prospects of the future.\nthe financial capacity,as the tribunal observed,constituted one of \"the principles which are required to be followed in the fixation of the wage structure.\"\nno ad hoc increase to the pay of each individual workman was intended.\nthe jurisdiction given to the tribunal by rule 31 is closely circumscribed.\nit is only a clerical mistake or error which can be corrected,and the clerical mistake or error must arise from an accidental slip or omission in the award.\nan accidental slip or omission implies that something was intended and contrary to that intention what should not have been included has been included or what should have been included has been omitted.\nit must be a mistake or error amenable to clerical correction only.\nit must not be a mistake or error which calls for rectification by modification of the conscious adjudication on the issues involved.\nthe omission of the words to each employee first after the figure rs.150/-and again after the figure rs.100/-was clearly an accidental slip or omission which the tribunal was entitled to correct.\nit will be noted that the pay scales of different categories were being restructured,and the flat increase envisaged there related to an increase in the general pay scales of different categories.\nindividual workmen were not present to the mind of the tribunal.\nthat the increase was pertinent to the general pay scales in the revised wage structure is patently clear from a comparison of the existing pay scales and the revised pay scales.\nthe comparative table of existing pay scales and the revised pay scales has been reproduced earlier.\nthe revised pay scales of all categories,except the category of draughtsmen,shows an increase of rs.100/-in the initial pay fixed in each scale,the increase in the case of the category of draughtsmen being rs.150/.\nthe amendment made by the tribunal has the effect of providing a second increase,this time to each individual workmen.\nif,as the tribunal has stated in the amendment order,the increase in paragraph 23 was intended to apply to", "doc_id": "d8160afb-7ec2-4bca-b9a9-a05f136e2d94", "embedding": null, "doc_hash":

of the category of draughtsmen and rs.100/-in the case of other categories.\nconsidering the fitment of the workman in the revised scales,it was stated in the award that a workman found drawing a salary less than the beginning of the grade would be stepped up to the beginning of the grade and if his pay fell between two steps in the reclassified pay scales the basic pay was to be fixed at the step higher in the revised scale.\nreliance was placed on the hindustan times ltd.,new delhi v.their workmen [1964] 1 scr 234 1962 indlaw sc 436,247 where it was observed by this court that dearness allowance should not remain fixed at any figure but should be on a sliding scale in order to neutralise a portion of the increase in the cost of living.\nnow,it is not a universal rule that the dearness allowance should in all cases be correlated with the cost of living index.\nit was open to the tribunal to adopt the position which it did.\nif the dearness allowance is linked with the cost of living index the whole award will have to be reopened and the entire basis on which it has been made will have to be reconsidered.\nthe award is a composite document in which the several elements of increased wage scales,larger increments,longer span of 20 years for earning increments,dearness allowance at 10% of the basic wage,besides several other benefits,have been integrated into a balanced arrangement in keeping with what the tribunal has found to be the financial capacity of the appellant.\nit is not possible to maintain one part of the award and supersede another.\nconspicuous by its absence is any reference to a flat increase in the pay of an individual workmen.\nwe are not impressed with the submission that the corrigendum was in effect a fresh

different mode and we are not disposed to interfere with the award of the tribunal.\n\nSTATUTE\nin making the application of 22nd december,1978,the union invoked the jurisdiction of the tribunal under

in any award it or he issues.\nthe application before the tribunal was filed under rule 31 of the bombay industrial disputes rules 1957,which is as follows: \"a board,court,labour court,tribunal or

respondents,resisted the contentions.\naccording to the learned counsel,the respondents have collaboration agreement with sen raleigh which was taken over by the government under idr act and the appellant came to manufacture,with the technical know-how supplied by the respondents,the raleigh bicycles under the trade mark registered by the respondents in the register of the registrar under the

disputed across the bar,that the appellant had entered into an agreement with sen raleigh which was a permitted user and used the trade mark till november 1,1976 and thereafter by registered user agreement dated december 20,1976 used trade mark for a period of 5 years.\nit is not in dispute that till date of filing of the application,the appellant used the trade mark in passing off the bicycles under the trade mark of the respondent.\nto get a trade mark registered without any intention to use it in relation to any goods but merely to make money out of it by selling it to others,the right to use it as a commodity would be trafficking in that trade mark. it requires to be prevented and prohibited.\nthe court would not lend assistance to such registered proprietors of the trade mark.\nthere must be real trade connection between the proprietor of the trade and licensee of the goods and the intention to use the trade mark must exist at the date of the application for registration of trade mark and such intention must be genuine and bona fide and continue to subsist in order to disprove the charge of trafficking in trade mark.\nit is a question of fact in every case.\nthe question is: whether the trade connection exists to dispel the charge of trafficking in the trade mark.\nthough the deemed presumption under sub-s.(2) of s.48 is referable to the permitted user or the registered user and it does not extend to unregistered permitted user,the connecting link of passing off the goods between the licensor's trade mark and the lincesee should bona fide be

appellant herein, was tried and convicted by the additional sessions judge, sangrur for the murder of his niece mukhtiar kaur and was awarded the death penalty.\nin addition, he was convicted for an offence punishable u/s. 376 of the ipc and sentenced to undergo rigorous imprisonment for 10 years and to a fine of rs.5, 000/- and in default of payment to undergo further r.i. for one year and u/s. 309 of the ipc to a sentence of simple imprisonment for one year.\nthe aforesaid convictions and sentences have been maintained by the high court and the matter is before us in these proceedings by way of special leave.\nat about 2.00 p.m. on 10th november 2002 a boy whose identity is not forthcoming, informed satnam singh pw2 that an incident of firing had taken place in the house of ujjagar singh .\nsatnam singh conveyed this information to sarpanch jora singh pw1 who was attending a marriage at that time.\njora singh accompanied by gurdeep singh pw3 thereupon rushed to ujjagar singh's house and found mukhtiar kaur lying dead with a gun shot injury and the appellant also with a gun shot injury lying unconscious on the ground in the adjoining room.\nit appears that mukhtiar kaur's relations with her in-laws had got strained and she had left her matrimonial home and come to live with ujjagar singh, her uncle, 7 or 8 months earlier and the suggestion was that mukhtiar kaur had been killed by the appellant with his licensed gun and he had thereafter attempted to commit suicide.\n\nARGUMENT\nthe learned counsel for the accused has raised several arguments in the course of hearing.\nhe has pointed out that there was absolutely no evidence to suggest that mukhtiar kaur had been subjected to rape and in this view of the matter the very basis for the imposition of the death penalty was not made out.\nhe has also pointed out that there were no eye witnesses to the incident and the 4 witnesses i.e. jora singh and others who had reached the place of incident and carried the injured appellant to the hospital had also resiled and as the prosecution story now rested on circumstantial evidence alone, it was imperative for the investigating officer to have taken the finger prints from the weapon and that in any case the recovery of the spent cartridges and the gun were clearly suspicious as the weapon had been sent to the laboratory after an inordinate delay.\nit has also been submitted that in a case of attempted suicide a firearm must of necessity be used from a very close range and the absence of any blackening, charring or burning around the wound on ujjagar singh clearly ruled out the possibility of such an attempt.\nit has finally been submitted that the land had been transferred in the name of ujjagar singh's sons in the year 1994 by gurmail kaur, mother of mukhtiar kaur by a collusive decree and there was no evidence to show that mukhtiar kaur had ever displayed any unhappiness or made any complaint to any person or any authority with regard to the decree and as such, the very basis of the prosecution story did not exist.\nhe had laid great emphasis on the fact that no reference to the gun or cartridges had been made in the inquest report and that in any case the weapon and the spent cartridges had been sent to the laboratory belatedly.\n\nISSUE\nconvictions and sentences by the high court should be maintained or not?\n\nANALYSIS\nfrom the medical evidence and from the chemical examiner's reports that the vaginal swab and clothes taken from the dead body did indicate the presence of semen.\nthere is however absolutely no evidence to suggest (even assuming that the intercourse had been committed by the appellant) that he had done so without mukhtiar kaur's consent or against her will.\nit is also

{"text": "to have the appellant medically examined to ascertain his capacity to perform sexual intercourse.\nit must nonetheless be emphasized that whether a chain is complete or not would depend on the facts of each case emanating from the evidence and no universal yardstick should ever be attempted.\nit is in this background that we must examine the circumstances in the present case.\na few facts stand out from the prosecution story.\nfirst, the place of incident being adjoining rooms in the residential house of the appellant and the fact that the alleged murder weapon is his licensed dbbl gun is proved on record.\nthe evidence also reveals that the appellant was living in the premises along with his wife, mother and son, and two daughters, who were studying outside the village, were frequent visitors, but it is the admitted position that nobody but the appellant and the deceased were present at the time of incident.\nit is also clear from the evidence that the two spent cartridge cases recovered, one from near mukhtiar kaur's dead body, and the second from the right barrel of the gun lying near the appellant had been sent to the forensic science laboratory which opined that one of the cartridges had been fired from the gun and the other could have been fired therefrom.\nit is true that in a case relating to circumstantial evidence motive does assume great importance but to say that the absence of motive would dislodge the entire prosecution story is perhaps giving this one factor an importance which is not due and (to use the clichi. the motive is in the mind of the accused and can seldom be fathomed with any degree of accuracy.\nthere is however a hint in the testimony of pw14 inspector harjinder pal singh that his enquiries had revealed that the accused was having illicit relations with mukhtiar kaur and we can assume that some thing untoward had happened which could have triggered the volatile and hostile incident.\nthere could perhaps be some truth in this suggestion, as it is significant that though the appellant had an extended family living with him i.e. mother, wife, son living (in the village) and two young daughters who were studying outside and residing in a hostel, but were frequent visitors home, yet none of them has come forth to depose in his favour.\ntherefore, this is yet another circumstance inculpating the accused.\nit is also significant that the shot had apparently travelled upwards skirting the mandible, through the flesh of the cheek in an upward direction with minimal damage to the bone structure and it is indeed providential that the appellant got away with only an injury, albeit a very serious one.\nthe fact that the shot was fired from below going upwards is also supported by the site plan exh. pjj wherein marks of a shot hitting the roof were seen at point e whereas the appellant was found lying at point d in the same room.\nit is therefore apparent that the weapon had indeed been fired by the appellant from a close range and that the blackened portion around the wound had been removed by dr. sanjay uppal.\nit is true that it is generally for the prosecution to prove its case beyond doubt but in circumstances such as the present one, some explanation is also due from an accused in order to absolve himself from suspicion of the crime.\nno part of the evidence of the hostile witnesses comes to the aid of the appellant.\nthe question now arises as to the sentence that should be imposed on the appellant.\nit would be seen that both the sessions court and the high court were appalled by the allegations and findings of incestuous rape and murder.\nwe are however of the opinion, as already noted above, that a case of rape has not been made out.\nin this background the death sentence is not called for.\n\nSTATUTE\nsection 376, 309 of ipc\n\n", "doc_id": "8cf0920c-3986-4519-b4f5-293f59de37ca", "embedding": null, "doc_hash":

your lifetime, enjoy the aforesaid entire properties , enjoy the aforesaid entire properties, the outstandings due to me, the debts payable by me, and the chit amounts payable by me. after your

and obtained a deed of release from her.\nramalakshmi died during the lifetime of the widow.\nthe widow describing herself as an absolute owner of the properties of her husband sold one of the items of the property to the 2nd defendant.\non the 18th september, 1945, the suit out of which this appeal arises was instituted by the plaintiff, the husband and the sole heir of ramalakshmi, for a declaration that the said sale would not be binding on him beyond the lifetime of the widow.\na prayer was made that the widow be restrained from alienating the other properties in her possession.\nan ad interim injunction was issued by the high court restraining the widow from alienating the properties in her possession and forming part of her husband's estate.\ninspite of this injunction, she executed two deeds of settlement in favour of the other defendants comprising a number of properties.\nthe main issue in the suit was whether the widow took under the will an absolute estate or an estate like the hindu widow's estate and whether the daughter's interest therein was in the nature of a contingent remainder, or whether she got in the properties a vested interest.\n\nARGUMENT\nit was urged by mr. rajah iyer that as no express or implied power of alienation for purposes of all legal necessities was conferred on the widow, that circumstance negatived the view that the testator intended to confer upon his widow a hindu widow's estate as she would get in case of intestacy. he also emphasized that the words of the gift over to the daughter as supporting his construction which was further reinforced by the words of the will limiting the widow's estate \" till your lifetime \" and of the omission from therein of words such as nialik etc., while describing the widow's estate. mr. krisbnaswami lyengar, on the other hand, contended that the absence of any words in the will restricting her powers of alienation and putting a restraint on them, suggested a contrary intention and that the daughter's estate was described as coming into being after the estate of the widow and was not conferred on her simultaneously with the widow, and this connoted according to the notions of hindus a full hindu widow's estate.\n\nISSUE\nthe construction of will is in controversy in this appeal.\nthe substantial question to decide in the appeal is whether the estate granted by the testator to his widow was a fall woman's estate under hindu law or merely a limited life estate in the english sense of that expression\n\nANALYSIS\nthe decision of the appeal turns upon the question

widow ail ordinary life, estate or an estate analogous to that of a hindu widow.\nat one time it was a moot point whether a hindu widow's estate could be created by will, it being an estate created by law, but it is now settled that a hindu can confer by means of a will oil his widow the same estate which she would get by inheritance.\nthe court's primary duty in such cases is to ascertain from the language employed by the testator \"what were his intentions\", keeping in view the surrounding circumstances, his ordinary notions as a hindu in respect to devolution of his property, his family relationships etc.\nconsidering the will in the light of these principles, it seems  that lakshminarayan iyer intended by his will to direct that his entire properties should be enjoyed by his widow during her lifetime but her interest in these properties should come to an end on her death, that all these properties in their entirety should thereafter be enjoyed as absolute owners by his daughter and her heirs with powers of alienation, gift, exchange and sale from generation to generation.\nhe wished to make his daughter a fresh stock of descent so that her issue, male or female, may have the benefit of his property.\nthey were the real persons whom he earmarked with certainty as the ultimate recipients of his bounty.\nif not, the testator would clearly have said that the daughter would only take the properties remaining after the death of the widow.\nthe widow cannot be held to have been given a full hindu widow's estate under the will unless power of alienation in express terms was

(the niece) was an estate such as a woman ordinarily acquires by inheritance under the hindu law which she holds in a completely representative character but is unable to alienate except in case of legal necessity and that such a construction was in accordance with the ordinary notions that a hindu has in regard to devolution of his property.\nin pavani subbamma v. ammala rama naidu (1937) 1

it indicated that the prior gift in favour of the widow was only of a limited interest.\ngenerally speaking, there will be no point in making a will if what is to be given to a widow is what she would get on intestacy and cases do arise where a hindu wishes to give to his widow a more restricted estate than she would get on intestacy or a much larger estate than that.\nwhat is given must be gathered from the language of the will in the light of the surrounding circumstances.\nthe language used in the will was consistent with the testator's intention of conferring a life estate in the

university,could not be inconsistent with the provisions of the central act.\nthe university could not,therefore,in any event have sought for 'approval' of the state government.\nthe state government in its counter then gave the names of the existing colleges and their location.\nthe court observed that there was widespread student prospects against starting new colleges and it was necessary to be cautious in the matter of starting new engineering colleges.\ngovernment could not initially take a decision on the appellant's affiliation because of elections and that matter being one of 'major

shipping company limited is engaged in the business of shipping and allied activities and owns a fleet of tanker vessels for charter,including the vessel known as jag praja.\nan agreement,called the time charter party in legal parlance,was entered into between the appellant and the respondent on 6th may,1997 for letting on hire vessels for a period of two years from 22nd september,1996 to 30th

agreement dated 6th may,1997 beyond 30th june,1998 for a period of one month from 1st july,1998 with option for two further extensions of 15 days each.\nthe respondent agreed to the said proposal.

of 15 days each.\nthe terms and conditions; exceptions and exemptions contained in the charter party dated 6th may,1997 remained unaltered.\nthe parties are ad idem that the charter party dated 6th may,1997 was extended till 31st august,1998. it appears that since charter party dated 6th may,1997 was coming to an end on 31st august,1998,the oil companies sought permission of the oil co-ordination committee,a wing of the ministry of petroleum and natural gas for further extension of the charter party.\nhowever,the oil coordination committee,by their fax message dated 26th august,1998,declined the request of the oil companies,including the appellant,for further extension of charter party beyond 31st august,1998.\nthe said fax message was an internal communication between the oil coordination committee and the oil companies.\nthereafter,in september,1998,the ioc for and on behalf of the oil industry,floated a fresh tender for carriage of petroleum products

under any circumstance.\nshyam divan,learned senior counsel appearing on behalf of the respondent,on the other hand,submitted that notwithstanding the fact that the period fixed originally under the charter party or under the addendum dated 29th june,1998 had come to an end,the subsequent conduct of the parties goes to show that charter of the vessel by the appellant beyond 31st august,1998 continued to be governed by the terms and conditions stipulated in charter party dated 6th may,1997 and,therefore,an arbitration agreement did exist between the parties.\nlearned counsel argued that even otherwise till the vessel was not re-delivered in terms of cls.4 and 23 of charter party dated 6th may,1997,the said agreement could not come to an end.\nit was pointed out that all the obligations of the owners as well as of the charterers during the period the vessel was in use continued to be discharged under the charter party dated 6th may,1997 even after the expiry of the period of the charter party. in support of the proposition that the concurrence of a party can be gathered from his conduct,like continued user of the vessel in the present case,without any objection to respondent s letter dated 4th january,1999,reliance is placed on a decision of this court in the godhra electricity co. ltd.&; anr. vs. the state of gujarat &; anr 1974 indlaw sc 253.\nit was also submitted that the view taken by the high court being a plausible view,interference in exercise of extra-ordinary jurisdiction u/art.136 of the constitution is unwarranted.\n\nISSUE\nwhether the hon ble arbitral tribunal has no jurisdiction to adjudicate upon the dispute between the claimant and the respondent for the period september,1998 to august,1999. in respect of the vessel jag praja for the reasons stated in para 1 of the written statement.\nwhether there is any common practice that if the vessel is not re-delivered at the end of the period mentioned in the time charter the vessel would be governed by the charter party under which originally it was chartered.\nwhether the time charter party dated 6th. may,1997 came to an end by efflux of time on 30th august,1998.\nthe short question for determination is whether on the expiry of the extended period of charter hire on 31st august,1998,charter party dated 6th may,1997 came to an end and the arbitration agreement between the parties perished with it.\n\nANALYSIS\nthat neither the arbitral tribunal nor the high court have gone into the question whether the claim made by the respondent would otherwise fall within the ambit of the arbitration clause in the charter party or not.\nwhat is in dispute is whether the arbitration agreement between the parties had got extinguished after 31st august,1998,i.e.the date of expiry of the extended period of the charter party.\nit is,no doubt,true that the general rule is that an offer is not accepted by mere silence on the part of the offerree,yet it does not mean that an acceptance always has to be given in so many words.\nunder certain circumstances,offerree s silence,coupled with his conduct,which takes the form of a positive act,may constitute an acceptance an agreement sub silentio.\ntherefore,the terms of a contract between the parties can be proved not only by their words but also by their conduct.\nin our view,the principle of sub silentio is clearly attracted in the present case.\nthere was no response by the appellant to respondent s letter dated 4th january,1999 though it appears that vide their letter of even date,the appellant did suggest to the respondent that as a token of formal agreement the said letter may be jointly signed by the charterers and the vessel owners.\nadmittedly,no such agreement was signed between the

the general consumer public.\nthe right of the citizen to obtain essential articles at fair prices and the duty of the state to so provide them are transformed into the power of the state to fix

27, 1962 was issued under section 4 of the land acquisition act 1894 for acquiring 51.79 acres of land situated in the state of ahmedpur.\non the next day another notification was issued under section 6 of the land acquisition act on november 28, 1962 and in view of the emergency action under section 17 was taken for obtaining possession of the land with a view to its development.\nthe lands which were acquired belonged to several land holders including moti ram and p.w. 12 kewal chand.\nthe collector gave his award on 26-2-63 in respect of these lands, which actually measured 49.47 acres, at rs. 1350 per acre amounting to rs. 66,784.50 np.\napart from this amount compensation was also awarded for standing crop amounting to rs. 11,073.13 np.\nthe case of the prosecution initially was that after the land so acquired with the standing crop was taken possession of by the appellant.\nhe sold the crop to moti ram and kewal chand for rs. 2500 and facilitated the cutting and taking away of the crop by postponing the handing over of the possession to the contractor.\na chargesheet was filed against the appellant under section 5 (1) (c) and 5 (1) (d) read with 5 (2) of the prevention of

tile possession of the land 'was in fact delivered to telu ram, contractor on 10-1-1963; that the said contractor had admitted 'that possession of the entire land was received by him; that he carried on the construction work in extending the aerodrome; that 200/250 donkeys were also used for doing the work by reason of which the crop was damaged before tehsildar had put the appellant in possession

that the facts should be referred to in the sanction itself, nonetheless if they do not appear on the face of it, the prosecution must establish aliunde by evidence that those facts were placed before

offence under section 3 of tada had been committed by the accused-appellants in the established facts and circumstances of this case.\nmerely because the deceased and the two injured witnesses belong to wadar community,no inference could be drawn that the attack by the appellants on them was intended to strike terror in a section of the society,namely,the wadar community.\nappellants no.1 (a-5),2 (a-8),3 (a-9) and. 5 (a-11) had alongwith the deceased accused a-1 and some others,about whose identity there has been some doubt,formed an unlawful assembly and in furtherance of the common object of

pw4 informed bd (pw2), the unfortunate father of s, that dead body of a girl was lying near mohalla basera on the outskirts of village kotputli.\nthe dead body was sent for post-mortem examination which was performed at 9.30 a.m., on the same day, by a medical board of three doctors.\nit was found that the victim was brutally ravished and thereafter killed.\naccording to the medical opinion the probable cause of death of s was shock produced due to vaginal trauma and rupture of post- fornix along with asphyxia due to ligature around the neck.\nthe forensic science laboratory confirmed presence of group-b blood on the clothes of deceased.\nthe clothes of the accused recovered were sent to forensic science laboratory. according to report human semen was detected on underwear and human blood of group 'b' was detected on the underwear.\nthe accused was arrested on 3.4.1991 on suspicion.\non 4.4.1991, he was medically examined.\nthere was no injury on his private parts or on any other part of body.\nthe clothes on his person did not have any blood or seminal stains.\nhe was a grown up male of 21 years and capable of performing sexual intercourse.\non 5.4.1991, he gave an information exbt. p/23 and in confirmation of the information led the police to a dry well wherefrom an underwear and baniyan wrapped in a newspaper dated 18.3.1991 were recovered.\nthe clothes so recovered were sent to forensic science laboratory.\naccording to report exbt. p/27 human semen was detected on underwear.\naccording to report exbt. p/30 of forensic science laboratory human blood of group 'b' was detected on the underwear.\nthe accused-appellant has been held guilty of offences punishable under section 302 and section 376(2)(f) of indian penal code.\nwhile the learned additional sessions judge made a reference to the high court for confirmation of death sentence under section 366 cr. p.c., the appellant preferred an appeal putting in issue his conviction and sentence.\n\nARGUMENT\ntherein a charge under sections 376 and 302  ipc  was sought to be substantiated on circumstantial evidence.\none of the circumstantial evidence relied on was that a human blood stain of 'b' group was found on the accused's pant which blood group was also of the deceased.\nanother circumstantial evidence relied on was that a stain of semen was found on the under-pant of the accused.\nas regards the dried stain of semen on the appellant's under-pant, the court observed that the accused was a grown-up man of 30 years and no compelling inference could arise that the stain was caused during the course of the sexual assault committed by him on the victim girl.\nin the present case the age of the accused was about 21 years at the time of the incident.\non his arrest he was subjected to medical examination and found to be a potent and capable person.\npresence of semen stain on underwear, assuming that the underwear belonged to the accused though there is no evidence adduced in this regard, is not by itself an incriminating piece of evidence connecting the accused with the crime in question.\n\nISSUE\nwe would proceed to examine each of the pieces of incriminating circumstantial evidence so as to find out if each one of the circumstantial evidence is proved individually and whether collectively it forges such a chain of incriminating circumstances as would

talk of the town, if called by police and interrogated as a suspect, would be scared and be apprehensive of the likelihood of his being implicated in the crime.\nthe accused has not stated during his

presence at another place.\ndenial by an accused of an assertion made by his employer that the accused was on leave of absence from duty on the date of offence does not, by any stretch of reasoning or

{"text": "FACTS\nthree civil appeals, stemming from three revision petitions to the high court of orissa under the orissa estates abolition act, 1951.\nthe high court, after deciding various issues, remanded the cases to the compensation officer under the act, after over-ruling most of the contentions pressed before it by the appellant.\nshri achutananda purohit, appellant, was the intermediary in respect of vast forests and other lands comprised in the estate of jujumura in the district of sambalpur.\nthe appellant has received around rs. 3,00,000/- but much more, according to him, is due.\n\nARGUMENT\nfor certain reasons the appellant could not derive actual income from the forests taken over by the state from him and therefore there was no income-tax payable on any agricultural income from these forests.\nin arriving at the next income the deduction of income-tax is not permissible.\n\nISSUE\nthe estate vested in the state on april 1, 1960 by force of the act and the crucial question consequentially turns on the quantum of compensation awardable under chapter v of the orissa estates abolition act, 1951.\nthe meat of the matter, the primary question agitated in the appeal, lopping off the fringe issues of lesser import, consists in the statutory methodology and functionaries prescribed by the act for quantifying the compensation and the compliance therewith by the statutory machinery in the case of the appellant.\n\nANALYSIS\nthe compensation officer is charged with fixing the quantum in the prescribed manner.\na compensation assessment roll containing the gross asset and net income of each estate, together with the compensation payable in respect of such estate, has to be prepared by him.\nthe dynamic rule of law, with a social mission, makes a meaningful distinction between rights steeped in the old system and compensation for deprivation of those interests, on the one hand, and the ordinary commercial transactions or regulation of rights untinged by social transformation urges, on the other.\nthis gives rationality to the seeming disparity.\nmoreover, the high court has rightly pointed out that the validity of s. 37(3) of the act which fixes a small rate of interest on the compensation amount has been upheld by the supreme court in gajapati narayan's case.\nart. 31(3) read with art. 31(2) bars any challenge to the amount of compensation on acquisition by the state subject to compliance with the prescriptions in the said sub-articles, on the ground that the amount so fixed or determined is not adequate.\npresidential assent has been accorded to this state act and so the ban operates.\nmoreover, art. 31a repels the applicability of arts. 14, 19 and 31 to the acquisition by the state of any estate or of any rights therein etc.\nin the case of forests it is the assumed income and not the actual income that forms the basis of calculation of compensation.\non the other hand, statutory compensation is provided for on the formula of assumed income in the previous year.\nsimilarly, an assumed income- tax also has to be worked out and deducted.\nthe statutory scheme of compensation for forest lands consists of machinery for assessment of the net income which is multiplied on a sliding scale and the method of challenge to the determination by the aggrieved owner of state.\nso the first step is for the government to appoint forest officers from out of d.f.os. in the forest department, for the purposes of the act.\nthose officers ascertain the income from the forest concerned and the figure so fixed is subject to the approval of the c.c.f. (chief conservator of forests).\nthe power to approve implies the power to disapprove or modify but not to report or arrive at an income de hors the forest officer's report altogether.\nindeed, there was a fundamental difference in the basis adopted by the forest officer and the chief conservator in the matter of assessing the income of the forests in question.\nit is astonishing that anyone should urge, as the appellant did, that the date of vesting is the last date by which the calculation of compensation should have", "doc_id": "8ee8cde6-6135-4384-90d9-326df8ffcfda", "embedding": null,

disposing of the proceedings but also in not being cantankerous in awarding and disbursing the balance compensation.\n\nSTATUTE\ns. 24 of the orissa estates abolition act, 1951 stipulates that the compensation shall be determined for the estate as a whole and not separately for each of the shares therein.\ns. 26 of the orissa estates abolition act, 1951 has great relevance as it lays down the method of arriving at the gross asset and s. 27 has like significance as it focuses on the manner in which the net income from an estate shall be computed by deducting certain items from the gross asset of the estate.\ns. 28 of the orissa estates abolition act, 1951 states how the amount of compensation is to be determined and the methodology of payment.\nthe act also provides for appeal, second appeal and revision, the last being to the high court and the earlier ones being to the collector and a board constituted under s. 22 of the orissa estates abolition act, 1951.\nthe rule-making power is vested in the government under s. 47 of the orissa estates abolition act, 1951 and there is a routine 'removal of difficulties' clause contained in s. of the orissa estates abolition act,

the offences of conspiracy and misappropriation.\nin the first place according to the high court, joint trial of two or more persons in respect of different offences committed by each of them is illegal and that here as they were charged with having committed offences under s. 120-b, s. 409, s. 477-a and s. 476/467, i.p.c. they could not be tried jointly.\n\nARGUMENT\nthe points which he urged are briefly these:\n(1) that there was a misjoinder of charges and persons in that the various provisions of s. 239 were clubbed together and an omnibus charge of conspiracy was framed which on its face was one likely to embarrass the respondents and make their task of defending themselves difficult.\n(2) the procedure adopted in the investigation and committal stages was irregular.\n(3) irrelevant evidence was introduced and some evidence was introduced in a manner not authorised by the evidence act.\n(4) that the court abused its powers under s.342, cr. p.c. while conducting the examination of the respondents.\n(5) the evidence of the approver was inadmissible because the pardon granted to him was illegal, that, in any case, it is unreliable, was so found even by the sessions judge and must, therefore, be rejected.\nif the evidence of the approver is left out the remaining evidence would be inadequate to sustain the prosecution case.\nas many as 2, 000 documents were \"dumped\" by the prosecution in this case out of which 1600 documents were not sought to be proved by it.\nfurther, 64 documents were missing from the records when they came to the high court and that this has caused serious prejudice to the respondent.\n\nISSUE\nthe first question for consideration is whether there was a misjoinder of parties and of persons.\n\nANALYSIS\ns. 120 b provides that whoever is a party to a criminal conspiracy to commit an offence punishable with death, imprisonment for life or rigorous imprisonment for a term of two years or upwards shall be punishable in the same manner as if he has abetted such offence unless there was an express provision in the code for the punishment of such conspiracy.\nthe first", "doc_id":

have been entered into by the two respondents, k. v. ramana, the approver, and others \"known and unknown\" to commit criminal breach of trust of the funds of vesco and, in order to screen its detection, to falsify the accounts of vesco and to use forged documents as genuine.\non the face of it this is a valid charge.\nbut certain objections have been taken to it with which the court will deal at the appropriate place.\nthe second charge is for an offence of criminal breach of trust punishable under s. 409 and the accusation therein is that the two respondents along with ramana, misappropriated 69 items aggregating to a little over rs. 3, 20, 000/-.\nit is clear from the charge that some of the amounts were misappropriated between april, 1947 and march, 1950, some between april, 1947 and march, 1949, some between april, 1947 and march, 1951 and quite a large number between september, 1947 and march, 1950 and a still large number between april, 1951 and march, 1952.\nit is thus apparent that offences committed within a space of 12 months were tried along with offences committed beyond that period.\nunless, therefore, the provisions of s. 239 are applicable it would follow that there was a misjoinder of charges.\nthe third charge is that the two respondents, along with the approver ramana made false entries on seven different dates in the account books between september 19, 1947 and march 18, 1952 and thus committed an offence under s. 477-a, i.p.c.\nthe fourth charge is that the two respondents, along with the approver ramana forged six documents on different dates between march 28, 1949 and november 12, 1951 and thus committed an offence under s. 471 read with s. 467, i.p.c.\nin coming to the conclusion that the provisions of various clauses of s. 239 cannot be applied cumulatively the high court has relied upon the decision in re: vankavalapati gopala rao 1956 air(andhra) 21 ).\nthere the learned judges have held that these clauses are mutually exclusive and they cannot be simultaneously applied and to construe them as supplementing each other would be enlarging the scope of the exceptions.\neach clause is an exception to the general rule enacted in s. 233, cr. p.c.\nif such a combination is permissible, all persons accused of offences described in cls. (a) to (g) can be tried together in one case which certainly involves a bewildering multiplicity of charges and which would obviously set at naught the salutary principle contained in s. 233.\ns 236 is a special provision available in case of doubt and is neither subject to the limitations prescribed by s. 233 nor those of the other preceding provisions.\nnow, if the respondent no. 1 were alone tried upon the second, third and the fourth charges the provisions of s. 235(1) could have been pressed in aid if the allegations were that the offences were so connected together as to form one and the same transaction and the validity of the trial would not have been open to any attack.\nsimilarly if the second respondent were alone tried on the second charge his trial would not have been open to any objection if the allegation were that the offences were so connected together as to form the same transaction.\nhere, however, the court a case where the prosecution alleges that there was additionally a conspiracy to which apart from the two respondents the approver and some other persons were parties and where in both the respondents were tried together.\na conspiracy must be regarded as one transaction and, therefore, a single individual charged with it could be tried with the aid of s. 235(1) for all the acts committed by him in furtherance or in pursuance of the conspiracy without the limitations imposed by s.234(1).\nfor, where all the acts are referable to the same conspiracy their connection with one another is obvious.\nthe only provision in the code which permits", "doc_id": "25ebe840-28d1-41e1-ad08-908aac71d14b", "embedding": null, "doc_hash": "31ec935c434f908a836d10ef17e9bc4d25d431ac8f1259b4874045e1da386ce3", "extra_info": null, "node_info": {"start": 11497, "end": 15494, "_node_type": "1"}, "relationships": {"1": "b02a28d3-ffb1-42a6-937e-04604b4225c7", "2": "894b8136-9b2d-4488-8ede-4d8593ba1221", "3": "c8f79f88-7d1d-4d7c-82bd-b327d87b301e"}}, "__type__": "1"}, "c8f79f88-7d1d-4d7c-82bd-b327d87b301e": {"__data__": {"text": "their connection with one another is obvious.\nthe only provision in the code which permits the joint trial of more than one person is s. 239 and what the court to see is whether under that provision the two respondents could have been jointly tried for the offences with which they were charged.\nlet us, therefore, examine closely the provisions of s. 239.\non the other hand at the end of cl. (f) there is a conjunction 'and'.\nnow, since s. 234(1) cannot be properly read overriding s. 235(1) there is no valid reason for construing it as overriding the provisions of s. 239 either.\ns, 239 must be read at least subject to ss. 234(1) and 235(1) on the ground that if there are certain restrictions with respect to the trial of a single accused there is no reason why those restrictions will disappear if an accused person is tried along with several other persons.\nthus where several persons are accused of more offences than one of the same kind committed by them jointly within a period of 12 months, the number of offences for which they could be tried cannot exceed three.\nin this connection he relied upon the words \"within the meaning of s. 224\" occurring in cl. (c) of s. 239.\nthese words clearly show that cl. (c) of s. 239 is subject to the provisions of s. 234.\nin the court\u2019s opinion the words \"within the meaning of s. 234\" indicate that what was meant by the words offence of the same kind\" \"'persons accused of more offences than one of the same kind not exceeding three in number\"or may have used the words\" person accused of more than one offence of the same kind to the extent permissible under s. 234.\ntherefore, even if the expression \"'same transaction\" alone had been used in s. 235(1) it would have meant a transaction consisting either of a single act or of a series of connected acts.\nthe expression \"same transaction\" occurring in cls. (a), (c) and (d) of s. 239 as well as that occurring in s. 235(1) ought to be given the same meaning according to the normal rule of construction of statutes.\nlooking at the matter in that way, it is pointless to inquire further whether the provisions of s. 239 are subject to those of s. 236(1).\nthe provisions of sub-s. (2) and (3) of s. 235 are enabling provisions and quite plainly can have no overriding effect.\nbut it would be open to the court to resort to those provisions even in the case of a joint trial of several persons permissible under s. 239.s. 236 is also an enabling provision to be availed of in case of doubt and it is meaningless to say that s. 239 is subject to s. 236.\nbearing in mind the fact that the provisions in the \"former part\" of chapter xix are applicable to charges made with the aid of s. 239 only \"so far as may be\" it would not be right to construe s. 239 as being subject to the provisions of ss. 233 to 236.\nit was contended by mr. chari that the expression \"former part\" would apply to the first sub- division of chapter xix which deals with the form and content of the charges and the powers of the court with regard to the absence of charge and alteration of charge.\nthe court could not, however, give the expression such a restricted meaning.\nfor, even in the absence of those words, the earlier provisions could not have been ignored.\nfor, it is a rule of construction that all the provisions of a statute are to be read together and given effect to and that it is, therefore, the duty of the court to construe a statute harmoniously.\nthus, while it is clear that the sections preceding s. 239 have no overriding effect on that section, , the courts are not to ignore them but apply such of them as can be applied without detracting from the provisions of s.239.\nindeed, the very expression 'so far as may be' emphasises the fact that while the earlier provisions have to be borne in mind by the court while applying s. 239 it is not those provisions but the latter which is to have an", "doc_id": "c8f79f88-7d1d-4d7c-82bd-b327d87b301e", "embedding":

an illegal act or an agreement to do an act which is not illegal by illegal means.\ncriminal conspiracy was, however, not an unknown thing before the amendment of the indian penal code in 1913.\nbut what the amendment did was to make that conspiracy itself punishable. the idea was to prevent the commission of crimes by, so to , speak, nipping them in the bud.\nbut it does not follow that where crimes have been committed the liability to punishment already incurred under s. 120-b by having entered into a criminal conspiracy is thereby wiped away.\nno doubt, as already stated, where offences for committing which a conspiracy was entered into have actually been committed it may not, in the particular circumstances of a case, be desirable to charge the offender both with the conspiracy and the offences committed in pursuance of that conspiracy.\nbut that would be a matter ultimately within the discretion of the court before which the trial takes place.\nin so far as the fourth point is concerned, that would have a bearing not on the form of the charge but on the credibility of the evidence bearing on the point of conspiracy.\nthe prosecution be established by reference to s. 34 of the indian evidence act which reads thus as what it does is to make entries in books of account regularly kept in the course of business relevant in all proceedings in a court of law.\nthese entries are, however, not by themselves sufficient to charge any person with liability.\ntherefore, when a sues b for a sum of money it is open to him to put his account books' in evidence provided they are regularly kept in the course of business and show by reference to them that the amount claimed by him is debited against b.\nthe entry though made by a in his own account books, and though it is in his own favour is a piece of evidence which the court may take into consideration for the purpose of determining whether the amount referred to therein was in fact paid by a to b.\nthe entry by itself is of no help to a in his claim against b but it can be considered by the court along with the evidence of a for drawing the conclusion that the amount was paid by a to b.\nto this limited extent entries -in the account books are relevant and can be proved. s. 34 does not go beyond that.\nit says nothing about non-existence of entries in account books.\nthe court, therefore, agree with the high court that the account books of the various concerns to whom payments are said to have been made by the respondents are not by themselves evidence of the fact that no payments were received by them.\nthe decision in queen empress v. grees chunder banerjee ((1884) i. l. r. 10 cal 1024.), upon which reliance is placed by the high court in support of its view is also to that effect. similarly in ram prashad singh v. lakhpati koer ((1902) i. l. r. 30 cal 231, 247).\nlord robertson during the course of the hearing has observed that no inference can be drawn from the absence of any entry relating to any particular matter which observation supports the view taken in queen empress v. girish chander banerjee ( (1884) i.l.r. 10 c.l 1024. ).\nthere is s. ii of the evidence act which provides that facts not otherwise relevant are relevant if they are inconsistent with any fact in issue or relevant fact.\nsome of the facts in issue in this case are whether payments of certain sums of money were made to crompton engineering co., and other firms or authorities.\nabsence of entries in their account books would be inconsistent with the receipt of the accounts and would thus be a relevant fact which can be proved under s. 11.\nthe fact that no payments were received by those firms has been deposed to by persons connected with those firms and whose duty it was to receive and

to a physical or material fact which can be perceived by the senses,and that it does not include a mental fact,now it is fairly settled that the expression \"fact discovered\" includes not only the physical object produced,but also the place from which it is produced and the knowledge of the accused as to this,as noted in pulukuri kottaya's case 1946 indlaw pc 23.\nin rammi alias rameshwar v.state of madhya pradesh (air 1999 sc 3544 1999 indlaw sc 1512) the scope and ambit of section 27 of the evidence act was analysed in great detail and it was concluded in para 12 as follows.\ntrue,such information is admissible in evidence under section 27 of the evidence act,but admissibility alone would not render the evidence,pertaining to the above information,reliable.\nwhile testing the reliability of such evidence the court has to see whether it was voluntarily stated by the accused.\nthe alleged statement made by the accused led to discovery of knife,bloodstained clothes,rope,etc.\nunfortunately,for the prosecution there is no evidence to show that in fact the wearing apparels containing bloodstains belonged to the accused,save and except the alleged confessional statement.\nno witness has spoken that those clothes were worn by the accused at any time far less at or about the time of occurrence.\nit is also to be kept in view that those articles were recovered from the house of p.w.3 and at the initial stage of investigation,p.w.3 himself was one of the suspected person and he was arrested.\ntherefore,the statement of p.w.3 and his mother that those articles were brought by the accused and left in the upstairs room is to be considered with a pinch of salt\nmoreover,there is nothing to indicate that in fact the bloodstained clothes and rope had tallied with the blood grouping of the deceased.\nthe knife did not contain any bloodstain.\ntherefore,the aspect relating to recovery of articles from the house of p.w.3 and his mother cannot be considered as a link to complete the chain of circumstantial evidence.\nthe evidence of p.ws.17,18 and 19 is relevant.\nsince the golden jewellery had been molten and were recovered in the shape of ingots,it would be very hazardous to come to the conclusion that in fact the golden jewellery belonged to the deceased.\nif the accused had killed the deceased and stolen those golden jewellery,there is no reason as to why he had also not taken ear rings from the deceased.\nthe fact that ear rings were on the dead body is admitted by the prosecution.\nthe fact that there had been a statement allegedly made by p.w.1 leading to recovery of a parallel key from the dash board of the car of p.w.1,cannot be lost sight of.\nit is of course true that the prosecution has tried to exonerate p.w.1 by adducing evidence through p.ws.36 and 39 to the effect that immediately after recovery of the dead body,p.w.40 had taken two such keys,thus contradicting the alleged confession of p.w.1.\nhowever,the very suspicious role of p.w.40,who apparently was in possession of at least two keys of the same lock creates suspicion regarding recovery of another key after 5 months.\nlaw is well settled that when the prosecution relies upon circumstantial evidence,all the links in the chain of circumstances must be complete and should be proved through cogent evidence\nwhen the judgment of the high court is analysed in the background of what has been stated by this court as regards circumstantial evidence,the inevitable conclusion is that the impugned judgment of the high court does not suffer from any infirmity to warrant interference.\n\nSTATUTE\nsection 302 ipc, 1860.\n\n", "doc_id": "3d0ae3fb-62c5-40ec-baca-41e0f317e0f3", "embedding": null, "doc_hash":

the appellant made a profit of rs. 11,97,648-11-9.\nit paid 24. 3 per cent dividend on ordinary shares, being the maximum that could be paid under the public companies (limitation of dividend) ordinance of 1948 and also paid to the workers their full share of bonus at annas 4 in a rupee of their basic earnings.\nduring 1949 the selling rates for cloth and yarn were controlled by the government and were approximately 4 per cent. below those obtained in 1948.\nthe basic wages were increased from the 1st december, 1948, by order of the government of uttar pradesh and the total wages paid were therefore higher than those in the previous year.\nthere was moreover indiscipline amongst the workers and production suffered.\nthere was a strike in october and the mills were closed for nearly a month.\nfurther the management were unable to secure cotton which resulted in the curtailment of the working hours.\nas a result of all these circumstances the appellant suffered a huge trading loss.\nthe appellant also paid ex gratia to the workmen bonus at the rate of annas 2 per rupee of their basic earnings making it clear by their notification 7th april, 1950, that the directors had sanctioned the payment at that rate in spite of the appellant having suffered a trading loss for the year, that it was being paid entirely at the discretion of the appellant and was not related to or connected with any contract of employment of any worker.\nthe secretary of the respondent union petitioned to the provincial conciliation officer (textile) that there was more production in 1949 than in 1948, that there was no reason to hold that the profit in 1949 was less than in the previous year and that the rate of bonus was wrongly reduced and asked that bonus for 1949 should also be paid at the rate of annas 4 per rupee.\nthe industrial dispute which thus arose was referred for enquiry and recording of an award to the regional conciliation board (textile), kanpur.\nthe conciliation board by a majority decision repelled the contention of the appellant and awarded the payment of bonus at annas 4 per rupee.\non an appeal taken by the appellant to the industrial court (textiles and hosiery), kanpur, the industrial court accepted the contention of the appellant, allowed the appeal and set aside the award.\nthe respondent thereupon appealed to the labour appellate tribunal which substantially agreed with the industrial court on questions of fact as well as the general position in law but imported considerations of social justice and treating this as a special case \" where social justice would demand that labour should have bonus for the year where for that very year capital had not only a reasonable return but much in excess of that \", allowed the appeal and directed the appellant to pay to the workmen bonus .\nthe appellant filed this appeal against that decision after obtaining special leave from this court.\n\nARGUMENT\n\"social justice connotes the balance of adjustments of the various interests concerned in the social and economic structure of the state, in order to promote harmony upon an ethical and economic basis\" and he stated that there were three parties concerned here, viz. the employers, the labour and the state itself, and the conception of social justice had to be worked out in this context.\nwithout embarking upon a discussion as to the exact connotation of the expression \"social justice\" we may only observe that the concept of social justice does not emanate from the fanciful notions of any particular adjudicator but must be founded on a more solid foundation.\n\nISSUE\nthe question which  arises for our consideration is mainly whether the workers are entitled to the payment of a bonus in spite of the employer having worked at a loss during the year and incidentally whether the workers have any right, title or interest in the reserves and the undistributed profits of the previous years.\n\nANALYSIS\nthe primary meaning of the word \" bonus \"", "doc_id": "817574f2-0113-4621-a8c8-e02d23d1b219", "embedding": null, "doc_hash":

meaning of the word \" bonus \" imports the conception of a boon, a gift or a gratuity otherwise described as an ex gratia payment.\nthe word 'bonus' has however acquired a secondary meaning in the sphere of industrial relations. it is classified amongst the methods of wage payment.\nin sutton v. attorney-general , (1923) 39 t.l.r. 294, 297; where \"the term 'bonus' may of course be properly used to describe payments made of grace and not as of right.\nbut it nevertheless may also include, as here, payments made because legally due but which the parties contemplate will not continue indefinitely\" .\nthere are however two conditions which have to be satisfied before a demand for bonus can be justified and they are, (1) when wages fall short of the living standard and (2) the industry makes huge profits part of which are due to the contribution which the workmen make in increasing production.\nthe demand for bonus becomes an industrial claim when either or both these conditions are satisfied.\nthe surplus that remained after meeting the aforesaid deductions would be available for distribution as bonus.\nthe claim for bonus can be made by the employees only if as a result of the joint contribution of capital and labour the industrial concern has earned profits.\nif in any particular year the working of the industrial concern has resulted in loss there is no basis nor justification for a demand for bonus.\nthe dividends can only be paid out of profits and unless and until profits are made no occasion or question can also arise for distribution of any sum as bonus amongst the employees.\nthis was also the basis of the demand of the respondent in the case before us, its case being that the appellant had reaped substantial profits during 1949.\non the accounts of each year being made up and the profits of the industrial concern being ascertained the workers during the particular year have their demand for bonus fully satisfied out of the surplus profits and the balance of profits is allocated and carried over in the accounts.\nno further claimed payment of bonus out of those reserves or undistributed profits can therefore survive.\nit is also significant to note that even while importing considerations of social justice the labour appellate tribunal was oblivious of the fact that it was by their own acts of indiscipline and strike that the workers of the appellant company themselves contributed, to the trading losses incurred by the appellant and it hardly lay in their mouth then to contend that they were none the less entitled to a payment of bonus commensurate with the dividend paid to the shareholders out of the undistributed profits of the previous years.\nthe labour appellate tribunal also overlooked the fact that but for the public companies (limitation of dividend) ordinance of 1948 the whole of the profits of 1948 could have been distributed after paying the workers bonus in that year of four annas in the rupee.\nin textile mills, m. p. their workmen, (1952) 2 l.l.j. 625; and famous cine laboratory v. their workmen, (1953) 1 l.l.j. 466; and in the latter case it deprecated the idea of adjudicators importing considerations of social justice which were not comprised in that formula :- \"and what is social justice ? social justice is not the fancy of any individual adjudicator; if it were so then ideas of social justice might vary from adjudicator to adjudicator over all parts of india. in our full bench decision (see 1950, 2 l.l.j. 1247), we carefully considered the question of social justice in relation to bonus, and there we equated the rights and liabilities of employers and workmen with a view to achieving a just formula for the computation of bonus. that full bench decision stands, and this tribunal and all other tribunals are bound by it.\n\n", "doc_id": "9eaa0720-204c-41d1-96f5-ae7fee0c939f", "embedding": null, "doc_hash":

nature and also of the fact that due to the said conviction and sentence he lost his job,leniency may be shown and sentence be reduced to the period already undergone.\nhe fairly admitted that out of the maximum period of one year,the appellant had served only 52 days in prison.\nwith this factual position,let us consider whether the request of the learned senior counsel for the appellant is to be accepted and sentence be reduced to the period already undergone.\ninasmuch as the incident had occurred on 14.11.1997 and the trial court has convicted him on 19.03.2001 which was affirmed by the high court on 03.10.2007,at this juncture,i.e.,after a gap of 14 years,there is no need to retain the same sentence and the court is not justified in directing the appellant to serve the remaining period after such a long time.\nby drawing our attention to art.142 of the constitution of india,learned senior counsel for the appellant vehemently submitted that in order to do complete justice,this court has ample power to reduce the sentence even to the extent of period already undergone or any other order which would be beneficial to the parties approaching this court.\n\nISSUE\nnotice only on

of the minimum sentence prescribed u/ss.7 and 13 of the act,we are of the view that though long delay may be a ground for reduction of sentence in other cases,the same may not be applicable to the case on hand when the statute prescribes minimum sentence.\nabout the request based on delay that the appellant has lost his job,undergone the ordeal all along etc.\na lenient view be taken in this

do complete justice,if exercise of such jurisdiction is not be contrary to any express provision of law.\nthough the jurisdiction of this court,u/art.142 of the constitution of india is not in

code and this court,u/art.142 of the constitution,would not ordinarily direct quashing of a case involving crime against the society particularly,when both the trial court as also the high court have found that the charge leveled against the appellant under the act has been made out and proved by the prosecution by placing acceptable evidence.\nthe orders do not disclose any factual details and the relevant provisions under which the accused was charged/convicted and minimum sentence,if any,as available in the act as well as the period already undergone.\nfrom the analysis of the above decisions and the concerned provisions with which we are concerned,the following principles emerge:\na) when the court issues notice confining to particular aspect/sentence,arguments will be heard only to that extent unless some extraordinary circumstance/material is shown to the court for arguing the matter on all aspects.\nb) long delay in disposal of appeal or any other factor may not be a ground for reduction of sentence,particularly,when the statute prescribes minimum sentence.in other cases where no such minimum sentence is prescribed,it is open to the court to consider the delay and its effect and the ultimate decision. c) in a case of corruption by public servant,quantum of amount is immaterial.ultimately it depends upon the conduct of the delinquent and the proof regarding demand and acceptance established by the prosecution.\nd) merely because the delinquent lost his job due to conviction under the act may not be a mitigating circumstance for reduction of sentence,particularly,when the statute prescribes minimum sentence.\ne) though art.142 of the constitution gives wider power to this court,waiver of certain period as prescribed in the statute imposing lesser sentence than the minimum prescribed is not permissible.\nf) an order,which this court can make in order to do complete justice between the parties,must not only be consistent with the fundamental rights guaranteed by the constitution,but also it cannot even be inconsistent with the substantive provisions of the relevant statute.\ng) in exercise of the power u/art.142 of the

remedies should and normally will be applied;\nand (b) where there is a contract between the litigants. in such a case the express or implied terms of the agreement should normally govern the matter.\nthus,where a special method of resolving disputes (such as arbitration or resolution by private or domestic tribunals) has been agreed by the parties (expressly or by necessary implication),that regime,and not judicial review,will normally govern the dispute.\nthe high court has relied very strongly on the decision of a learned single judge in t.gattaiahs case wherein it was stated that a writ may lie under article 226 of the constitution against a company incorporated under the companies act,1956 as it is permissible to issue a writ against any person.\nin parimal chandra rahas case the court held that when the duty had been enjoined on the appellant to provide and maintain a canteen facility under the factories act it becomes the obligation of the appellant to establish a canteen and that is what the appellant had done.therefore,when that work is got done through somebody else by providing the necessary infrastructure and other facilities,when the personnel did not change though the contractors changed from time to time,he held that they become employees of the appellant\nin anadi muktas case this court examined the various aspects and the distinction between an authority and a person and after analysis of the decisions referred in that regard came to the conclusion that it is only in the circumstances when the authority or the person performs a public function or discharges a public duty article 226 of the constitution can be invoked.\nin the present case,the appellant is engaged in the manufacture and sale of cigarettes.\nmanufacture and sale of cigarettes will not involve any public function.\nincidental to that activity there is an obligation under section 46 of the act to set up a canteen when the establishment has more than 250 workmen.\nthat means,it is a condition of service in relation to a workman providing better facilities to workmen to discharge their duties properly and maintain their own health or welfare.\nthe findings recorded by the learned single judge on examination of the facts available is that there had been a canteen within the premises of the appellant up to the year 1982 and it is only from 1982 onwards the management of the canteen has been entrusted to a private contractor; that even after change of the contractor,the canteen workers have continued to be the same irrespective of the change in the contractors from time to time; that wages were paid to the workmen in the canteen by the management through the contractor; that the appellant has provided the accommodation,furniture,fuel,electricity,utensils,etc. that the management exercises control over the standard in quality,quantity and the rate of the food items supplied to the workmen for whose benefit the canteen is established.\nthus,these circumstances clearly indicate that the appellant has a complete control over the activities in respect of the canteen and the contractor has absolutely no discretion either in regard to the menu,quality and quantity of the food items much less the rate at which the same are supplied to the workmen.\nwhen the management of the appellant exercises such a complete control,the canteen shall be deemed to be run by the management itself.\nthe appellant in any manner cannot controvert these facts.\nthere is no material on record to show that the canteen is located in such an area where it would be hazardous to have a fire,furnace,source of heat or light to cook food.\n\nSTATUTE\nthe canteen is provided in the factory premises of the appellant pursuant to section 46 of the factories act,1948,which obliges a factory employing more than 250 workmen to provide such a canteen.\n\n", "doc_id": "fabf707e-090c-428d-bdb4-1f062b989444", "embedding":

had been made by a competent authority or at least some steps have been taken in that behalf,the principles of natural justice are required to be complied with.\nin kumari shrilekha vidyarthi 1990 indlaw sc 463 (supra), it was held that the wide sweep of art.14 undoubtedly takes within its fold the impugned circular issued by the state of u.p.in exercise of its executive power,irrespective of the precise nature of appointment of the government counsel in the districts and the other rights,contractual or statutory,which the appointees may have.\nit is for this reason that we base our decision on the ground that independent of any statutory right,available to the appointees,and assuming for the purpose of this case that the rights flow only from the contract of appointment,the impugned circular,issued in exercise of the executive power of the state,must satisfy art.14 of the constitution and if it is shown to be arbitrary,it must be struck down.\nhowever,we have referred to certain provisions relating to initial appointment,termination or renewal of tenure to indicate that the action is controlled at least by settled guidelines,followed by the state of u.p.,for a long time.\nthis too is relevant for deciding the question of arbitrariness alleged in the present case.\nin m.c.mehta v.union of india and others [(1999) 6 scc 237  1999 indlaw sc 1396],this court developed the \"useless formality\" theory stating: \"more recently lord bingham has deprecated the useless formality theory in r.v.chief constable of the thames valley police forces,ex p cotton by giving six reasons.\na detailed and emphatic criticism of the useless formality theory has been made much earlier in natural justice,substance or shadow by prof.d.h.clark of canada (1975 pl,27 63) contending that malloch and glynn were wrongly decided.foulkes,craig  and others say that the court cannot prejudge what is to be decided by the decision-making authority.de smith says courts have not yet committed themselves to any one view though discretion is always with the court.\nwade says that while futile writs may not be issued,a distinction has to be made according to the nature of the decision.\nthus,in relation to cases other than those relating to admitted or indisputable facts,there is a considerable divergence of opinion whether the applicant can be compelled to prove that the outcome will be in his favour or he has to prove a case of substance or if he can prove a real likelihood of success or if he is entitled to relief even if there is some remote chance of success.\nin kendriya vidyalaya sangathan 2002 indlaw sc 287 (supra),it was held: \"it is clear that if after the termination of services of the said dr.k.c.rakesh,the orders of appointment are issued,such orders

collector to held an inquiry contemplated by s.37(2) of the code.\n\nISSUE\nthe main question raised in this appeal by special leave at the instance of state,of gujarat and the collector against the gujarat high court's judgment allowing the writ petition of the respondent is whether once the competent authority under s.2(4) (i) of the bombay merged territories and areas (jagirs abolition. act,1953  declares that a particular jagir is a proprietary one.\nthe general question is whether once the competent authority under s.2 (4) (i) of the act declares that the particular jagir is a proprietary one a further inquiry under s.37(2) of the land revenue code with a view to determining whether the jagirdar had rights to mines and mineral products in such jagir subsisting on the appointed date is competent.\nthe other specific question is whether in the facts of the case and having regard to the nature of evidence considered and the specific finding made by the competent authority while determining the question under s.2(4. i),the further inquiry initiated by the collector under s.37(2) was misconceived and uncalled for.\n\nANALYSIS\ndealing with the first question,it is clear that the answer thereto depends upon the true scope and ambit of the inquiry under s.2 (4) (i) of the act and to determine the same it will be necessary to consider the scheme and object of the act and.in particular the purpose of the said inquiry.\nin the first place the,preamble and s.3 of the act clearly show that the object of the enactment is to abolish jagirs of all kinds in the merged territories and merged areas in the state of bombay and to convert all jagir villages into unalienated villages liable to the payment of land revenue in accordance with the provisions of the bombay land revenue code.\nsecondly,compensation is made payable under s.11 of the act to jagirdars whose jagirs and other incidental rights have been extinguished but it will be pertinent to note that no provision has been made for payment of compensation in respect of rights to mines and mineral products in a jagir village,obviously because if by the grant in question the jagirdar has not been given any rights to mines and mineral products no compensation would be payable and if there be a grant of mines and mineral products the same have been saved \"to the jagirdar under s.10 of the act.\nthirdly,the quantum of compensation payable for abolition of jagir and extinguishment of his other rights depends upon what kind of jagir has been abolished,whether it is proprietary or non-proprietary; in other words it is clear that the inquiry into the nature of the jagir under s.2 (4) (i) is for the purpose of determining the quantum of compensation payable to a jagirdar inasmuch as in the case of.a non-proprietary jagir the jagirdar is entitled to compensation at the rate of three times the amount of land revenue received by or due to him as an incident of jagir during the five years immediately before the appointed date under s.11 (1),while in the case of a proprietary jagir in respect of land held by a permanent holder the jagirdar is entitled to compensation equivalent to three multiples of the assessment fixed for such land; s.11(3) provides for compensation and computation thereof to a jagirdar having any right or interest in any property referred to in s.8.in such an inquiry ordinarily no determination of any rights of the jagirdar to mines or mineral products in a jagir village will be undertaken for' no compensation is payable in respect of any rights to mines and mineral products in a jagir village.\nthere is yet one more aspect emerging from the definition of the expression \"proprietary jagir\" which leads to the same inference.\n\"proprietary jagir\" has been defined in s.2(xviii) to mean", "doc_id": "10f79d67-491c-4dda-859f-3345436873fd", "embedding": null, "doc_hash":

under the terms of a grant or agreement is entitled to some rights or interest in the soil other than mines or mineral products.\nit is true that prima facie the owner of the surface of the land would be entitled to everything beneath the land and ordinarily mines and mineral products would pass with the right to the surface but this would be so in the absence of any reservations made in the grant; if there be reservations or qualifications in regard to mines or mineral products,in the grant,then these would not pass.\nin other words,before the collector can initiate an inquiry under that provision,either the state or the individual must put forward a claim to a property or any right in or over the property and it is such claim that is to be inquired into by the collector whose decision,subject to a civil suit filed within one year,is rendered final.\nit is thus clear that by these two applications the respondent had not put forward any claim as such to excavating gravel and

position,there was no occasion for the collector to initiate the inquiry under s.37(2) of the code-in fact,he had no jurisdiction to do so,the condition precedent not being satisfied. .\nbesides,while determining the proprietary nature of the grant under s.2(4)(1) of the act the competent authority had,on evidence led before it,alluded among others to the respondent's right to excavate and sell gravel and stones and enjoyment thereof by the respondent.\nin these circumstances it would be fair and proper that the respondent is not subjected to a further inquiry under.s.37(2) of the code.\n\nSTATUTE\ns.2 of the bombay merged territories and areas (jagirs abolition act,1953)  contains the definitions of various expressions some of which are material.\nas a consequence of the,abolition of jagirs under s.3 all jagir villages became unalienated villages and,therefore,under s.4 it has been provided that all jagir villages shall be liable to the payment of land revenue in accordance with the provisions of the code.\ns.5 and 6 make provision as to what persons,upon abolition of jagirs and conversion of jagir land into unalienated land would be occupants,who shall be primarily liable to the state government for payment of land revenue.\ns.10 contains an express saving provision relating to rights to mines and mineral products.\ns.11 (1)  of the bombay merged territories and areas (jagirs abolition act,1953)  provides for the quantum of compensation payable to a non-proprietary jagirdar on account of abolition of his jagir and extinguishment of his rights,while s.11(2) makes similar provision for quantum of compensation to a proprietary jagirdar on account of the abolition of 'his jagir and extinguishment of his rights.\n\n", "doc_id":

modified and excess area was granted to the appellant on payment of rs.31,360/-,which appellant had paid on 17.5.1982 in government treasury and thereby the deputy collector and assistant settlement

displaced person who migrated from pakistan to india during the period of partition and the appellant's family while in pakistan was having agricultural land over there admeasuring 4 acres 10 gunthas.after migration,the family took shelter at refugee camp of pimpri,pune in maharashtra.\nin view of enactment of displaced persons (compensation and rehabilitation) act,1954 by the union of

of the bombay high court in the case of sambappa vs.state of maharashtra [(2002) scc on line,bombay 1222],learned counsel submitted that when the sub-divisional officer,additional collector and additional commissioner had concurrently recorded finding in favour of the appellant by observing that the revenue record is not in consonance with the factual aspect and they have directed to correct the revenue entries,in such a case,the second revisional authority exceeded its jurisdiction in entertaining the said application and interfering with the finding of fact.\nsection 257 makes it clear that a revisional authority has to consider only the legality and propriety of the decision.\nlearned counsel referring the revisional jurisdiction of the high court under section 115 of the code of civil procedure tried to impress us that when the power of revision is given to the district judge,then the high court cannot entertain second revision petition under section 115 of the code.\n\nISSUE\nwhether a second revision under section 257 is maintainable and that whether the state government exceeds its jurisdiction in entertaining the second revision?\n\nANALYSIS\nthe state government makes appointment of the revenue officers including the commissioner and the chief controlling authorities in the revenue matters.\nsection 5 makes it clear that the chief controlling authority in all matters connected with the land revenue in his division shall vest with the commissioner,subject to superintendence,directions and control of the state government.\nsection 11 provides that all revenue officers shall be subordinate to the state government.\nit is,therefore,clear that in revenue matters the state government is the supreme revenue authority.\nthe power of revision exercised by any revenue officer including the commissioner is a proceeding by a subordinate officer and the state government can satisfy itself as to the legality and propriety of any decision including the order passed in revision by the revenue officers.\nstate government itself appoints the revenue officers including the commissioner under the scheme of the code and all revenue officers are subordinate to the state government as per section 11 of the act,and even the chief controlling authority in all matters connected with the land revenue in his division is vested with the commissioner,they are subject to the superintendence,direction and control of the state government as provided under section 5 of the code.\nthe state government's power to call for and examine the record and proceedings of subordinate officers is saved.\nthe revisional powers are not only exercisable by the state government but also by certain other revenue officers.\nthere is nothing in the code to suggest that if these revisional powers are exercised by a revenue officer who has jurisdiction,it cannot be further exercised by a superior revenue officer or by the state government.\nin the case of ishwar singh v. state of rajasthan and others,(2005) 2 scc 334 under the rajasthan cooperative societies act,1965, this court held:- sub-section (2) of section 124 provides that if the

expression adopted in the copyrighted work.\nif the defendant's work is nothing but a literal imitation of the copyrighted work with some variations here and there it would amount to violation of the copyright.\nin other words,in order to be actionable the copy must be a substantial and material one which at once leads to the conclusion that the defendant is guilty of an act of piracy.\n3.one of the surest and the safest test to determine whether or not there has been a violation of copyright is to see if the reader,spectator or the viewer after having read or seen both the works is clearly of the opinion and gets an unmistakable impression that the subsequent work appears to be a copy of the original.\n4.where the theme is the same but is presented and treated differently so that the subsequent work becomes a completely new work,no question of violation of copyright arises.\n5.where however apart from the similarities appearing in the two works there are also material and broad dissimilarities which negative the intention to copy the original and the coincidences appearing in the two works are clearly incidental no infringement of the copyright comes into existence.\n6.as a violation of copyright amounts to an act of piracy it must be proved by clear and cogent evidence after applying the various tests laid down by the case-law discussed above.\n7.where however the

applications before the madras high court,inter alia,under sections 46 and 56 of the trade and merchandise marks act,1958.\nthe first respondent prayed for the removal/rectification of the entry in the register of trade mark in respect of trade mark no.475269 in class 16 while in the other two applications being,the first respondent prayed for removal/rectification of trade mark no.475267 in class 9 and trade mark no.484837 in class 7 respectively.\n\nARGUMENT\nassailing the finding of the ipab as regards non-use by the appellant during the relevant period,learned counsel for the appellant argued that the said finding was erroneous on legal as well as factual premise.\nhe contended that the ipab erred in holding that software was a 'service' and the subject registrations were in relation to goods without considering the wide definition of 'goods' provided under section 2(g) of the 1958 act.\nmr.akhil sibal argued that the ipab committed grave error in relying upon the provisions of the 1999 act and the trade marks rules,2002 when these provisions were not applicable as the applications were filed under the 1958 act.\nthe ipab sought to rely upon 'computer programming' which is a 'service' enumerated in class 42,without considering the distinction between a 'computer programme' and 'computer programming' and without noticing the entry 'computer' under class 9 which falls within 'goods'.\nlearned counsel would submit that in examining the question of non-use under", "doc_id": "6a752b67-ee10-4fd0-a0ed-d60061edb080", "embedding": null, "doc_hash":

examining the question of non-use under section 46(1)(b),the ipab failed to consider that the requisite use must be 'in relation to goods' under registration,which is extensively defined under section 2(2)(b) of the 1958 act.\nthe plea of 'aggrieved person' is a new plea and raised substantially for the first time before this court.\nhe argued that the appellant has not taken the plea of the first respondent not being a 'person aggrieved' with respect to filing of the applications for rectification before the ipab; merely urging the plea that the first respondent has no locus standi in the written submissions before the ipab is not sufficient.\nlearned counsel would submit that the appellant has,for the first time,argued before this court that the first respondent is not a person aggrieved and/or not capable of maintaining the rectification proceedings with respect to each and every good for which the appellant has been registered since the first respondent has not been registered for all the goods.\n\nISSUE\n(a) whether the mark applied for registration was used in respect of the goods for which the mark was registered?\n(b) whether the respondent had a bonafide intention to use the mark applied for under section 18 of the trade and merchandise marks act?\n(c) whether the mark registered in favour of the respondent is a service mark? (d) whether there is a non use of registered trade mark by the respondent for a period of over 5 years and 1 month.\n(e) whether the registered trade mark is disentitled for protection in a court of law under section 11(e) of the trade and merchandise marks act?\n(f) whether the registered trade mark has lost its distinctiveness and is liable to be removed under section 32(c)?\n(g) whether the respondent has committed fraud while obtaining registration of the mark?\n(h)to what further relief?\n\nANALYSIS\nwhether the application is under section 46 or under section 56 or a composite application under both sections,it is a pre-requisite that the applicant must be a person aggrieved.\nsection 46(1) of the 1958 act enables any person aggrieved to apply for removal of registered trade mark from the register on the ground of non use as stated in clause (a) and/or clause (b).\nto be an aggrieved person under section 46,he must be one whose interest is affected in some possible way; it must not be a fanciful suggestion of grievance.\na likelihood of some injury or damage to the applicant by such trade mark remaining on the register may meet the test of locus standi.\nin kerly's law of trade marks and trade names (11th edition) at page 166,the legal position with regard to 'person aggrieved' has been summarized thus the persons who are aggrieved are all persons who are in some way or the other substantially interested in having the mark removed where it is a question of removal from the register; including all persons who would be substantially damaged if the mark remained, and all trade rivals over whom an advantage was gained by a trader who was getting the benefit of a registered trade mark to which he was not entitled.\nthe court accept the above statement of law.\nsections 46 and 56 require 'person aggrieved' to apply for removal of the registered trade mark from the register or rectification of a trade mark in the register,the expression 'person aggrieved' for the purposes of these two sections has different connotations.\nin hardie trading ltd 2003 indlaw sc 756.(2003) 11 scc 92),this court stated that  the phrase \"person aggrieved\" is a common enough statutory precondition for a valid complaint or appeal.\nthe phrase has been variously construed depending on the context in which it occurs.\nthree sections viz.sections 46,56 and 69 of the act contain the phrase.\nsection 46 deals with the removal of a registered trade mark from the register on the ground of non-use.\nthis section presupposes that the registration which was validly made is liable to be taken off by subsequent non-user.\nsection 56 on the other hand deals with situations where the initial registration should not have been or was incorrectly made.\nbut if the ground for rectification is merely based on non-user", "doc_id": "b4a8e38a-e776-477e-8152-e6252df16d14", "embedding": null, "doc_hash":

that in some possible way he may be damaged or injured if the trade mark is allowed to stand.\naddisons' application was one under section 46 and the test to determine whether the applicant was a \"person aggrieved\" within the meaning of that section should have been the one laid down by romer,j.in wright case and not the one propounded by the house of lords in the matter of powell's trade mark.\nin a recent decision in the case of kabushiki kaisha toshiba  (2008) 10 scc 766) 2008 indlaw sc 1395, this court stated that section 46 speaks for private interest while section 56 speaks of a public interest.\nin the first place,when the first respondent applied for rectification/removal in respect of three registrations in classes 7,9 and 16,it must have shown in respect of each of them that it is a 'person aggrieved' and the ipab must have separately considered in respect of each registration the locus standi of the first respondent as the considerations for each entry might not have been common.\nduring the pendency of the applications,certain events had taken place which had some bearing on the question of locus standi of the first respondent insofar as invocation of section 46 (1) of the 1958 act is concerned.\nin terms of section 46(1),not only that the applicant has to show that he is an aggrieved person as his interest is being affected but the ipab must also be satisfied,before it directs the removal of registered trade mark,that the applicant is an aggrieved person before it invokes the power in directing the removal of the  26 registered trade mark.\nthis is so because the pre-requisite for exercise of power under section 46(1) is that the applicant is a person aggrieved.\nin the circumstances, the court was satisfied that the applications made by the first respondent for rectification/removal of the subject trade marks from the register need to be considered afresh by the ipab in accordance with law and the observations made above.\nsince the first respondent has also grievance in connection with the impugned order particularly with regard to non-consideration of its case under section 56 of the 1958 act, the court refrained from going into the merits of the diverse contentions raised before us and leave the parties to agitate these contentions before the ipab.\n\nSTATUTE\ns.46 of the trade and merchandise marks

joined in that suit on the allegation that the latter was put in possession of mortgage properties by the former subsequent to the coming into existence of the mortgages.\nthat suit was resisted by the defendants,each of them having filed separate written statements which in sub-stance did not differ from each other.\nthe defence in those written statements was that defendant-l and his family members had become tenants of the suit properties in the year 1959-1960 and had continued to be such tenants at the time of mortgage deeds executed in respect of those properties in the year 1961 and thereafter.\nthe civil court notwithstanding the defence of the defendants recorded its findings.\nsuch findings were firstly,that the defendants had failed to prove that the suit properties were sold in favour of defendant-l subsequent to the giving of security of those properties in his favour under the mortgage deeds; secondly,that the defendants had failed to prove the past tenancy of the suit properties on its view that what was pleaded by them in the written statements was tenancy prior to the date of filing of the suit; and thirdly,that the mortgages of the suit properties were mortgages by 'conditional sale.\nthe defendants questioned the judgments and decrees of the trial court and the appellate court by filing a second appeal against the same in the high court of gujarat.\nthe high

section 4 of the bt &; al act it was not open to the defendants to claim that they were the tenants of suit properties and if that be so question of raising issue of tenancy by the civil court in the

by a tenant or a lessee being a lesser estate and the right of reversion of the landlord (lessor) being a higher estate,the lessee's lease-hold right in respect of the property merges in reversion when that right of reversion,i.e.,the landlord's (lessor's) right of reversion comes to the tenant or lessee which happens when the landlord having a right to sell his reversion to the tenant holding the lease-hold sells the whole of it to the tenant (lessee).\nwhen the landlord mortgages the lease-hold property of the tenant to the tenant himself,he does not part with the right of reversion which he has in respect of that property.\nif that be so,merger of lease-hold estate in reversion cannot arise,inasmuch as,there cannot be any inconsistency or incompatibility in one person being the tenant and also the mortgagee of the same property,for in that event instead of the tenant paying rent to the landlord he may adjust it against the amount claimable by him as a mortgagee from the landlord.\nin the case of a mortgage the estate that is outstanding is the equity of redemption of the mortgagor.\ntherefore,there cannot be a merger of lease and mortgage in respect of the same property since neither of them is a higher or lesser estate than the other.\nmoreover,if a lessee of a property takes a mortgage of the sum property from the landlord,it would be unreasonable to attribute to a tenant the intention to surrender the tenancy and to invoke the sophisticated doctrine of implied surrender as has been held by the gujarat high court in patel atmaram nathudas

his favour by the lessor-mortgagor and only if an implied surrender of lossee's rights could be inferred then the mortgagor would be entitled to have delivery of physical possession upon redemption

who contended that the respondent was admittedly working and was being paid only for six days in a week and that a pregnant woman worker is entitled to maternity benefit for 72 days which are the normal working days in twelve weeks and not for 84 days,as no wage is payable for the seventh day of the week i.e.sunday,which is a nonworking wageless holiday.\nthe labour court allowed the claim of the respondent.\nthereupon the establishment moved the high court at madras u/art.226 of the constitution challenging the,decision of the labour court contending that the claim made by the respondent was untenable as normally a worker works only for six days in a week and the maternity benefit had to be computed only for 72 days.\nas against this, the respondent pleaded that the computation had to be made not with reference to the actual number of working days but with reference to total number of days covered by twelve weeks i.e.84 days.\nthe high court allowed the petition holding that twelve weeks for which maternity benefit is provided for in subs.(3) of s.5 of the act must be taken to mean twelve weeks of work and the computation of the benefit had to be made with reference to the actual days on which the woman would have worked but for her inability.\naggrieved by this decision,the respondent filed an appeal to this court.\n\nARGUMENT\nsince u/s.5 (1) of the act,the maternity benefit has to be computed with reference to the period of the workers' actual absence thereby meaning absence on days on which there was work excluding sundays and the term 'week\" in the context of 'sub-ss.(1) and (3) of s.5 of the act is to be under stood as a week of work consisting of six days and in the instant case,respondent no.2 was working and earning wages for six days in a week,the seventh day being a wageless holiday,her claim cannot be sustained.\nin support of his contention.mr.pai has referred us to the full bench decision of the kerala high court in malayalam plantations

adopted by the general conference of the international labour organisation.\nthe scheme of s.5 of the act clearly indicates that a woman worker who expects delivery had to be paid maternity benefit for all the seven days of the week including sundays falling within the ante-natal and post-natal periods specified in the section.\n\nISSUE\nthe real question is as to what is the connotation of the

above make it clear that a woman worker who expects a child is entitled to maternity benefit for a maximum period of twelve weeks which is split up into two periods viz.prenatal and post-natal.\nthe first one i.e.prenatal or ante-natal period is limited to the period of woman's actual absence extending upto six weeks immediately preceding and including the day on which her delivery occurs and the second one which is postnatal compulsory period consists of six weeks immediately following the day of delivery.\nthe benefit has to be calculated for the aforesaid two periods on the basis of the average daily wage.\naccording to the explanation appended to s.5(1) of the act,the average daily wage has to be computed taking into consideration the average of the woman's wager, payable to her for the days on which she has worked during the period of three calendar months immediately preceding the date from which she absents herself on account of maternity,or one rupee a day,whichever is higher.\nfor fixing the average daily wage,it has therefore first to be ascertained whether the wages with were paid or were payable to the woman was for 'time work' or for 'piece work'.\nit has next to be ascertained as to what were the cash wages paid or payable to her in terms of the definition contained in s.3 (n) of the act for the days on which she worked during the period of three-calendar months immediately preceding the date of delivery,reckoned according to the british calendar month.\nthe total wages thus worked out are to be divided by the number of days in the aforesaid three calendar months in order to arrive at the average daily wage.\nafter thus finding out the average daily wage,the liability of the employer in respect of the maternity benefit has to be calculated in terms of s.5 of the act for both ore-natal and post-natal period indicated above.\n\nSTATUTE\ns.2(1) of the act is applicable to every establishment being a factory, mine or plantation .\nsection 2(2)  of the act specifically excludes the applicability of the provisions of the act to any factory or other establishment to which the provisions of the employees state insurance act,1948 apply for the time being.\ns.3(n) of the act defines \"wages\" as under :- \"3(n).--wages means all remuneration paid or payable in cash to a woman,if the terms of the contract of employment,express or implied,were fulfilled and includes- (1) such cash allowances (including dearness allowance and house rent allowance) as a woman is for the time being entitled to; (2) incentive bonus; and (3) the money value of

whom they have been allotted under the decree and the nalban fishery being one such fishery,the possession thereof was required to be given to the person in whose favour the said fishery has been allotted.\n\nISSUE\nwhether in the suit for partition amongst the members of the sarkar family which was ultimately disposed of by a compromise decree in this court nalban fishery had been allotted to some members of the sarkar family and whether such decree would affect the rights of the state and bind the state of west bengal.\n\nANALYSIS\nthe calcutta high court,both the learned single judge as well as the division bench committed serious error of law in directing the receiver to take possession of nalban fishery from the state of west bengal and deliver-the vacant possession of the same to the members of the sarkar family.\nthe nalban fishery was one of the items of property in the suit for partition is not disputed.\nit is also not disputed that the state of west bengal though was not a party to the suit but in course of proceeding before this court by an order of the court the said state of west bengal was impleaded as a party.\nthe aforesaid order directing impleadment of the state of west bengal as a 7 party was obviously intended for the purpose that the interest of the state and the rights of the state in relation of the state and the rights of the state in relation of the state and the rights of the state in relation to several fisheries could be protected.\nfurther while directing the receiver to handover possession of the various fisheries covered by the final decree to the parties to whom they have been allotted under the decree,this court also protected the interest of the state by observing that they made it quite clear that this will not in any manner prejudice or affect the right of the state to its claim over the fisheries under the west bengal acquisition act 1955 or under any other statute.\nit is an undisputed fact that nalban fishery had been requisitioned much prior to the aforesaid decree of this court and,therefore,the rights of the state to the fishery either by virtue of the requisition order or by virtue of any provision of any other statute remained protected and as such said state of west bengal can't be bound down by the so-called allotment of fisheries in favour of some members of the sarkar family under the compromise decree in question.\nthe district magistrate 24 parganas who was appointed as receiver took possession of several fisheries including nalban fishery obviously on the impression that the lease in respect of the said fishery which had been granted by the sarkar family had lapsed.\nthe said receiver was not aware of the fact that nalban fishery had in fact requisitioned by the state of west bengal and the state is in possession of the same.\nthe successor receiver,in the circumstances,therefore,was fully justified in bringing it to the notice of this court by giving a second report indicating therein that his predecessor had erroneously taken the possession of nalban fishery which is in contravention of the directions of this court and for which the receiver offered his unconditional apology.\nthe court did not find any illegality in the act of the succeeding receiver in rectifying the earlier mistake and re-delivering the possession of nalban fishery to the state of west bengal.\nthe aforesaid order cannot be held to operate as res judicata taking away the rights of the state of west bengal in respect of the nalban fishery as the state was not a party to the proceedings.\nthe rights and

been present at the house at the time of the incident and the accused had assaulted and outraged the modesty of the said sheela devi,but in the charge the name of the victim had been erroneously mentioned,say as sushila devi or prakashi devi (though there was no person by such name),and the inquiry exclusively referred to the assault and outraging the modesty of sheela devi,the court could infer that the accused was not misled and the error in the charge was immaterial.\nthe court having charged the accused with the offence of having trespassed into the house of prakashi devi with intent to assault her and having further charged him for having assaulted the said prakashi devi by outraging her modesty,convicts him on the ground that though he did not assault or outrage the modesty of prakashi devi,he had outraged the modesty of sheela devi,that would lead to failure of justice.\nthere was a material error in the charge as it violated the requirement of sub-s.(1) of

stated that the high court had erred insofar as it upheld the factum of urgency in the absence of a categorical finding,an enquiry under section 5a would have been detrimental to public interest.\n\nANALYSIS\nin connection with land acquisition proceeding whenever the provision of s.17 and its various sub-sections including s.17(4) is used in the name of taking urgent or emergent action and the right of hearing of the land holder under section 5a is dispensed with,the court is called upon to consider a few fundamentals in the exercise of such powers.\nthe concept of public purpose in land acquisition has to be viewed from an angle which is consistent with the concept of a welfare state.\nthe concept of public purpose cannot remain static for all time to come.\nthe concept,even though sought to be defined u/s.3(f) of the act,is not capable of any precise definition.\nthe said definition,having suffered several amendments,has assumed the character of an inclusive one.\nit must be accepted that in construing public purpose,a broad and overall view has to be taken and the focus must be on ensuring maximum benefit to the largest number of people.\nany attempt by the state to acquire land by promoting a public purpose to benefit a particular group of people or to serve any particular interest at the cost of the interest of a large section of people especially of the common people defeats the very concept of public purpose.\neven though the concept of public purpose was introduced by pre-constitutional legislation,its application must be consistent with the constitutional ethos and especially the chapter under fundamental rights and also the directive principles.\nthe mandate of art.13 of the constitution that any pre-constitutional law cannot in any way take away or abridge rights conferred under part-iii must be kept in mind.\nby judicial interpretation the contents of these part iii rights are constantly expanded.\nthe meaning of public purpose in acquisition of land must be judged on the touchstone of this expanded view of part-iii rights.\nthe courts must examine these questions very carefully when little indians lose their small property in the name of mindless acquisition at the instance of the state.\nif public purpose can be satisfied by not rendering common man homeless and by exploring other avenues of acquisition,the courts,before sanctioning an acquisition,must in exercise of its power of judicial review,focus its attention on the concept of social and economic justice.\nwhile examining these questions of public importance,the courts,especially the higher courts,cannot afford to act as mere umpires.\nthe construction of jail is certainly in public interest and for such construction land may be acquired.\nbut such acquisition can be made only by strictly following the mandate of the said act.\nin the facts of this case,such acquisition cannot be made by invoking emergency provisions of s.17.\nif so advised,government can initiate acquisition proceeding by following the provision of section 5a of the act and in accordance with law.\n\nSTATUTE\nthe land acquisition act i of 1894 does not provide that persons having an interest in land which it is proposed to acquire,shall have the right of objecting to such acquisition; nor is government bound to enquire into and consider any objections that may reach them.\nthe object of this bill is to provide that a local government shall not declare,u/s.6 of the act,that any land is needed for a public purpose unless time has been allowed after the notification u/s.4 for persons interested in the land to put in objections and for such objections to be considered by the local government.\n\n", "doc_id": "63b7c2b4-21dc-4270-aabb-18cb8e2e84de",

appellant's case that he had been in occupation of the said 160 acres of cherikkal land (unregistered dry lands in hilly tracts) about which and the adjoining lands there was a dispute as to whether the same belonged to a jenmi family known as koodalvalli illom--hereinafter called 'the illom or to the government of the erstwhile travancore state.\nthe appellant's father and the appellant had occupied these lands, made improvement thereon by planting coconut trees, arecanut palms, peppervines, rubber-trees, jack trees, other trees, and by constructing bungalow, huts, wells etc. in the bona fide belief that the lands belonged to the illom.\nit was stated that according to the practice prevailing in the erstwhile state of travancore the cultivators could enter into unoccupied waste lands belonging to the janmies with the object of cultivating and improving them, and as they held the lands under them by paying rent, the consent of the jemies to such occupation was implied.\nin respect of the 160 acres of land of' the illom which were occupied by the appellant's father and the appellant, there was a dispute between the illom and the travancore state from about 1848.\nwhile this dispute was pending it appears the appellant applied to the conservator of forests for registration of the lands in his name, but the application was rejected in 1919 stating that the land applied for cannot be registered.\nwhile the application for registration was pending, the dispute between the illom and the state of travancore had reached a stage when the illom had to institute a suit in the district court at quilon for a declaration of its title to those properties.\nin that suit the appellant, after his application for registration was rejected, sought to get himself impleaded, but that application also was rejected. thereafter the suit filed by the illom was dismissed.\nan appeal against it was dismissed.\nagainst  an appeal was filed in the high court of travancore.\nthe high court issued a commission for inspecting the properties and the commissioner in his report set out the improvements made by the appellant on the lands which comprised of a bungalow in which the appellant was residing, a number of small houses. a rubbers state, and a large number of other valuable trees like jack trees, mango trees, coconut trees etc. it appears that as there was no injunction restraining his dispossession.\nthe appellant, pursuant to this order, was dispossessed from the lands and possession of these lands was given to the second defendant nair service society ltd. in august 1939. thereafter the suit out of which this appeal arises was filed against the government.\n\nARGUMENT\nthere is no order forfeiting the improvements as required under s. 9 of the act, and if s. 9 does not apply and there is no right of forfeiture as contemplated under s. 9, then the appellant is entitled to compensation under the general law.\nas the appellant was not served with a notice to quit as required under s. 9 of the act but was forcibly evicted without giving him an opportunity of cutting and taking away the trees etc. from the lands from which he was evicted, he would be entitled to claim compensation for the improvements made by him.\nthe appellant did not occupy the lands as a trespasser with a bona fide claim of title because it was his case that he trespassed upon the land with a bona fide intention to improve the land, and as such he can still be considered as a bona fide trespasser entitled to improvements under the general law.\neven if trees are not included in s. 9 and no notice of forfeiture is necessary, under the general law even a trespasser on the land, whether bona fide or not, is entitled to compensation or damages for the improvements made by him on the land.\nit was not his case nor is it under the general law necessary for a person who trespassed on the land to trespass with a claim of", "doc_id":

{"text": "law necessary for a person who trespassed on the land to trespass with a claim of bona fide title.\n\nISSUE\nit is the case of the appellant that even, after the act was passed, unauthorised occupants of land belonging to the government who had made improvements therein had, under the rules made both under the act and the land assignment act a preferential claim over others for getting kuthakapattom or assignment of the property in their possession.\nseveral issues were framed, but it is not necessary to refer to: them except to say that the suit was decreed only for rs. 3000/being the value of the appellant's bungalow taken possession of by the respondent.\n\nANALYSIS\nthe possession of the appellant ,commenced after his application for registration was rejected in 1919, and the improvements, if any must have been effected only thereafter with full knowledge that the title to the lands was in dispute between the illom and the government, is unassailable.\nthe court had earlier adverted the fact that after the application for registration was ,rejected the appellant tried to get himself impleaded in the suit filed by the illom against the state which application was also rejected and so the claim that his possession was bona fide or that he was a bona fide trespasser has no validity. this finding is fortified by s. 5 of the act which provides that from and after the commencement of the act it shall not be lawful for any person to occupy land which is the property of the government whether poramboke or not without the permission from the government or such officer of the government as may be ,empowered in that behalf.\nin view of this specific provision the contravention of which is punishable under s. 6 thereof, his conduct in applying for registration and for getting himself impleaded in the suit of the illom against the government, would show that he knew that the land was government land or land in which the government had a claim.\nthis view of ours is supported by the case of clark and another v. gaskarth.\nthat was a case of a trespass for breaking and entering the closes of the plaintiffs and tearing up, digging up, cutting down, and carrying away the plaintiff's trees, plants, roots and seeds, growing on the closes.\nnotice of this trespass was given to the defendant. at the time of the distress the sum of pound 281.6 s. was due from the plaintiffs to the defendant for rent in respect of the nursery ground.\nthe question before the court was whether the plaintiffs were entitled to recover against the defendant damages caused to them by cutting down and carrying away the plaintiffs' trees.\nthe court rejected the contention that the trees and shrubs could be detrained and held that the word product' in the eighth section of the statute did not extend to trees and shrubs growing in a nurseryman's ground, but that it was confined to products of a similar nature with those specified in that section, to all of which the process of becoming ripe, and of being cut, gathered, made, and laid up when ripe, was incidental.\nin our view, therefore, trees are not included within the meaning of 'other products raised on the, land' in s. 9 of the act and there is, therefore, no obligation on the government to give notice of forfeiture under that section.\nthe appellant was not a mere trespasser and had deliberately entered upon the lands knowing full well that he had no right, claim or title to the lands or had in any manner a right to enter the land and has been rightly evicted as a trespasser.\n\nSTATUTE\nthis practice it seems, was also current in respect of lands belonging to the, government before the travancore land conservancy act 4 of 109.\nsection 9 of the act is in the following terms.\nany person unauthorised occupying any land for which he is liable to pay a fine under section 6 and an assessment or prohibitory assessment under section 7, may be summarily evicted by the division peishkar, and

13.5.1979 and 12.7.1986 and 13.7.1986 and 12.7.1993.\nappellant is said to have commenced its business of manufacturing and selling centrifugal pumps also under the mark 'field marshall.\nallegedly,on

use the said mark in respect of centrifugal pumps by the appellant laying a claim that it had been using the said mark since 1963.\nrespondent no.1 thereafter filed a suit in the delhi high court for grant of a decree of permanent injunction being suit no.2408 of 1985 alleging infringement of the said mark and/or claiming right of passing off in respect thereof.\nan ex parte order of injunction was passed on 19.12.1985 against the defendant.\nmeanwhile,a temporary ex parte injunction is issued against the defendants restraining them from manufacturing or selling either themselves or through

has not given any reason for setting aside the appeal against acquittal which was passed after appreciating the entire evidence on record.\nhe further submitted that there was not only shifting of time of the alleged occurrence but also shifting of the place of occurrence from the hall to the outside verandah and courtyard to suit the convenience of the prosecution case. he has drawn our attention towards the entire evidence on record including the cross-examination part and with the help of the same he submitted that the entire alleged incident in question had taken place when there was complete darkness at the scene of occurrence.\na scuffle started between the nephew and the uncle in which the accused persons also received injuries and, therefore, the right of private defence of the appellant was available and in that view of the matter, the order of conviction and sentence is liable to be set aside.\n\nANALYSIS\nthe starting point of the incident in question as indicated from the evidence on record is the hall where apparently a dispute started between the parties with regard to the electricity connection in the house.\nthe deceased tried to put off the light of one particular room at which the appellant and other accused persons became annoyed and the appellant switched on the light which was again switched off by the deceased.\nat this, the deceased became annoyed and the appellant removed the fuse of the electricity which act of his plunged the entire house into darkness.\nit is also clear and established that thereafter a lamp was brought by accused no. 3 to the room besides another lamp which was already burning in the said room itself.\nbut, in any case, there was an electricity light post in the front of the house which was giving enough light to the house.\nthere is also evidence on record to show that even outsiders were watching the incident from the road which indicates that there was sufficient light for them to see what was happening in the house where the incident had taken place.\nthere was indeed some scuffle between the parties during the course of which accused no. 1 received simple injuries and the deceased died of the two stab injuries inflicted by the present appellant.\nhe, in his deposition specifically stated that he found that the back door as well as the front door of the house were latched from inside and in front of the house there was a road where there was an electricity pole and there was a street tube light by which the house could be visible and even the lights of the vehicles were flashed at the house.\nhe stated that although the house had electricity connection, but was not having the electricity supply.\nhe gave instructions to his subordinate and also to the people around that nobody should touch any article lying at the scene of occurrence.\nhe stated that he made preliminary enquiry and brought yashoda and her two daughters to the police station and sent two other officers in search of accused nos. 1 and 2 who were not found in the house.\nhe also stated that he got the complaint registered at the police station which was lodged by pw-1 and that on the next day he again went to the scene of offence and seized the properties involved in the crime which were sealed.\nhe also recovered the knife at the instance of accused sharmila which he seized. on 28.04.1988, that is, after about 9 days of the incident, accused nos. 1 and 2 surrendered before the police and on their surrender they were taken into custody. it was found that accused no. 1 was having injury on his back and he was medically examined.\non medical examination his injury was found to be simple.\neven assuming that pw-21, the investigating officer could have entered the aforesaid information received from psi of panaji police station in the general diary, yet they said entry could not have been held or treated to be an fir.\nthe information received by him was very cryptic and without any

were inmates of the house and they would know as to who had given the blows for they specifically stated that initially the appellant did not have the knife in his hand but when the deceased and others went to the balcony then he went inside the house and brought a knife with which he gave stab injuries to the deceased which became fatal and as a result of which the deceased died while he was being taken to the hospital.\nthe aforesaid eye-witnesses, although, are related witnesses, were natural witnesses for they were the inmates of the house where the incident had taken place.\nthe said eye-witnesses are consistent about the principal act of the appellant in stabbing the deceased.\nthe discrepancies which were sought to be pointed out are minor discrepancies without in any manner

the appellant were considered by us in the light of evidence on record and we find that none of the aforesaid submissions has any basis.\nthere is cogent and reliable evidence on record to prove and establish that the accused has committed the act of stabbing as a result of which the deceased had died.\nbefore dwelling further into the factual matrix of the case on the basis of which the high court convicted the appellant u/s. 302 ipc; it would be useful to briefly recapitulate the law on the point.\nthat being the well settled legal position, when we test the factual background of the present case on the principles laid down by this court in the aforesaid decisions, we are unable to agree with the views taken by the high court.\nas already noted, it is quite clear from the record that there was an altercation preceding the incident.\nthe place of occurrence is a residence inhabited by both the parties and there is no evidence on record that the deceased was armed with any weapon.\ninitially the accused-appellant also did not have any weapon with him but during the course of the incident he went inside and got a knife with the help of which he stabbed the deceased. pw-7 in his cross examination has categorically stated that death due to stab injury was in consequence of injury no. 1 and all other injuries were superficial in nature.\nso, it was only injury no. 1 which was fatal in nature.\nfactually therefore, there was only one main injury caused due to stabbing and that also was given on the back side of the deceased and therefore, it cannot be said that there was any intention to kill or to inflict an injury of a particular degree of seriousness.\nrecords clearly establish that there was indeed a scuffle between the parties with regard to the availability of electricity in a particular room and during the course of scuffle the appellant also received an injury which was simple in nature and that there was heated exchange of words and scuffle between the parties before the actual incident of stabbing took place.\nthere is, therefore, provocation and the incident happened at the spur of the moment.\nthat being the factual position, we are of the considered view that the present case cannot be said to be a case u/s. 302 ipc but it is a case falling under s. 304 part ii ipc.\nit is trite law that s. 304 part ii comes into play when the death is caused by doing an act with knowledge that it is likely to cause death but there is no intention on the part of the accused either to cause death or to cause such bodily injury as is

signs.\nthe main controversy was whether the appellant had sublet the premises to defendant no.2,bharat neon signs or whether he being a partner of the said firm had permitted the said firm to use the premises in question.\npartnership deed records six persons who were to run the business in manufacturing and selling bharat neon signs tubes.\non or about 24th of october,1960. another partnership

has stated further that the suit premises were to be used for business and he could use it for any business and he joined in partnership with defendants nos.2 to 5 somewhere in 1961 to prepare neon

a revision is generally given to a superior court so that it may satisfy itself that a particular case is decided according to law.\nthe jurisdiction of high court is to correct all errors of law

establishment of a special court for the trial of offences relating to transactions in securities and for matters connected therewith.\nin terms of the provisions of the act, along with late harshad

ascertained having regard to the purpose and object it seeks to achieve.\nthe right of a person notified to file an application or to raise a defence that he is not liable in terms of the provisions of the act or in any event, the properties attached should not be sold in discharge of the liabilities can be taken at the initial stage by filing an application in terms of sub-s. (2) of s. 4 of the act.\nbut, at the stage when liabilities are required to be discharged, the notified person may inter alia raise a contention inter alia for the purpose of establishing that the properties held and possessed by them are sufficient to meet their liabilities.\nin terms of the provisions of the act, the special court had been conferred a very wide power.\nthe appellants herein are notified persons in terms of the provisions of the act. therefore, all the properties belonging to them stand attached. such attachment being automatic, no finding was required to be arrived at that the same had been acquired either during the notified period or the appellants were involved in offences in transactions in securities.\nin tejkumar balakrishna ruia v. a.k. menon and another [(1997) 9 scc 123] 1996 indlaw sc 2403, this court held: \"in their view, the terms of sub-s.

(3) would have stated that such property would stand attached the moment it was acquired by the notified person. the act would also have made provision for a subsistence allowance or the like for the notified person. it seems to us that to give to s. 3(3) the wide meaning that has been ascribed to it in the judgment and order under appeal would render it perilously close to being held unconstitutional, for it would deprive the notified person, so long as he remained a notified person, from earning a livelihood. even to say that", "doc_id": "75a6b013-986a-4c99-8525-9eafbc81bcc9", "embedding": null, "doc_hash": "ba63b8fef343f19379d00ca4f748e410cf34da41cc7de17e9f1983795ea75b24", "extra_info": null, "node_info": {"start": 3949, "end": 8148, "_node_type": "1"}, "relationships": {"1": "d6e6062c-12d2-4a70-8c91-cdcc660c0091", "2": "5f64308a-641a-434a-84e7-5a393dc1583c", "3": "baf0a55b-9057-493c-8796-0f915c96953e"}}, "__type__": "1"}, "baf0a55b-9057-493c-8796-0f915c96953e": {"__data__": {"text": "as he remained a notified person, from earning a livelihood. even to say that such interpretation would reduce a notified person to beggary would not be accurate  because the alms that he received, being his property, would stand attached. the apprehension expressed by the special court does not appear to be well founded: if what a notified person obtains by way of purported income or gift or inheritance is really his own money, such money would, upon establishment of the fact, stand attached automatically under the provisions of s. 3(3).\nin any event, it is for parliament to enact a law that meets all contingencies. the courts must interpret the law as it reads.\nwhile a purposive interpretation is permissible where two interpretations are possible, the purposive interpretation must be such as preserves the constitutionality of the provision.\nit is no doubt true that the law of limitation bars a remedy but not a right.

the correctness or otherwise of the said contention of the appellants at this stage, however, there cannot be any doubt whatsoever that they being notified persons, all their properties would be

company was acquired on 28th october,1984 under sugar undertakings acquisition act,1971 and the unit was vested with the u.p.state sugar corporation.\nit is also not in dispute that labour and other dues were payable by the company apart from sale tax dues and the loan was given by the state government between 1977-1984 for payment of such dues.\nthe high court though noticed that s.8 of the u.p.state sugar undertakings acquisition act,1971 empowers the prescribed authority to decide any dispute regarding the amount payable to any person or authority in respect of earlier liabilities of the undertaking,but it wrongly held that in view of the provisions of the u.p.sugar undertakings acquisition act,1971 any liability incurred by the company or loan etc.taken by the receiver is not

auction purchasers to claim interest,in case the auction got cancelled or set aside by the court of law.\ncounsel for the parties also could not refer any of the clauses of auction prescribing interest on refund of amount in case of cancellation of auction or sale.\nin state of maharashtra and others vs.maimuma banu and others,(2003) 7 scc 448 2003 indlaw sc 625,the question arose as to whether interest was payable on rental compensation.\nin the said case,government resolution provided for payment of rental compensation expeditiously but no provision was made to pay interest in case of delayed payment.\nthis court in the said case held that the   crucial question is whether there can be any direction for interest on rental compensation once it is held that the same has to be paid within the time frame,notwithstanding the fact that there is no statutory obligation.\nappeals are allowed to the extent indicated without any stipulation of costs.\ntaking into consideration the aforesaid factor while working out equities,it would,therefore,be appropriate to direct the state to pay interest at the rate of 6% on the amount to be refunded as per the high court's order.\n\n",

and a service industry,and does not manufacture any product or carry on trade.its work force consists of engineers and supervisors and different categories of workmen.\nthe tata consultant employees union served a charter of demands in july,1974,on the appellant,and as their demands were not accepted and conciliation proceedings proved fruitless,the state government made a reference of the dispute under s.10(1)(d),industrial tribunal,maharashtra for adjudication.\nthe union filed a statement before the tribunal claiming an upward revision of the wage scales and dearness allowance and an increase from fifteen years to twenty years in the span for earning annual increments.\nit was urged that the efficiency bar,as a feature of the wage scales,should be removed.\nthe dearness allowance,it was claimed,should be granted on a slab system.\nthe claim of the union was resisted by the appellant,who maintained that the existing wage scales were fair and reasonable on a region-cum-industry basis and that it would not be possible for the appellant to bear the additional financial burden if the demands of the union were accepted.\nthe appellant had introduced various pay scales in 1973 and some time later they were revised.\nthere was no separate dearness allowance until january,1977 when it was introduced for the first time.\nhouse rent allowance was also paid.\ndearness allowance became payable at 10% of the basic wage subject to a minimum of rs.50/ and house rent allowance at 30% of the basic salary.\nthe tribunal observed that compared with the increased paying capacity of the appellant,an inference drawn from the prosperity enjoyed by the appellant over the years,there was definite need for revising the wage scales.\nthe tribunal took note of the elaborate scales of wages already existing in the wage structure of the appellant and decided \"to modify the existing structure of the scales with flat increases in each category.\nthe revised wage scales,the tribunal directed,should take effect retrospectively from 1st january,1976.\nit also laid down the principle enabling the actual fitment of the workmen in their respective wage scales as on that date and also provided for the number of increments to which they would be entitled having regard to the period of completed service.\ntwo days after the award was made,an application was made by the union stating: \"in the said award,your honour has observed,at the end of para 22,in view of the increase that is being allowed in the basic pay,i do not propose to revise the existing scheme of dearness allowance.\"\nthe workmen have filed an appeal by special leave, in which they have challenged the rejection by the tribunal of their claim in respect of dearness allowance which,they contend,should be pegged to the cost of living index and should not be a fixed amount.\n\nARGUMENT\nconsidering the appeal of tata consulting engineers first,the contention of learned counsel for the appellant is that having regard to the financial capacity of the appellant the tribunal erred in making the wage scales retrospective and,in any event,in ranging the retrospectivity back to 1st january,1976.\nthe learned counsel for the appellant had covered a wide field,but in the end he states that the appellant is aggrieved by two matters only.\none is the retrospectivity attached to the revised wage scales,and the other is the flat increase given to each employee of rs.150/-in the category of draughtsmen and rs.100/-in other categories resulting from the order dated 22nd december,1978.\nit is urged that the amendment results in the inclusion of a flat increase of rs.150/-to each workman in the case of draughtsman and rs.100/-to each workman in the case",

and,therefore,falling beyond the jurisdiction of the tribunal.\nthe only contention of the workmen is that the tribunal should have fixed the dearness allowance in communion with the cost of living index.\n\nISSUE\nthe primary and basic question considered by the industrial tribunal,in making the award dated december 20,1978 was the question of revision of the wage-scales.\nimplicit and intrinsically connected with the question of revision of the wage-scales were the questions of fitment of employees into the wage-scales and flat or ad-hoc increase of salaries of workmen wherever considered necessary.\n\nANALYSIS\nit must be remembered that although the wage scales were introduced as long ago as 1973 they were maintained at that level except for a slight revision some time thereafter.\nno dearness allowance was paid until the beginning of 1977 and the house rent allowance also was introduced about that time.\nthe cost of living had gone on increasing from 1972 onwards and,as the tribunal has found,the dearness allowance and house rent allowance made no appreciable impact in neutralising the increasing cost.\nduring all these years,the appellant had continued to enjoy increasing profits; nonetheless the emoluments received by the workmen did not receive the impress of the appellant's growing prosperity.\nthe charter of demands was presented by the union in july,1974 and when conciliation proceedings failed the state government made the reference to the industrial tribunal in 1975.\nthe tribunal has referred to various considerations which prevailed with it in giving retrospectivity to the revised pay scales.\nthey are considerations which cannot be ignored.\naccordingly,the contention raised on behalf of the appellant against retrospectivity of the wage scales must be rejected.\nthe financial capacity of the appellant,and the related study of its annual profits from 1968 to 1977,were examined from that view point.\nthe sufficiency of the existing pay scales was considered in detail,and regard was had to their original structure and the accretions made subsequently by way of dearness allowance and house rent allowance.\nfor the purpose of restructuring the pay scales the tribunal ruled on the paying capacity of the appellant,both with reference to the profits of the preceding year as well as the prospects of the future.\nthe financial capacity,as the tribunal observed,constituted one of \"the principles which are required to be followed in the fixation of the wage structure.\"\nno ad hoc increase to the pay of each individual workman was intended.\nthe jurisdiction given to the tribunal by rule 31 is closely circumscribed.\nit is only a clerical mistake or error which can be corrected,and the clerical mistake or error must arise from an accidental slip or omission in the award.\nan accidental slip or omission implies that something was intended and contrary to that intention what should not have been included has been included or what should have been included has been omitted.\nit must be a mistake or error amenable to clerical correction only.\nit must not be a mistake or error which calls for rectification by modification of the conscious adjudication on the issues involved.\nthe omission of the words to each employee first after the figure rs.150/-and again after the figure rs.100/-was clearly an accidental slip or omission which the tribunal was entitled to correct.\nit will be noted that the pay scales of different categories were being restructured,and the flat increase envisaged there related to an increase in the general pay scales of different categories.\nindividual workmen were not present to the mind of the tribunal.\nthat the increase was pertinent to the general pay scales in the revised wage structure is patently clear from a comparison of the existing pay scales and the revised pay scales.\nthe comparative table of existing pay scales and the revised pay scales has been reproduced earlier.\nthe revised pay", "doc_id": "97e8b73f-e18b-41c2-9477-907a9bf6f89a", "embedding": null, "doc_hash": "5fa489f3945159efe999803117d6e608f21833cfdb6c4efa80b2fb2539cb06db",

different categories.\nno second flat increase was envisaged at all.\nthe amendment made by the tribunal has the effect of providing a second increase,this time to each individual workmen.\nif,as the tribunal has stated in the amendment order,the increase in paragraph 23 was intended to apply to each individual workmen,there is nothing in the body of the award to form the foundation on which the actual figures in the restructured pay scales can be made to rest.\nthere will be no explanation why the initial start of the revised pay scales has been increased by rs.150/-in the case of the category of draughtsmen and rs.100/-in the case of other categories.\nconsidering the fitment of the workman in the revised scales,it was stated in the award that a workman found drawing a salary less than the beginning of the grade would be stepped up to the beginning of the grade and if his pay fell between two steps in the reclassified pay scales the basic pay was to be fixed at the step higher in the revised scale.\nreliance was placed on the hindustan times ltd.,new delhi v.their workmen [1964] 1 scr 234 1962 indlaw sc 436,247 where it was observed by this court that dearness allowance should not remain fixed at any figure but should be on a sliding scale in order to neutralise a portion of the increase in the cost of living.\nreference was also made to bengal chemical &amp; pharmaceutical works limited v.its workmen [1969] 2 scr 113 1968 indlaw sc 183.\nnow,it is not a universal rule that the dearness allowance should in all cases be correlated with the cost of living index.\nit was open to the tribunal to adopt the position which it did.\nif the dearness allowance is linked with the cost of living index the whole award will have to be reopened and the entire basis on which it has been made will have to be reconsidered.\nthe award is a composite document in which the several elements of increased wage scales,larger increments,longer span of 20 years for earning increments,dearness allowance at 10% of the basic wage,besides several other benefits,have been integrated into a balanced arrangement in keeping with what the tribunal has found to be the financial capacity of the appellant.\nit is not possible to maintain one part of the award and supersede another.\nconspicuous by its absence is any reference to a flat increase in the pay of an individual workmen.\nwe are not impressed with the submission that the corrigendum was in effect a fresh award.\nwe,therefore,see no ground for quashing the of the tribunal.\ndearness allowance linked to cost of living index is ordinarily the best and the most scientific method of computing dearness allowance,it cannot always be said that an illegality warranting interference under article 136 is committed if some other method is adopted.\nthe tribunal has given satisfactory reason for adopting a different mode and we are not disposed to interfere with the award of the tribunal.\n\nSTATUTE\nin making the

3,1948 to render technical know-how to the indian company to be formed which would manufacture bicycles and market them under raleigh's indian trade marks.\npursuant thereto,a company called sen raleigh limited came into existence which manufactured cycles with technical assistance by the respondents-raleigh industries of u.k.and marketed the bicycles with a brand name and trade marks belonging to the respondents.\nsen raleigh was taken over by the government of india on september 8,1975 under the idr act and the government took over the management of sen raleigh limited.\nthe

unsustainable.\nthe high court did not consider the nature of the controversy and the prayer involved in the writ petition.\nby art.226 the power of issuing prerogative writs possessed by the

against whom the direction,order or writ is sought is a necessary party.\nunder article 227,however,what comes up before the high court is the order or judgment of a subordinate court or tribunal for the purpose of ascertaining whether in giving such judgment or order that subordinate court or tribunal has acted within its authority and according to law.\nthe nature of the exercise of the power under article 226,however,remains the same as in the case of the power of issuing prerogative writs possessed by the chartered high courts.\nit was open to the respondent to invoke the jurisdiction of the high court both u/arts.226 and 227 of the constitution of india.\nonce such a jurisdiction was invoked and when his writ petition was dismissed on merits,it cannot be said that the learned single judge had exercised his jurisdiction only u/art.226  of the constitution of india.\nthis conclusion directly flows from the relevant averments made in the writ petition and the nature of jurisdiction invoked by the respondent as noted by the learned single judge in his judgment,as seen earlier.\nconsequently,it could not be said that cl.15 of the letters patent was not attracted for preferring appeal against the judgment of the learned single judge.\nit is also necessary to note that the appellant being the respondent in letters patent appeal joined issues on merits and did not take up the contention that the letters patent appeal was not maintainable.\nfor all these reasons,therefore,the primary objection to the maintainability of the letters patent appeal as canvassed by learned counsel for the appellant,has to be repelled.\nthe high court was not justified in holding that the letters patent appeal was not maintainable.\nin addition,a bare reading of this court's earlier

addition, he was convicted for an offence punishable u/s. 376 of the ipc and sentenced to undergo rigorous imprisonment for 10 years and to a fine of rs.5, 000/- and in default of payment to undergo further r.i. for one year and u/s. 309 of the ipc to a sentence of simple imprisonment for one year.\nthe aforesaid convictions and sentences have been maintained by the high court and the matter is before us in these proceedings by way of special leave.\nat about 2.00 p.m., on 10th november 2002 a boy whose identity is not forthcoming, informed satnam singh that an incident of firing had taken place in the house of ujjagar singh .\nsatnam singh conveyed this information to sarpanch jora singh pw1 who was attending a marriage at that time.\njora singh accompanied by gurdeep singh pw3 thereupon rushed to ujjagar singh's house and found mukhtiar kaur lying dead with a gun shot injury and the appellant also with a gun shot injury lying unconscious on the ground in the adjoining room.\nit appears that mukhtiar kaur's relations with her in-laws had got strained and she had left her matrimonial home and come to live with ujjagar singh, her uncle, 7 or 8 months earlier and the suggestion was that mukhtiar kaur had been killed by the appellant with his licensed gun and he had thereafter attempted to commit suicide.\nafter completion of the investigation at the spot, mukhtiar kaur's dead body was sent for its post-mortem examination.\nit was found that mukhtiar kaur had two gunshot injuries on her dead body, a wound of entry on the back of right side of chest 2 cm x 1 cm with margining  and blackening and a corresponding exit wound of 5 cm x 3.5 cm to the front of the right side of the chest.\nsemen was found on the swab taken from the vagina and from the underwear that mukhtiar kaur had been wearing at the time of her death.\nthe weapon and the recovered cartridge cases had also been sent to the forensic science laboratory which in its report opined that the crime cartridge case ci 'could' have been fired by the right barrel of the weapon whereas the crime cartridge case c2 'had been' fired from the right barrel.\nthe  statement of the accused was recorded u/s. 313 of the cr.p.c.\n\nARGUMENT\nthere was absolutely no evidence to suggest that mukhtiar kaur had been subjected to rape.\nthere were no eye witnesses to the incident and the 4 witnesses i.e. jora singh and others who had reached the place of incident and carried the injured appellant to the hospital had also resiled and as the prosecution story now rested on circumstantial evidence alone, it was imperative for the investigating officer to have taken the finger prints from the weapon and that in any case the recovery of the spent cartridges and the gun were clearly suspicious as the weapon had been sent to the laboratory after an inordinate delay.\nin a case of attempted suicide a firearm must of necessity be used from a very close range and the absence of any blackening, charring or burning around the wound on ujjagar singh clearly ruled out the possibility of such an attempt.\nthe land had been transferred in the name of ujjagar singh's sons in the year 1994 by gurmail kaur, mother of mukhtiar kaur by a collusive decree and there was no evidence to show that mukhtiar kaur had ever displayed any unhappiness or made any complaint to any person or any

chemical examiner's reports that the vaginal swab and clothes taken from the dead body did indicate the presence of semen.\nthere is however absolutely no evidence to suggest (even assuming that the intercourse had been committed by the appellant) that he had done so without mukhtiar kaur's consent or against her will.\nthe investigators had made no attempt whatsoever to have the appellant medically examined to ascertain his capacity to perform sexual intercourse.\nwhether a chain is complete or not would depend on the facts of each case emanating from the evidence and no universal yardstick should ever be attempted.\na few facts stand out from the prosecution story.\nfirst, the place of incident being adjoining rooms in the residential house of the appellant and the fact that the alleged murder weapon is his licensed dbbl gun is proved on record.\nthe evidence also reveals that the appellant was living in the premises along with his wife, mother and son, and two daughters, who were studying outside the village, were frequent visitors, but it is the admitted position that nobody but the appellant and the deceased were present at the time of incident.\nit is also clear from the evidence that the two spent cartridge cases recovered, one from near mukhtiar kaur's dead body, and the second from the right barrel of the gun lying near the appellant had been sent to the forensic science laboratory which opined that one of the cartridges had been fired from the gun and the other could have been fired therefrom.\nin a case relating to circumstantial evidence motive does assume great importance but to say that the absence of motive would dislodge the entire prosecution story is perhaps giving this one factor an importance which is not due and (to use the clichi. the motive is in the mind of the accused and can seldom be fathomed with any degree of accuracy.\nthere is however a hint in the testimony of inspector harjinder pal singh that his enquiries had revealed that the accused was having illicit relations with mukhtiar kaur and the court can assume that something untoward had happened which could have triggered the volatile and hostile incident.\nthere could perhaps be some truth in this suggestion, as it is significant that though the appellant had an extended family living with him i.e. mother, wife, son living (in the village) and two young daughters who were studying outside and residing in a hostel, but were frequent visitors home, yet none of them has come forth to depose in his favour.\nthe shot had apparently travelled upwards skirting the mandible, through the flesh of the cheek in an upward direction with minimal damage to the bone structure and it is indeed providential that the appellant got away with only an injury, albeit a very serious one.\nthe fact that the shot was fired from below going upwards is also supported by the site plan exhibit pjj wherein marks of a shot hitting the roof were seen at point e whereas the appellant was found lying at point d in the same room.\nit is therefore apparent that the weapon had indeed been fired by the appellant from a close range and that the blackened portion around the wound had been removed.\nit is generally for the prosecution to prove its case beyond doubt but in circumstances such as the present one, some explanation is also due from an accused in order to absolve himself from suspicion of the crime.\nno part of the evidence of the hostile witnesses comes to the aid of the appellant.\nthe question now arises as to the sentence that should be imposed on the appellant.\nit would be seen that both the sessions court and the high court were appalled by the allegations and findings of incestuous rape and murder.\nthe court is however of the opinion, as already noted above, that a case of rape has not been made out.\nin this background the death sentence is not called for.\n\nSTATUTE\nsection 376, 309 of ipc\n\n", "doc_id":

restrained from alienating the other properties in her possession.\nan ad interim injunction was issued by the high court restraining the widow from alienating the properties in her possession and

orders that the trade name \"meghraj\" was in the form of a logo printed on the wrapper of the biscuits and,therefore,the appellants were not entitled to the benefit of notification.\nconsequently,the

amounting to rs.92,992.\naggrieved by the decision of the adjudicating authority,the assessee preferred appeals to the commissioner (a).\nthe said appeals were rejected on the ground that the

that there was widespread student prospects against starting new colleges and it was necessary to be cautious in the matter of starting new engineering colleges.\ngovernment could not initially take a

years.\n\"promissory estoppel\" is defined in black's law distionary as \"an estoppel which arises when there is a promise which promissor should reasonable expect to induce action or forbearance of a definite and substantial character on the part of promisee, and which does include such action or forbearance, and such promise is binding if injustice can be avoided only by enforcement of promise\".\nin central london property trust ltd. v. high trees house ltd., [1947] 1 k.b. 130 (high trees case) , the principle stated is that, where one party has, by his words or conduct, made to the other a promise or assurance which was intended to affect the legal relations between them and to be acted on accordingly, then, once the other party has taken him at his word and acted on it, the party who gave the promise or assurance cannot afterwards be allowed to revert to the previous legal relationship as if no such promise or assurance had been made by him, but he must accept their

indlaw sc 2183 it was held that the doctrine of promissory estoppel represents a principle evolved by equity to avoid injustice.\na person may have a 'legitimate expectation' of being treated in a certain way by an administrative authority even though he has no legal right in private law to receive such treatment.\nthe expectation may arise either from a representation or promise made by the authority, including an implied representation, or from consistent past practice.\nthe doctrine of legitimate expectation has an important place in the developing law of judicial review.\nit is, however, not necessary to explore the doctrine in this case, it is enough merely to note that a legitimate expectation can provide a sufficient interest to enable one who cannot point to the existence of a substantive right to obtain the leave of the court to apply for judicial review.\nit is generally agreed that 'legitimate expectation' gives the applicant sufficient locus standi for judicial review and that the doctrine of legitimate expectation to be confined mostly to right to a fair hearing before a decision which results in negativing a promise or withdrawing an undertaking is taken.\nthe doctrine does not give scope to claim relief straightway from the administrative authorities as no crystallized right as such involved.\nthe protection of such legitimate expectation does not require the fulfilment of the expectation where an overriding public interest requires otherwise.\nthe basic requirement of article 14 is fairness in action by the state, and non-arbitrariness in essence and substance is the heart beat of fair play.\nactions are amenable, in the panorama of judicial review only to the extent that the state must act validity for discernible reasons, not whimsically for any ulterior purpose.\nthe meaning and true import and concept of arbitrariness is more easily visualized than precisely defined.\na question whether the impugned action is arbitrary or not is to be ultimately answered on the facts and circumstances of a given case.\na basic and obvious test to apply in such cases is to see whether there is any discernible principle emerging from the impugned action and if so, does if really satisfy the test of reasonableness.\nevery state action must be informed by reason and it follows that an act uninformed by reason is per se arbitrary.\nsomething overwhelming must appear before the court will intervene.\nthat is and ought to be a difficult onus for an applicant to discharge.\nthere is ample room within the legal boundaries for radical differences of opinion in which neither side is unreasonable.\nthe reasonableness in administrative law must, therefore, distinguish between proper course and improper abuse of power.\nnor is the test court's own standard of reasonableness as it might conceive it in a given situation.\nthe point to note is that the thing is not unreasonable in the legal sense merely because

is that an offer is not accepted by mere silence on the part of the offerree,yet it does not mean that an acceptance always has to be given in so many words.\nunder certain circumstances,offerree s

consistent stand that since the hired vessel had not been re-delivered at the end of the time charter party,the vessel would be governed by the terms and conditions in the charter party dated 6th

the vessel in terms of the cl.4.1 and 23 would by itself be a dispute arising under the said charter party .with respect, the learned arbitral tribunal overlooked this aspect of the matter.\n\nSTATUTE\nit would be appropriate to refer to cls.4 and 23 of the charter party.\nthese are in the following terms: delivery & redelivery.\n4.1-the vessel shall continue to be on charter to
