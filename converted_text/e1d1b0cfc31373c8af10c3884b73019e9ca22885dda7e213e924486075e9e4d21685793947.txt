We have conferred with the corpus in  camera exhaustively,
wherein  she  has  indicated  that  though  she  went  with  the

of know that he was already married, now she wants to be with
her family/maternal uncle, with whom she was already staying
and does not want to go with the petitioner.
5.
In view of above fact situation, wherein the corpus wants to
be with her maternal uncle and not with the petitioner, no further
orders are required to be passed in the present petition, the same
is, therefore, dismissed, leaving it open for the petitioner to take
appropriate proceedings in accordance with law.
