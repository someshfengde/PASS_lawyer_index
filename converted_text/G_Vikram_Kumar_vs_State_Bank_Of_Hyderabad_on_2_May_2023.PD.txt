M. R. Shah, J.
1. Feeling aggrieved and dissatisfied with the Signature Not Verified impugned judgment and order
dated Digitally signed by R Natarajan Date: 2023.05.02 16:43:16 IST Reason:
Civil Appeal Nos. 3152−3153 of 2023 08.09.2017 passed by the High Court of Judicature at
Hyderabad for the State of Telangana and Andhra Pradesh passed in Writ Petition No.31098 of
2016 and the subsequent order dated 08.12.2017 passed in Review Petition No.45031 of 2017 in
Writ Petition No.31098 of 2016, the appellant and the auction purchaser has preferred the present
appeals.
2. The facts leading to the present appeals in nutshell are as under:
2.1 That the respondent no.3 herein – builder had taken loan from respondent no.2 – Bank for the
development of the multi−storey housing project. That the respondent no.3 (hereinafter referred to
as the borrower) was not able to Civil Appeal Nos. 3152−3153 of 2023 repay the security interest to
the Bank, the Bank initiated proceedings against the borrower under Section 13 of the Securitization
and Reconstruction of Financial Assets and Enforcement of Security Interest Act, 2002 (hereinafter
referred to as ‘the SARFAESI Act, 2002). The Bank attached the properties of the borrower under
Section 13(4) of the SARFAESI Act. Against the measures taken by the Bank under Section 13(4) of
the SARFAESI Act, the borrower filed S.A. No.253 of 2012 before the Debt Recovery Tribunal
(DRT), Hyderabad. S.A. No.253 of 2012 was listed before the DRT on 19.02.2016, when the

borrower was given liberty to file a list of intending buyers of the property and bring forth with the
buyers so as Civil Appeal Nos. 3152−3153 of 2023 to enable the Tribunal to consider the same for
the repayment of the dues of the Bank. On 25.02.2016, the DRT passed an order permitting the
Bank to go ahead with the sale as proposed excluding flat to be identified and communicated by the
borrower to the Bank by 29.02.2016 with full details of all purchasers to the bank officials on
affidavit so as to enable the bank officer to exclude those flats, provided the remaining flats are
sufficient for recovery of the dues. The Tribunal directed that the bank may proceed with the sale
but shall not confirm the sale till the next date of hearing. At this stage it is required to be noted that
the aforesaid order was passed by the Tribunal in view of the submissions made by the borrower
Civil Appeal Nos. 3152−3153 of 2023 that he had sold seven flats out of 37 flats which were to be
sold by the Bank to some third persons. Flat No.6401 – flat in question was not amongst the said
seven flats. 2.2 A Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) was entered into between the respondent
no.1 and the borrower with respect to the sale of Flat No.6401 on 10.04.2016 for a lumpsum
consideration of Forty−five lakhs. It is pertinent to note that in the MoU itself there was a reference
to some proceedings going on before the DRT and that the Bank and the borrower will obtain
clearance in order to process the agreement to sale. That an agreement to sale was executed between
the bank and the borrower for a sale of Flat No.6401 on Civil Appeal Nos. 3152−3153 of 2023
16.06.2016. At this stage, it is required to be noted that the said agreement to sale was executed by
the borrower without informing/obtaining any consent from the DRT as well as the Bank and the
permission, if any, given to the borrower earlier obtained only to the seven flats which were already
recognized by the DRT on 25.02.2016.
2.3 That thereafter the Bank issued a public notice on 28.07.2016 for auctioning the properties of
the borrower. The said notice was published in the newspaper on 29.07.2016. The property in
question, i.e. Flat No.6401 was also subjected to auction. It was placed in Lot No.1 for which the e−
auction was proposed on 30.08.2016. Civil Appeal Nos. 3152−3153 of 2023 2.4 The borrower filed
an application before the DRT praying for stay on all proceedings of the Bank pursuant to the
auction notice dated 28.07.2016. On 24.08.2016 the DRT was pleased to reject the application for
stay filed by the borrower. While rejecting the stay application and refusing to grant the stay as
prayed, the DRT observed as under:
“…Pending the decision, this Tribunal has directed to sell the property and the
Applicant now has entered into an agreement to be sold for some other flats. This is
utter violation of the SARFAESI action as also the direction of the Tribunal.” “7. As
stated hereinabove, it is also question of great concern that the Applicant has entered
into an agreement with third party in respect of few other flats i.e. Flat No.3202,
6401, 7101, 7202 and 3201 without the permission of the Respondent Bank or this
Tribunal.
Hence, any such transaction is declared as void.” Civil Appeal Nos. 3152−3153 of 2023 2.5 That
thereafter e−auction was conducted by the Bank on 31.08.2016 in which the appellant also
participated. The appellant was declared as a successful bidder with respect to Flat No.6401 in Lot
No.1. Accordingly, he made a payment of 25% of the bid amount i.e. Rs.6,45,250/−. The Bank also
issued a confirmation receipt to the appellant on 31.08.2016.

2.6 That thereafter the respondent no.1 filed a Writ Petition No.31098 of 2016 before the High Court
on 14.09.2016 challenging the e−auction notice dated 28.07.2016 to the extent it concerns Flat
No.6401. The said writ petition was filed much after the auction was complete and the appellant was
declared as a successful Civil Appeal Nos. 3152−3153 of 2023 bidder. The respondent no.1 did not
disclose in the writ petition that the auction has already taken place. The appellant herein was also
not made party. By impugned judgment and order dated 15.09.2016 the High Court stayed the
auction qua Flat No.6401 as notified under the e−auction sale notice subject to respondent no.1
(original wit petitioner) paying to the bank not less than 25.81 lakhs before the scheduled date and
time of the auction, failing which, the Bank shall be free to proceed with the auction. The Bank
issued a letter to the appellant dated 20.09.2016 stating that the High Court has stayed the auction
proceedings with respect to Flat No.6401 and that the respondent no.1 Civil Appeal Nos. 3152−3153
of 2023 herein has paid the amount to the Bank as directed by the High Court.
2.7 On becoming aware of the pending proceedings in Writ Petition No.31098 of 2016 the appellant
herein filed an application for getting impleaded in the said writ petition and filed the counter
affidavit. In the counter affidavit it was specifically stated that the DRT has declared the agreement
of sale executed between the respondent no.1 and the borrower as void and that the appellant is the
successful auction purchaser and that the respondent no.1 had not disclosed the complete and
correct facts of the case. It was also stated that the right, if any, available to the respondent no.1
(original writ petitioner) would have been under Section Civil Appeal Nos. 3152−3153 of 2023 17 of
the SARFAESI Act and not the writ petition filed by him. It was also stated that the respondent no.1
had not informed the Court that the auction proceedings were already over at the time when the stay
order was passed. The Bank also filed the counter affidavit in the writ petition seeking dismissal of
the writ petition primarily on the ground that an alternative remedy under Section 17 of the
SARFAESI Act was available. The High Court allowed the impleadment application. Despite the
above, by the impugned judgment and order the High Court has allowed the writ petition filed by
respondent no.1 herein. That thereafter the appellant herein the auction purchaser filed the review
petition which has Civil Appeal Nos. 3152−3153 of 2023 been dismissed by the High Court. Hence,
against the final decision of the High Court in the main writ petition allowing the same in favour of
the respondent no.1 herein and rejecting the review application filed by the appellant, the appellant
– successful auction purchaser has preferred the present appeals.
3. Shri A. Sirajudeen, learned Senior Advocate has appeared on behalf of the appellant. Shri Buddy
A. Ranganadhan, learned counsel has appeared on behalf of respondent no.1 – original writ
petitioner and Shri Ananga Bhattacharyya, learned counsel has appeared on behalf of respondent
no.3.
Civil Appeal Nos. 3152−3153 of 2023
4. Shri A. Sirajudeen, learned Senior counsel appearing on behalf of the appellant has made the
following submissions:
(i) That the High Court has materially erred in entertaining the writ petition filed by respondent no.1
which was against the steps taken by the Bank under Section 13(4) of the SARFAESI Act namely
G. Vikram Kumar vs State Bank Of Hyderabad on 2 May, 2023
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/126147244/
3
against e−auction notice;
(ii) That the respondent no.1 being the agreement to sale holder had no right title in the flat in
question and therefore could not have filed the writ petition challenging e−auction notice on the
basis of the agreement to sale in his favour;
Civil Appeal Nos. 3152−3153 of 2023
(iii) Even if the respondent no.1 had any right, if any, in that case also he had alternative efficacious
statutory remedy available under Section 17 of the SARFAESI Act challenging the e−auction notice;
(iv) That there was suppression of material facts on the part of respondent no.1 which was
specifically pointed out by the appellant in the counter affidavit that at the time when the writ
petition was filed and the interim relief was obtained the auction had taken place in which the
appellant was declared the successful bidder;
(v) That in fact the DRT in the earlier order dated 24.08.2016 declared the sale Civil Appeal Nos.
3152−3153 of 2023 agreement in favour of the respondent no.1 by the borrower as void as the same
was entered into without prior permission of the DRT or even the Bank; and
(vi) The High Court has materially erred in relying upon Section 13(8) of the SARFAESI Act.
4.1 It is further submitted by learned counsel appearing on behalf of the appellant that the High
Court has not properly appreciated the fact that a sale agreement holder cannot seek redemption of
a property under Section 91 of the Transfer of Property Act, 1882 and cannot be treated at par with
an auction−sale purchaser under Section 54 of the Transfer of Property Act makes it clear that no
interest Civil Appeal Nos. 3152−3153 of 2023 /charge is created upon a property only by way of
sale−agreement. It is stated that in fact the impugned judgment passed by the High Court that the
respondent no.1 be able to seek redemption of the subject property which was attached by the Bank.
It is submitted that the bank attached the property as against the borrower and the respondent No.1
was only the sale−agreement holder. It is submitted that as such by virtue of the impugned
judgment and order, the High Court has granted the decree for specific performance of the
agreement to sale which is not permissible while exercising the powers under Article 226 of the
Constitution of India.
Civil Appeal Nos. 3152−3153 of 2023 4.2 It is further submitted by learned counsel appearing on
behalf of the appellant that the High Court has materially erred in observing that the equity would
be in favour of respondent no. 1 as he has deposited the entire amount as directed. It is submitted
that the High Court has materially erred in observing that if the sale is confirmed the respondent
no.1 will suffer greater hardship and if the sale is not confirmed at the most, the appellant may lose
interest on Rs.6,45,250/−.
4.3 It is further submitted that as such there is no clarity in the impugned judgment and order
passed by the High Court on what exact relief the High Court has granted except observing that the

writ petition is allowed. Civil Appeal Nos. 3152−3153 of 2023
5. While opposing the present appeal learned counsel appearing on behalf of the respondent no.1
has vehemently submitted that in the present case Section 13(8) of the SARFAESI Act shall be
applicable and therefore when the respondent no.1 being the agreement to sale holder of the flat in
question agreed to pay/deposit the entire sale consideration the High Court has not committed any
error in entertaining the writ petition under Article 226 of the Constitution of India challenging the
e− auction notice.
5.1 It is submitted that as soon as respondent no.1 came to know that the flat in question which was
agreed to be sold in favour of respondent no.1 for which part consideration was paid is Civil Appeal
Nos. 3152−3153 of 2023 put to auction, immediately he filed the writ petition showing his
inclination to deposit the entire amount of sale consideration which is permissible under Section
13(8) of the SARFAESI Act. It is submitted that the object and purpose of Section 13(8) of the
SARFAESI Act is to save the property from auction in case the borrower and/or the person
interested in the property agrees to clear the dues. 5.2 It is submitted that in the present case at the
relevant time there was no concluded sale in favour of the appellant, as at the relevant time the
appellant deposited only 25% of the auction sale consideration. It is submitted that as per the catena
of decisions unless the full sale consideration is paid; the sale deed is executed Civil Appeal Nos.
3152−3153 of 2023 and/or the sale certificate is issued in favour of the auction purchaser there is no
concluded sale. It is submitted that if the sale is not concluded, Section 13(8) of the SARFAESI Act
shall be applicable and/or can be invoked. In support of his submissions, he has relied upon the
decisions of this Court in the case of Mathew Varghese v. M. Amritha Kumar, (2014) 5 SCC 610
(para 38); Narandas Karsondas vs. S.A. Kamtam, (1977) 3 SCC 247; B. Arvind Kumar vs. Govt. of
India & Ors., (2007) 5 SCC 745 (para 12). He has also relied upon the decision of the Punjab and
Haryana High Court in the case of Pal Alloys & Metal India Pvt. Ltd. & Ors. vs. Civil Appeal Nos.
3152−3153 of 2023 Allahabad Bank & Ors., 2021 SCC OnLine P&H 2733 as well as the decision of
the Andhra Pradesh High Court in the case of M/s India Finlease Securities Ltd. vs. Prasad Indian
Overseas Bank, 2012 SCC OnLine AP
205. 5.3 It is further submitted by learned counsel appearing on behalf of the respondent no.1 that
the respondent no.1 has subsequently died and his heirs including the widow are residing in the flat
in question since long and that they have paid/deposited the entire sale consideration and therefore
if now the appeal is allowed in that case, they have to vacate the premises which will not be
equitable. Civil Appeal Nos. 3152−3153 of 2023 Therefore, it is prayed to dismiss the present appeal.
6. Learned counsel appearing on behalf of the Bank has though opposed the writ petition before the
High Court, has stated that whatever the decision, the Bank shall abide by the same.
7. Heard learned counsel appearing on behalf of the respective parties at length.
8. At the outset, it is required to be noted that what was challenged before the High Court by
respondent no.1 in a writ petition under Article 226 of the Constitution of India was the e− auction
notice which was pursuant to the action initiated by the Bank in exercise of powers under Section
G. Vikram Kumar vs State Bank Of Hyderabad on 2 May, 2023

13(4) of the SARFAESI Act. At this stage it is required to be noted that Civil Appeal Nos. 3152−3153
of 2023 e−auction was held/conducted on 31.08.2016 in which the appellant participated and was
declared as a successful bidder and he made a payment of 25% of the bid amount on the very day
i.e., on 31.08.2016. However, thereafter the respondent no.1 filed the writ petition before the High
Court challenging the e−auction notice dated 28.07.2016 on 14.09.2016 that is after conducting of
the auction. It is required to be noted that against any steps taken by the Bank under Section 13(4)
of the SARFAESI Act the aggrieved party has a remedy under the SARFAESI Act by way of appeal
under Section 17 of the SARFAESI Act to approach the DRT. Therefore, in view of the availability of
the alternative statutory remedy available by way of Civil Appeal Nos. 3152−3153 of 2023
proceedings/appeal under Section 17 of the SARFAESI Act, the High Court ought not to have
entertained the writ petition under Article 226 of the Constitution of India in which the e− auction
notice was under challenge. Therefore, the High Court has committed a very serious error in
entertaining the writ petition under Article 226 of the Constitution of India challenging the e−
auction notice issued by the Bank in exercise of power under Section 13(4) of the SARFAESI Act.
8.1 Even otherwise it is required to be noted that the respondent no.1 – original writ petitioner filed
the writ petition as agreement to sale holder of the flat in question. At this stage it is required to be
noted that earlier against the Civil Appeal Nos. 3152−3153 of 2023 measures taken by the Bank
under Section 13(4) of the SARFAESI Act the borrower filed S.A.No.253 of 2012 before the DRT,
Hyderabad. The DRT, Hyderabad by order dated 19.12.2016 gave the liberty to the borrower to file
the list of intending buyers of the property and to bring forth with the buyers so as to enable the
Tribunal to consider the same for repayment of the dues of the Bank. That thereafter on 25.02.2016
the DRT passed the following order:
"The Bank is directed to go ahead with the sale as proposed excluding the Flat to be
identified and communicated by the Applicant to the Respondent Bank by
29.02.2016 with full detailed of all the Purchasers to the Bank Officers on affidavit so
as to enable the Bank Officer to exclude those Flats, provided the remaining Flats are
sufficient for recovery of the dues. The Bank may proceed with Civil Appeal Nos.
3152−3153 of 2023 the sale but shall not confirm the same till the next date of
hearing."
8.2 At this stage it is required to be noted that the flat in question namely Flat No.6401 was not the
seven flats identified by the borrower to be kept out of the auction proceedings. At the relevant time
the flat in question was not sold amongst the seven flats mentioned before the Tribunal. That
thereafter during the pendency of the S.A. No.253 of 2012 and without obtaining prior approval
and/or intimation to the DRT and even the bank, the borrower entered into the sale agreement with
the respondent no.1 on 16.06.2016. At this stage, it is required to be noted that in the MoU dated
10.04.2016 between the borrower and the respondent no.1 in Clause No.4 it was Civil Appeal Nos.
3152−3153 of 2023 specifically provided that first the party should obtain clearance of sale from
DRT/SBH so that they can process with further agreement to sale. Thus, as such respondent no.1 at
the relevant time was aware about the pending DRT proceedings. Still the respondent no.1 entered
into the agreement to sale with the borrower on 16.06.2016. At this stage, it is pertinent to note that
thereafter when the Bank issued a public notice on 28.07.2016 for auctioning the properties of the
G. Vikram Kumar vs State Bank Of Hyderabad on 2 May, 2023

borrower. Before the date of auction, on 24.08.2016 the borrower filed an application before the
DRT praying for stay of all proceedings of the Bank pursuant to the auction notice dated 28.07.2016.
The DRT was pleased to reject the Civil Appeal Nos. 3152−3153 of 2023 said application for stay vide
the order dated 24.08.2016 by observing that the sale of the flat in question without the permission
of the Bank or the Tribunal is void. The order dated 24.08.2016 is reproduced hereinabove. Thus, as
such the transaction in favour of the respondent no.1 with respect to Flat no.6401 was already held
to be void by the DRT. That thereafter, after the borrower having failed to obtain any order, the
respondent no.1 had straightway filed the writ petition challenging the e−auction notice which the
borrower failed to get any relief before the DRT. If the respondent no.1 would have approached the
DRT against the e−auction notice he would have been non−suited in view of the earlier Civil Appeal
Nos. 3152−3153 of 2023 order passed by the DRT dated 24.08.2016.
Therefore, calculatively the respondent no.1 filed the writ petition before the High Court challenging
the e−auction notice and that too after conducting of the e−auction on 31.08.2016 and the sale in
favour of the appellant was confirmed. The aforesaid facts were pointed out before the High Court
and despite the same the High Court has allowed the writ petition which is not sustainable at all. By
the impugned order the respondent no.1 has got the relief which as such the borrower failed to get
from the DRT. On the aforesaid grounds the impugned judgment and order passed by the High
Court is unsustainable. Civil Appeal Nos. 3152−3153 of 2023 8.3 Even otherwise it is very debatable
whether Section 13(8) of the SARFAESI Act shall be applicable in favour of a person who is only an
agreement to sale holder or Section 13(8) of the SARFAESI Act shall be applicable only in case of the
borrower who is ready and willing to pay the entire debt. In the present case the borrower failed to
get any relief from the DRT. The borrower did not apply and/or invoke Section 13(8) and did not
agree to clear the entire dues. Therefore, also the High Court has materially erred in allowing the
writ petition. 8.4 Even otherwise it is required to be noted that as such what exact relief is granted
by the High Court is not clear. The High Court has simply stated that the writ petition is allowed.
Civil Appeal Nos. 3152−3153 of 2023 However, it is required to be noted that what was challenged
before the High Court was the e−auction notice dated 28.07.2016 which was already conducted on
31.08.2016. Therefore, the writ petition was filed much after conducting the e−auction on
31.08.2016. No consequential relief has been granted by the High Court. Therefore, also the
impugned judgment and order passed by the High Court is unsustainable.
8.5 Now so far as the submission on behalf of the respondent no.1 that the respondent no.1 has
paid/deposited the amount of sale consideration and now the respondent no.1 has died his heirs will
have to vacate the flat in question and on the other hand the appellant Civil Appeal Nos. 3152−3153
of 2023 shall be entitled to return the amount of Rs.6,45,250/− deposited at the relevant time being
25% of the auction sale consideration with interest is concerned, at the outset it is required to be
noted that as such the transaction between the respondent no.1 and the borrower pursuant to the
agreement to sale dated 16.06.2016 was absolutely illegal and behind the back of the Tribunal as
well as the Bank and during the pendency of the proceedings before the Tribunal. In order dated
24.08.2016 the Tribunal had in fact already held the sale transaction as void. As observed
hereinabove even at the time when the respondent no.1 entered into the agreement to sale/MoU he
was aware about the Civil Appeal Nos. 3152−3153 of 2023 proceedings pending before the DRT
which is apparent from Clause 4 of the MoU referred to hereinabove. Therefore, respondent no.1

7
and/or his heirs cannot be permitted to get the benefit of his own wrong and cannot be permitted to
get the benefit of a void transaction.
9. In view of the above and for the reasons stated above, the impugned judgment and order passed
by the High Court is hereby quashed and set aside. It is directed that on the full payment of the
auction sale consideration by the appellant (after deducting the 25% of the amount already
deposited earlier) with 9% interest from the date of auction till the actual amount is paid, to be paid
within a period of Civil Appeal Nos. 3152−3153 of 2023 four weeks from today, the sale certificate be
issued in favour of the appellant with respect to Flat No.6401. Whatever the amount is already
deposited by the respondent no.1/his heirs shall be returned to the respondent no.1 (now his heirs)
with the interest at 9% from the date of such deposit till the actual date of return which shall be
returned within a period of four weeks from today. The heirs of original respondent no.1 are granted
three months’ time to vacate the flat in question and are directed to hand over the peaceful and
vacant possession of the Flat No.6401 to the appellant within a period of three months from today as
ordered above.
Civil Appeal Nos. 3152−3153 of 2023 Present appeals are allowed. However, in the facts and
circumstances of the case there shall be no order as to costs.
