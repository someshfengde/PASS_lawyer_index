2. The following issues arise for consideration in the present appeals :
Signature Not Verified Digitally signed by Narendra Prasad Date: 2023.05.19
1) Whether non-recording of a disclosure statement 18:18:44 IST Reason: of the appellant in the
language in which it is made and recording of the same in a language totally unknown to the
appellant, contents whereof are also not read over and explained to him, can be said to have caused
any prejudice to the cause of justice?
2) Whether DNA evidence can form the solitary basis in determining the guilt of the appellant?
3) Whether the circumstances as identified and relied on by the prosecution indeed point to the guilt
only of the appellant, closing out any and all other possibilities of any other person?

3. Pursuant to FIR No.109/2010 dated 12.6.2010 registered at P.S. Bhayander (Thane,
Maharashtra), the appellant Prakash Nishad @ Kewat Zinak Nishad was charged for having
committed an offence punishable under Sections 376, 377, 302 and 201 of the Indian Penal Code,
1860 (‘IPC’ for short). The Trial Court vide judgment dated 27.11.2014 rendered in Sessions Case
No.407/2010, convicted the accused in connection with all the offences and imposed capital
punishment for the charge under Section 302 IPC and sentence of imprisonment for other offences.
Hereinbelow is a tabular representation of the sentences as imposed by the Trial Court:
S.No. Statutory provision Imposition of Sentence on the Appellant under the Indian
Penal Code, 1860
1. Section 376 Life imprisonment and fine of Rs. 1,000.
In default, rigorous imprisonment for a time period of 3 months.
2. Section 377 Life imprisonment and fine of Rs. 1000.
In default, rigorous imprisonment for a time period of 3 months.
3. Section 302 Death Penalty and fine of Rs. 3,000. In default, rigorous
imprisonment for a time period of 9 months.
4. Section 201 Rigorous imprisonment for 7 years and fine of Rs. 1,000. In default,
rigorous imprisonment for a time period of 3 months.
4. Such findings of fact and conviction, including that of the death sentence imposed were affirmed
by the High Court of Bombay, being the first Court of Appeal in both the proceedings. The reference
was also answered in terms of common judgment dated 13-14.10.2015 rendered in Criminal Appeal
No.88/2015 and Criminal Confirmation Case No.4/2014.
Hence, the present appeals preferred by the appellant.
5. The courts below concurrently found the prosecution to have established the case beyond
reasonable doubt, i.e., the appellant after sexually assaulting a minor girl (aged six years) put her to
death. Also, in an attempt to destroy the evidence threw her into a ‘nala’ (drain) and concealed
material evidence of crime.
6. At the threshold, we may point out that it is a case of circumstantial evidence, as none has
witnessed the crime for which the appellant stands charged for. The prosecution case is primarily
based, not on ocular evidence but on the confessional statement of the appellant leading to the
recovery of incriminating articles and through scientific analysis establishing his guilt. The
sheet-anchor of the case being the DNA analysis report stating the semen of the appellant found on
the undergarments of the prosecutrix (nicker) and the vaginal smear slide of the prosecutrix.

8. The prosecutrix was born from the wedlock of PW 1 and PW 2 and at the time of occurrence of the
incident, i.e., on 11.6.2010, she was just 6 years of age. Neither her identity, nor the fact that she died
as a result of major ante-mortem injuries, is in dispute.
9. Dr. Anjali Pimple (PW 4), who examined the body of the prosecutrix, has testified to the factum of
the post-mortem conducted by her and preparation of medical report (Ext.28) thereof. As a witness
on oath, she has deposed that the prosecutrix suffered multiple injuries (15 in total) on her body,
including on both of her private parts. Undoubtedly such injuries are severe, serious and grievous in
nature. Thus, the prosecution has established the case of homicidal death beyond any doubt.
10. The question which arises for consideration is: as to who committed the dastardly crime? Was it
only the appellant or someone else?
11. For ascertaining such fact, we now proceed to examine the prosecution case as set out in different
stages, be it investigation or trial.
12. The FIR dated 12.6.2010 (Ext.44), so registered on the complaint of PW 1 (Ext.19 which forms
part of Ext.1), records that in the morning of 12th June, 2010 the dead body of the prosecutrix was
found floating in the Nala, in close proximity to her house. She had been sexually assaulted and
killed by an “unidentified person”, after which the body was thrown into the nala with the objective
of destruction of evidence of such assault.
13. Significantly, none is suspected at this stage. The said FIR was recorded by Police Officer - PW
11. The investigation consequent thereto was conducted by three people – PW 6, PW 12, and PW 13.
14. PW 6 (the 1st Investigating Officer) in the presence of Panch Witnesses – PW 9 and PW 10,
recovered the body of the prosecutrix and sent it for post-mortem, which was conducted by PW 4.
This Investigating Officer only conducted the spot search. His role ends here.
15. Thereafter, PW 12 (the 2nd Investigating Officer) based on certain inputs (not disclosed),
arrested the appellant from his workplace on 13.6.2010 and searched his house in the presence of
two independent witnesses, namely, PW 5 and Piyush Ramesh Kumar Jain (not examined). The
search resulted in recovery of certain incriminating articles vide memo Ext.35. The appellant was in
no manner associated with such a search.
16. Thereafter, further investigation was entrusted to PW 13 - the Deputy Commissioner of Police
(the third Investigating Officer), who, on the basis of disclosure statement of the appellant,
conducted the search at two places, including the house of the appellant previously searched on
13.6.2010. Such searches were conducted on 16th and 17th of June, 2010, leading to the recovery of
Prakash Nishad @ Kewat Zinak ... vs The State Of Maharashtra on 19 May, 2023

certain incriminating articles linking the appellant to the crime, which stood established in DNA
reports (Ext.85 & 86) prepared by the forensic experts through scientific analysis. The Investigating
Officer found tell-tale signs of the appellant in the shape of stains of his semen, on the vaginal smear
slide of the prosecutrix and blood stains of the prosecutrix on the banian (vest) of the appellant,
linking the appellant to the crime. As such, on completion of the investigation, a challan was
presented in the Court for trial.
17. In the aforesaid backdrop, we now proceed to examine the testimonies of the witnesses as
categorized above.
18. On oath, PW 1, (father of the prosecutrix) categorically admits that he had not expressed any
doubt on any person for having caused the death of his daughter. He expressly stated that “I had no
doubt on any one about the death of my daughter”. He recognized the appellant who, according to
the said witness, lived in the same “chawl”. His testimony is indicative of the fact that on the evening
of 11.6.2010, his daughter (the prosecutrix), aged 6 years, after having dinner left home. Finding her
not to have returned home, he searched for her and found her to be dead, in a “gutter” near his
house. Later on, he states that prior to 14.6.2010, he had not suspected the appellant of having
committed the crime. Significantly, the date and the basis leading to such suspicion is not disclosed
by him.
19. Other aspects of his deposition, in particular, his statement with respect to the recovery of the
nicker shall be dealt with separately. He recognized the nicker (Article 10) to be that of his daughter.
20. PW 2, the mother of the prosecutrix, while corroborating the testimony of her husband, added
that till 14.6.2010 she was not aware as to who had assaulted and killed her daughter. However, in
Court, she testified to having given the appellant a match box, upon his request, in the early hours of
12.6.2010.
21. PW 3, while corroborating the version of PW 1 and PW 2, only added that finding the prosecutrix
not to have returned home, he thought that perhaps she had gone to the neighbour’s house to watch
television. On the morning of 12.6.2010, a neighbour - whom he does not name - informed PW 2 of
the dead body of the prosecutrix lying in a “gutter”.
22. It is to be noted that none of the relatives have disclosed either the complicity of the appellant in
the crime or the reason for their suspicion towards him, particularly on 14.6.2010 which was two
days after the incident.
23. The law on circumstantial evidence is well settled. When a case is governed by such evidence, the
evidence must point singularly to the guilt of the appellant, closing out the possibility of all other
hypotheses.
24. The locus classicus on the subject is Sharad Birdhichand Sarda v. State of Maharashtra1. A
recent judgement of this Court authored by one of us (Vikram Nath, J.) has highlighted the well
settled law on circumstantial evidence in Indrajit Das v. State of Tripura2, reiterating the golden
Prakash Nishad @ Kewat Zinak ... vs The State Of Maharashtra on 19 May, 2023
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/21033879/
5
principles, as under :
“10. The present one is a case of circumstantial evidence as no one has seen the
commission of crime. The law in the case of circumstantial evidence is well settled.
The leading case being Sharad Birdhichand Sarda v. State of Maharashtra.
According to it, the circumstances should be of a definite tendency unerringly pointing towards the
guilt of the 1 (1984) 4 SCC 116 2 2023 SCC OnLine SC 201 accused; the circumstances taken
cumulatively should form a chain so complete that there is no escape from the conclusion that
within all human probability the crime was committed by the accused and they should be incapable
of explanation on any hypothesis other than that of the guilt of the accused and inconsistent with his
innocence. The said principle set out in the case of Sharad Birdhichand Sarda (supra) has been
consistently followed by this Court. In a recent case - Sailendra Rajdev Pasvan v. State of Gujarat,
this Court observed that in a case of circumstantial evidence, law postulates two-fold requirements.
Firstly, that every link in the chain of circumstances necessary to establish the guilt of the accused
must be established by the prosecution beyond reasonable doubt and secondly, all the
circumstances must be consistent pointing out only towards the guilt of the accused. We need not
burden this judgment by referring to other judgments as the above principles have been consistently
followed and approved by this Court time and again.”
25. To establish the guilt of the appellant, the prosecution relies upon the following circumstances:
a) The appellant was residing in the same chawl as that of the prosecutrix;
b) Appellant was found near the scene of the crime;
c) The appellant made disclosure statements, i.e., dated 16.6.2010 Ext.47 and dated
17.6.2010 Ext.50, which led to the recovery of incriminating articles vide Memo Nos.
Ext.48 and Ext.51. from the house of the appellant and another place where he had
hidden the clothes belonging to him and the prosecutrix;
d) The DNA reports prepared on scientific analysis by an expert, establishing the
blood of the prosecutrix on banian of the appellant and his semen on the clothes of
prosecutrix and her vaginal smear slide.
26. Let us examine whether all these circumstances stand established by the prosecution or not.
Circumstance of 13 residing in the ‘chawl’ being seen at the spot of the crime
27. PW 1 and PW 2 stated that the appellant resided in the very same chawl as they, although they
did not identify his house. Well, that’s about all. There being no other evidence of he residing there.
Even if the version of the mother of having seen the appellant and giving him a matchbox, in the
early hours of 12.6.2010, is believed, the same does not advance the case of the prosecution any
Prakash Nishad @ Kewat Zinak ... vs The State Of Maharashtra on 19 May, 2023

further. The appellant was not found at the place where the alleged crime took place or the place
from where the body was recovered. The prosecution has not been able to establish the distance
between the two places - that of the crime and the place where the appellant was spotted in the
morning hours. There is no spot map or any ocular evidence to this effect. As noted above, what led
these witnesses to discover the appellant of having committed the crime has gone unstated. It is only
on the basis of the information furnished by PW 1, expressing his suspicion on the appellant, that he
was on 13.6.2010 arrested and the same day, his residence was searched. It is here that the major
contradiction, if not falsity, in the prosecution case emerges. The Investigating Officer PW 12 is
categorical of having suspected the appellant only on the basis of the information furnished by the
father of the prosecutrix, i.e., PW
1. PW 12 states that “the father of deceased expressed suspicion against the appellant and at the time
of his house search was taken.” and PW 1 states that “He did not suspect anyone prior to 14.6.2010.”
The search was conducted on 13th and not on 14th of June, 2010. He added that finding the house of
the appellant to be locked, he called the medical analyzer, Mumbai, whereafter, he, by breaking open
the lock of the house of the appellant, recovered incriminating articles vide Ext.36 on 13.6.2010 and
such articles being:
“Article 1 – Square cardboard;
Article 2 – Blanket;
Article 3 – Floor tiles pieces;
Article 4 – Mat;
Article 5 –Towel;
Article 6 –Spanner;
Article 7 –Hair found on pillow;
Article 8 – Mat; and Article 9 – Pillow”
28. Having conducted the search in the presence of PW 5 and Piyush Ramesh Kumar Jain
(unexamined), he locked and sealed the house. Out of the two, the prosecution examined only one
witness, namely PW 5. Perusal of the testimony of this witness as also the Investigating Officer and
the relatives of the prosecutrix, does not establish one major fact, that being, who actually identified
the house of the appellant.
29. A ‘chawl’ is a group of tenements clustered together, very small in size and densely populated.
It’s an inexpensive accommodation, temporary for some, permanent for others. Living in the same
chawl, cannot be, in the attending facts of no one having identified with certainty the exact
house/room of the appellant, a circumstance pointing to the guilt of the appellant. As is evident
Prakash Nishad @ Kewat Zinak ... vs The State Of Maharashtra on 19 May, 2023
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/21033879/
7
from the decisions referred (supra), for a circumstance to be established, there shouldn’t be doubt; it
should not leave room for the possibility that, not the appellant against whom the circumstance is
sought to be proved but someone else, may have done the said crime.
30. None of the witnesses have deposed that it was at the instance of the appellant that the
prosecutrix left the house, nor has anyone deposed to the effect of having seen the appellant and the
prosecutrix together at any point in time; Appellant was not even a visitor to the house of PW 1.
They have no relationship, be it of whatever nature. All that is stated is that after having dinner
prosecutrix left home, and PW 3 states that he thought she may have gone to the neighbour’s house
to watch TV. With this being the case, last seen theory, does not come into play. Although argued
before us, the Trial Court has correctly not considered the same to be a circumstance of
consequence, in either direction. The Circumstance Disclosure Statement of the appellant and the
Recovery of incriminating articles
31. Conjoint reading of the testimonies of PW 12 and PW 13 further renders the prosecution case to
be inherently improbable, if not self-contradictory and impossible on this circumstance.
32. Unlike PW 5, who is categorical about having seen the blood- stained nicker in the house of the
appellant, PW 12 does not disclose such fact. Undisputedly, both these witnesses together visited the
alleged house of the appellant only once, i.e., on 13.6.2010. It is a matter of record that police
recovered only one nicker belonging to the prosecutrix, which was recovered at the time of the
second search conducted on 16.6.2010, which renders the recovery by PW 13 in the presence of PW
9 to be extremely doubtful, specifically when the search and subsequent recovery of incriminating
articles is refuted.
33. There is yet another contradiction which bears significance in the attending facts and that being
the time of the seizure of the articles recovered during the first search. The Panchnama (Ext.
36) reveals that the same was prepared in the night of 13.6.2010 between 9.00 p.m. to 9.30 p.m.,
whereas according to PW 5, all proceedings of recovery appear to have been completed before 2.00
p.m. to 2.30 p.m. by which time the witness had returned home. In fact, the factum of search itself is
in doubt as PW 5 categorically states that after conducting the search he visited the police station
where his “signatures” were obtained, though, he clarifies that earlier too his signatures were taken,
but on what paper and for what purpose, he did not disclose.
34. We may now proceed to the testimony of PW 13, who is the star witness of the prosecution, i.e.,
the Investigating Officer. According to his version, on 16.6.2010, the appellant, while in police
custody, made a disclosure statement (Ext.47) in the presence of independent witnesses PW 7 and
P.K Mehta (not examined). The statement revealed the appellant to have concealed the nicker of the
prosecutrix as also his clothes, worn by him at the time of incident, in his house, which he was ready
to identify and get recovered.
35. Accordingly, on 16.6.2010 PW 13 along with the Panchas, staff and the appellant searched the
room No.39 of Ganesh Deval Nagar. The room was opened, and the appellant produced “amul gold
Prakash Nishad @ Kewat Zinak ... vs The State Of Maharashtra on 19 May, 2023
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/21033879/

45 size nicker” and one “white colour nicker of amul gold 80 cm’s size banian” having blood stains
and one “grey coloured barmuda” and one “brown colour nicker having contents written as Sophia
65 cm” and some blood stains. The said articles were seized vide Memo Ext.48 in the presence of the
Panchas. On 17.6.2010 the appellant got recorded a second disclosure statement while in custody,
whereby, he stated that some additional clothes which he had worn on the day of the incident could
be got recovered. Accordingly, on the basis of such statement Ext.50 dated 17.6.2010, the police
party along with the appellant proceeded and searched room No.206 in Deepshree Building at,
approximately two kilometers from Valiv Naka. One Ganesh Bheema (Ganesh Kapildev Mishra)
opened the door of the room and, as per the disclosure by the appellant, the police recovered certain
incriminating articles vide Memo (Ext.51) dated 17.6.2010.
36. All the articles recovered prior to 17.6.2010 were sent for scientific analysis vide letters Ext.68
and Ext.69 both dated 16.6.2010, the blood sample of the appellant was sent for DNA profiling. He
also sent a letter to the Civil Hospital for collection of the blood, nails, and hair samples of the
appellant. During investigation, he procured the report of the chemical analysis as also the DNA
report and the FSL report. The said DNA report prepared by an expert revealed samples of “viscera”
(semen) of the appellant on swab drawn from the private parts of the prosecutrix. He also recorded
the statement of Munna Saroj, who was residing with the appellant. So is the essence of the
examination-in-chief of this witness.
37. It may be noted that neither this witness nor anyone else has deposed the fact of medical
examination of the appellant, as is stipulated under Section 53A of the Code of Criminal Procedure
(hereafter, ‘Cr.P.C.’).
38. Further, whether his communication for medical examination of the appellant was ever followed
up at all is not known. So also, its resultant consequences. Who took the samples of the body parts of
the appellant, if at all, is a mystery. The record does not disclose such fact. Non-examination of
Ganesh Bheema and Munna Saroj in Court, despite being cited witnesses renders his version to be
uncorroborated, thereby creating a gap in chain of circumstances, preventing it from being
complete.
39. The house from where the articles were recovered on 17.6.2010 was neither owned nor in the
exclusive possession of the appellant. Instead, as is admitted by the Investigating Officer, it belonged
to a third party. The Investigating Officer admits that the said house was occupied by one Ganesh
Bheema, who was never examined in the case, so also why and what is that Munna Saroj disclosed
on 19.6.2010, has not seen the light of the day. Their complicity in the crime has also not been ruled
out. On this issue examination of Ext.35 reveals that the house where appellant was residing was
owned by Munna Lalchand and that it was jointly possessed by the appellant and Prakash who have
not been examined.
40. What further renders the veracity of the testimony of this witness to be questionable has
surfaced in the cross-examination part, wherein he admits not to have mentioned in the statement
Ext.47 “that the accused had hidden the clothes”. In this view of the matter, the articles so
discovered cannot be said to form a discovery in terms Section 27 of the Evidence Act.

41. Significantly, from the testimony of PW 7 it is evident that appellant did not know Marathi
language for he states that “I know that the appellant does not know Marathi”.
42. Close examination of the testimony of Panch witness PW 8 reveals that the appellant had given
his statement in Hindi and not in Marathi.
43. Though, PW 13 is silent on this fact, but perusal of the said disclosure statements (Ext.47 &
Ext.50) reveals the same to have been recorded in Marathi and the Investigating Officer not having
ever read over or explained contents thereof to the appellant in his vernacular language. As a result
thereof, certainty is absent as to the correctness of the statement as made and the statement, as
recorded by the police.
44. A Constitution Bench of this Court, in Syed Qasim Razvi v. State of Hyderabad3, in the following
extract observed that when 3 1953 SCR 589 there is a lack of understanding of the language of the
Court, it causes prejudice to the appellant. The bench observed:
“9. …There is no doubt that ordinary court proceedings in Hyderabad are conducted
in Urdu, but Urdu is certainly not the spoken language of even the majority of the
people within the Hyderabad State. If the accused in a particular case is not
acquainted with the English language and if by reason of the absence of adequate
arrangements to have the proceedings interpreted to him in the language he
understands, he is prejudiced in his trial, obviously it might be a ground which may
be raised on his behalf in an appeal against his conviction. But in our opinion cannot
be said that the provision in the Regulation relating to proceeding being conducted in
English if the tribunal so desires per se violates the equal protection clause in the
Constitution.” (Emphasis Supplied)
45. In the case at hand, the aforementioned proposition of law is squarely applicable. From a perusal
of material on record, we find that the Appellant did not know how to read and write in Marathi.
This being the position, this Court has highlighted the importance of the appellant being able to
understand the case of the prosecution against him. Inability to do so, by virtue of a language barrier
causes prejudice to the case of the appellant. There is nothing on record to show that it was not
practicable to record evidence of the appellant as well as others, whose vernacular was not Marathi,
but Hindi. The original testimony, from which the text, tenor and true import of their testimony may
be gauged, is not part of the record. Therefore, it is apparent that statutory safeguards in reference
to language have not been complied with, causing prejudice to the appellant in terms of Syed Qasim
Rizvi (supra). Here only taking note of the decision of this Court rendered in Siju Kurian v. State of
Karnataka 2023 SCC OnLine 429, we clarify the said decision to have been taken, given the
attending facts where the appellant was provided with the assistance of interpreter and his
disclosure statement leading to discovery of a fact, unlike the instant case not linking the recovery to
the appellant with the crime.
46. Further, PW 1 has stated that the key of the room, after effecting recovery on 16.6.2010, was
given to the “room partner of the accused”. Who is this room partner? Was he examined? Was he
Prakash Nishad @ Kewat Zinak ... vs The State Of Maharashtra on 19 May, 2023
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/21033879/
10
aware of the clothes being hidden? Did he hide the clothes? Was his complicity in the crime ruled
out? Are all questions left to be guessed. Such room partner remains unexamined and his complicity
and role in the crime not explored.
47. Version of the Investigating Officer, that it was PW 12 who locked the room, does not inspire
confidence. The witness does not remember having placed on record any document indicating that
the lock was labelled and sealed for the search being conducted at the first instance. It may be noted
that in the memos as well, he admits not to have mentioned where exactly the appellant had kept
clothes in the room.
48. On the issue of first disclosure statement Ext.47, we find the version of PW 13 to be materially
contradicted by the Panch witness PW 7, who, in no uncertain terms and unrefutedly, has deposed
that “Devraj asked me that the clothes were hidden in the appellant’s house and as to whether I was
ready to act as a panch.” (here PW 13 – the Investigating Officer is referred to as Devraj). This totally
shatters the prosecution case on the point of recovery pursuant to the alleged disclosure statement.
49. Even on the point of recovery of the nicker of the prosecutrix there is contradiction with regard
to its place and numbers. We notice that the dead body was recovered in the presence of two
independent witnesses, namely, PW 9 and PW 10. Significantly, PW 9 states that on 12.6.2010 the
dead body of the prosecutrix was recovered from the nala and that “one nicker was lying on a tin
shade. One blood smeared banian was lying on the roof”. He further adds that after recovery, the
dead body was brought home. “She was raped” (here reference is of the prosecutrix) and that “blood
had come out from the private part of the girl”. He does not state that tin shade was that of the
house of the appellant. However, PW 1 has deposed that “The knicker of my daughter was found on
the roof of the accused.” But this is in complete contradiction to the statement of PW 13 who stated
that the nicker and the banian were recovered pursuant to the disclosure statement of the appellant.
On this issue, further contradiction emerges through the testimony of PW 10 who states that “there
were no clothes on her person” but in the very next breath adds that “she had worn underwear on
her person”, and also that “he had not seen the body of the deceased girl”. Also, PW 10 states that he
cannot read or write in Marathi and that he affixed his signatures on Ext.43 at the police station
which is in Marathi. Hence, what is the truth and whom to believe is difficult to infer from the
record.
Circumstance of Scientific Examination, in particular DNA Report of the Scientific Officer
50. We may examine the case from yet another angle and that being, as to whether, even if the
recovery on the search conducted on 13.6.2010, 16.6.2010 and 17.6.2010 is believed to be so, either
on the basis of information obtained from the police during investigation or as a consequence of
statement made by the appellant or any other material obtained by the police during the course of
investigation, the same stands linked to the appellant or not.
51. We find on this count the prosecution has not sufficiently proven the case. This is for two reasons
: (1) If the alleged house of the appellant was thoroughly searched on 13.6.2010, as is evident from
memo Ext.35 and recovery memo Ext.36, then the question of recovery of articles on 16.6.2010
Prakash Nishad @ Kewat Zinak ... vs The State Of Maharashtra on 19 May, 2023

11
should not arise. The house is nothing but a small room of 8.5 feet x 6.5. feet (out of which a
bathroom was 2.5 feet x 2.5 feet), as is evident from Ext.35. The police party in the absence of
appellant had microscopically scanned the said room, and yet could not find any material allegedly
recovered on 16.6.2010 vide memo Ext.48; (2) Even the recovered articles, be it of the search
conducted on 13.6.2010, 16.6.2010 and 17.6.2010, do not sufficiently link the appellant to the crime.
For elaboration, we extract herein in a tabular form, the articles recovered, numbered, accepted and
the scientific evaluation thereof.

52. From the aforesaid chart, it is evident that no blood of the appellant was found on any one of the
articles recovered by the police. Only stains of semen were found on the nicker (brown) belonging to
the prosecutrix and her vaginal swabs.
53. To establish clinching evidence against the appellant, the prosecution seeks reliance on
communication dated 16.6.2010 whereby PW 13 sent certain articles for analysis to the Director,
Forensic Laboratory, Maharashtra. In terms of the aforesaid, the articles, be that of the appellant or
that of the prosecutrix recovered on 12th, 13th and 14th of June, 2010, are as follows :

23. Bottle 7 Nail clippings of right hand. Ex. 23
24. Bottle 8 Nail clipping of left hand. Ex. 24
54. Perusal of these documents reveals that samples of the blood and semen of the appellant were
sent for forensic analysis. Importantly though, there is nothing on record to establish as to who took
such samples, on what date, on how many occasions and why were they not sent all at once, we
notice that none of the police officials have testified to the formalities of keeping the samples safe
and secure being complied with.
55. The first alleged blood sample of the appellant collected on 14.6.2010 was sent for analysis vide
communication dated 16.6.2010 (Ext.60). The second alleged blood sample of the appellant taken
on 20.7.2010 was sent the very same day vide communication (Ext.72).
56. There is only one document (Ext.79) on record, indicating the appellant to have been medically
examined. But even this document does not reveal sample of the body part being drawn. In any
event, the doctor who conducted such examination, has not stepped into the witness box to testify
the correctness of the contents thereof. Also the document itself is uninspiring confidence as we
notice certain interpolations therein and in a different hand. Additionally, the document does not

Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/21033879/
14
fall true to the statutory requirements imposed under Section 53A Cr.P.C.
57. This Court in Krishan Kumar Malik v. State of Haryana4 (two-Judge), observed the necessity of
compliance with Section 53A, which later on was clarified in Rajendra Prahladrao 4 (2011) 7 SCC
130 Wasnik v. State of Maharashtra5 (three-Judges) that the said provision is not mandatory in
nature. It was observed that it only requires a positive call to be taken in respect of the need to
follow the provision or not. The bench held-
“49…There must be reasonable grounds for believing that the examination of a
person will afford evidence as to the commission of an offence of rape or an attempt
to commit rape. If reasonable grounds exist, then a medical examination as
postulated by Section 53-A(2) CrPC must be conducted and that includes
examination of the accused and description of material taken from the person of the
accused for DNA profiling…” (Emphasis Supplied)
58. Here, a child of the tender age of six was assaulted brutally and killed. The appellant was
arrested on suspicion of having committed the crime. The police proceeded in accordance therewith
and were supposed to have made discoveries as per the statements made by the appellant in
custody, then in what manner can it be said that, at the time when such a positive call was required
to be made by the authorities, reasonable grounds did not exist for the compliance with Section 53A
to be a must? This, in the view of this Court is a glaring lapse in the investigation of this crime, for a
six- year-old child was sexually assaulted on both of the private parts 5 (2019) 12 SCC 460 of her
body. Medical examination of the appellant would have resulted into ascertainment of such assault.
59. As has been hitherto observed, there is no clarity of who took the samples of the appellant. In
any event, record reveals that one set of samples taken on 14.6.2010 were sent for chemical analysis
on 16.6.2010 and the second sample taken, a month later on 20.7.2010 is sent the very same day.
Why there exist these differing degrees of promptitude in respect of similar, if not the same- natured
scientific evidence, is unexplained.
60. We may observe that the Maharashtra Police Manual6, when speaking of the integrity of
scientific evidence in Appendix XXIV states-
“The integrity of exhibits and control samples must be safeguarded from the moment
of seizure upto the completion of examination in the laboratory. This is best done by
immediately packing, sealing and labeling and to prove the continuity of the integrity
of the samples, the messenger or bearer will have to testify in Court that what he had
received was sealed and delivered in the same condition in the laboratory. The
laboratory must certify that they have compared the seals and found them to be
correct. Articles should always be kept apart from one another after packing them
separately and contact be scrupulously avoided in transport also.” 6 Available here-

61. In the present case, the delay in sending the samples is unexplained and therefore, the possibility
of contamination and the concomitant prospect of diminishment in value cannot be reasonably
ruled out. On the need for expedition in ensuring that samples when collected are sent to the
concerned laboratory as soon as possible, we may refer to “Guidelines for collection, storage and
transportation of Crime Scene DNA samples For Investigating Officers- Central Forensic Science
Laboratory Directorate Of Forensic Sciences Services Ministry Of Home Affairs, Govt. of India”7
which in particular reference to blood and semen, irrespective of its form, i.e. liquid or dry
(crust/stain or spatter) records the sample so taken “Must be submitted in the laboratory without
any delay.”
62. The document also lays emphasis on the ‘chain of custody’ being maintained. Chain of custody
implies that right from the time of taking of the sample, to the time its role in the investigation and
processes subsequent, is complete, each person handling said piece of evidence must duly be
acknowledged in the documentation, so as to ensure that the integrity is uncompromised. It is
r e c o m m e n d e d  t h a t  a  d o c u m e n t  b e  d u l y  7  A v a i l a b l e  a t -
http://cfslchandigarh.gov.in/Uploads/Media/Original/20180627121024_IO- SOP%20Final.pdf
maintained cataloguing the custody. A chain of custody document in other words is a document,
“which should include name or initials of the individual collecting the evidence, each person or
entity subsequently having custody of it, dated the items were collected or transferred, agency and
case number, victim’s or suspect’s name and the brief description of the item.”
63. Indisputably, these “without any delay” and “chain of custody” aspects which are indispensable
to the vitality of such evidence, were not complied with. In such a situation, this court cannot hold
the DNA Report Ext.85 to be so dependable as to send someone to the gallows on this basis. We
have carefully perused FSL as well as DNA report forming part of the record. A snapshot of the said

64. Even otherwise, on the value of DNA evidence, we may refer to an observation made by this
Court, in Pattu Rajan v. State of T.N.8, as under;
“52. Like all other opinion evidence, the probative value accorded to DNA evidence
also varies from case to case, depending on the facts and circumstances and the
weight accorded to other evidence on record, whether contrary or corroborative. This
is all the more important to remember, given that even though the accuracy of DNA
evidence may be increasing with the advancement of science and technology with
every passing day, thereby making it more and more reliable, we have not yet reached
a juncture where it may be said to be infallible. Thus, it cannot be said that the
absence of DNA evidence would lead to an adverse inference against a party,
especially in the presence of other cogent and reliable evidence on record in favour of
such party.” (Emphasis supplied)
65. Referring to the above case, a three-Judge bench in Manoj v. State of M.P.9, through S. Ravindra
Bhat J., observed;
“158. This Court, therefore, has relied on DNA reports, in the past, where the guilt of
an accused was sought to be established. Notably, the reliance was to corroborate.
This Court highlighted the need to ensure quality in the testing and eliminate the
possibility of contamination of evidence; it also held that being an opinion, the
probative value of such evidence has to vary from case to case.”
66. In the present case, even though, the DNA evidence by way of a report was present, its reliability
is not infallible, especially not so in light of the fact that the uncompromised nature of such 8 (2019)
4 SCC 771 9 (2023) 2 SCC 353 evidence cannot be established; and other that cogent evidence as can
be seen from our discussion above, is absent almost in its entirety.
67. Unfortunately, the courts below did not go into all the aforesaid aspects and presumptuously
assumed the guilt of the appellant and held him to have committed the crime.
68. What prevailed upon the courts below, it appears, was the testimony of the doctor PW 4 - Dr.
Anjali Pimple, who conducted the post-mortem and, “the clinching medical evidence” and “clinching
DNA report”. It is on the basis of the said medical evidence that the courts, without recording any
findings with regard to the circumstances being unrefuted, convicted the appellant despite there
being contradictions, material in nature, belying the prosecution case and the veracity of the
statement of witnesses, so also impeaching their credibility.

69. Further, what weighed with the courts below is more so evident from the findings returned by
the High Court, i.e., nature of the alleged crime being indeed one of the heart-breaking, horrific and
most depraved kind, prompting the confirmation of the death sentence awarded by the Trial Court,
considering the case to be the rarest of rare.
70. It is true that the unfortunate incident did take place, and the prosecutrix sustained multiple
injuries on her body and surely must have suffered great pain, agony, and trauma. At the tender age
of 6, a life for which much was in store in the future was terrifyingly destroyed and extinguished.
The parents of the prosecutrix suffered an unfathomable loss; a wound for which there is no remedy.
71. Despite such painful realities being part of this case, we cannot hold within law, the prosecution
to have undergone all necessary lengths and efforts to take the steps necessary for driving home the
guilt of the appellant and that of none else in the crime.
72. There are, in fact, yawning gaps in the chain of circumstances rendering it far from being
established- pointing to the guilt of the appellant.
73. As already pointed out, there are several irregularities and illegalities on the part of the agencies
examining the case.
74. The questions raised in the instant appeals are answered accordingly.
75. Before parting with the matter, we must take note of the manner in which the investigation into
this dastardly crime was undertaken. Numerous lapses blot the entire map. We have already pointed
out multiple instances which have led to the chain of circumstances remaining broken, the larger
picture emerging therefrom being that the person, whomsoever they may have been, remains
unpunished to this day.
76. Both the crimes committed against the innocent six-year-old child, are unquestionably, malum
in se i.e., evil and wrong on their own, without the prohibition of law making it so. This fact, coupled
with the duty upon the investigating authorities not only to protect the citizens of the country, but
also ensure fair and proper investigations into crimes affecting the society, as in the present case,
casts upon such authorities, in the considered view of this Court, not only legal, but also a moral
duty to take all possible steps within the letter of the law to bring the doers of such acts to the book.
77. In the instant case, the reasons why the investigation officers were changed time and again from
PW 6 to PW 12 and then to PW 13, is surprising and unexplained. As we have already pointed out,
no reason stands given for having decided that there was no need to comply with the provisions of
Section 53A, Cr.P.C.; there is unexplained delay in sending the samples collected for analysis; a
premises already searched was searched again, the reason for which is not borne from record; lock
panchnama is not prepared; no samples of blood and semen of the appellant can be said to have
been drawn by any medical or para medical staff; allegedly an additional sample is taken from the
appellant more than a month after the arrest; alleged disclosure statement of the appellant was
never read over and explained to the appellant in his vernacular language; the appellant was not

residing alone at the place alleged to be his residence; and what was the basis of appellant being a
suspect at the first instance, remains a mystery; persons who may have shed light on essential
aspects- Ganesh Bheema and Munna Saroj went unexamined etc., such multitudinous lapses have
compromised the quest to punish the doer of such a barbaric act in absolute peril.
78. The charges mentioned above, although serious and grievous in nature, cannot be said to have
been met against the present appellant. The factum of the commission of the crime against the
six-year-old innocent child is not in dispute and cannot be deprecated enough even in the most
severe terms. However, as the above discussion has laid out clearly, the circumstances forming the
chain of commission of this crime cannot and do not point conclusively to the appellant in a manner
that he may be punished for the same much less, with the sentence of being put to death.
79. In view of the above the charges levied on the appellant stand not proved.
80. This court, recently, in Maghavendra Pratap Singh @Pankaj Singh v. State of Chattisgarh10 had
emphasised the role and responsibilities of the investigating authorities by referring to various
judgments of this Court. Such principles, which are essential to successful investigations, were not
adhered to. Needless to state, such responsibilities would be all the more heightened in cases of
crimes involving severe punishments such as imprisonment for life or the sentence of death.
Considering the nature of the case, the police ought to have, even more than usual, taken steps,
precautions, and decisions to safeguard the fact- finding and investigation exercise.
81. In view of the above, the appeals are allowed. Ex-consequenti, the judgment dated 27.11.2014 in
Sessions Case No.407/2010, passed by District Judge-2 and Additional Sessions Judge, Thane as
affirmed by the High Court vide judgment dated 13th & 14th October, 2015 in Confirmation Case
No.4/2014 titled as State of 10 2023 SCC OnLine SC 486 Maharashtra v. Prakash Nishad @ Kewat
Zinak Nishad and Criminal Appeal No.88/2015 titled as Prakash Nishad @ Kewat Zinak Nishad Vs.
State of Maharashtra, respectively, convicting the appellant under Sections 302, 376, 377 and 201
IPC and sentencing him to death and life imprisonment and other punishments described above, are
quashed and set aside.
82. The appellant be set at liberty forthwith, if not required in any other case. Pending applications,
if any, are also disposed of.
