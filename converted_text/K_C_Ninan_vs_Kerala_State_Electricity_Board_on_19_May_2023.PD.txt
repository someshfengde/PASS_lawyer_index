A.         Overview
1.         The nineteen cases in this batch of appeals follow a similar pattern of

facts. The supply of electricity was discontinued due to the failure of the previous
owners to pay the dues for consumption of electricity on the premises. The
previous owners had borrowed money or raised loans on the security of their
premises. In some cases, the erstwhile owner went into liquidation. The premises
were sold in auction sales generally on an “as is where is” basis. The new
owners, who purchased the properties in auction, applied for new electricity
connections for the premises to which electricity had been disconnected for
failure to pay the dues. The Electric Utilities refused to provide an electricity
connection unless the auction purchaser paid the dues of the previous owner.
This refusal was derived from powers conferred under subordinate legislations,
notifications, electricity Supply Codes or state regulations. The denial of electricity
supply resulted in the institution of petitions under Article 226 before the High
Court, leading to the judgments which are in appeal.
2.         In Maharashtra State Electricity Board v. Super & Stainless Hi Alloy
Ltd1, this Court by an order dated 24 August 2006 referred the Civil Appeals to a
Bench of three Judges for dealing with the issue of the recovery of arrears of
electricity. The order of reference referred the question of whether electricity dues
constitute a charge on the property so far as the transferor and the transferee of
the unit are concerned.

above reference by an order dated 1 November 2007. The issue which is raised

in these appeals is whether the arrears of unpaid electricity dues outstanding
from the erstwhile owner can be claimed from the subsequent owner, who has
acquired the property in proceedings initiated to enforce mortgages or to pay off
the dues of creditors.
B.         Regulatory Regime
4.         Electricity is a concurrent subject under the Constitution of India. Prior to
the enactment of the Electricity Act 20032, the Electricity Act 19103 governed the
supply and use of electrical energy in India. The 1910 Act prescribed the legal
framework for laying down cables and other works related to the supply of
electricity. It also laid down a legal framework for supply of electrical energy and
imposed certain responsibilities and obligations on persons licensed to supply
electricity with a view to incentivise the growth of the electricity industry through
private licensees.
5.         Section 2(c) of the 1910 Act defined “consumer” as any person supplied
with energy by a licensee or any other person engaged in the business of
supplying energy to the public under the Act, and included any person whose
premises were for the time being connected for the purposes of receiving energy.
Section 21(2) empowered a licensee to make conditions to regulate their
relations with persons who were or intend to become consumers. Section 22

obligated a licensee to supply electrical energy, on application, to every person

within the area of supply on the same terms as those on which any other person
in the same area was entitled. Section 24 empowered the licensee to disconnect
the supply of electricity if any person neglected to pay any charge or sum for
energy due to the licensee.
6.         The 1910 Act was found inadequate for a coordinated development of
electricity and a “grid-system” in India. Therefore, the Electricity (Supply) Act
19484 was enacted for the rationalisation of the production and supply of
electricity and for taking measures conducive to the development of electricity.
The 1948 Act mandated the state governments to constitute State Electricity
Boards under Section 5 and entrusted them with the responsibility of
administering the grid-system and arranging the supply of electricity in the state.
Section 26 provided that, subject to the provisions of the Act, the Board shall
have all the powers and the obligations of a licensee under the 1910 Act. Section
49 empowered the Boards to supply electricity to any person, not being a
licensee, on such terms and conditions as laid down by the Board. In terms of
Section 70(2), the provisions of the 1948 Act were in addition to, and not in
derogation of the 1910 Act.
7.         Parliament enacted the Electricity Regulatory Commissions Act 19985 with
an aim to distance the government from determination of tariffs. The 1998 Act
created the Central Electricity Regulatory Commission and enabled the state
governments to create State Electricity Regulatory Commissions.

8.          Parliament consolidated and harmonised the provisions of the 1910 Act,
1948 Act, and 1998 Act by enacting the 2003 Act. In the process, the 2003 Act
repealed the aforesaid three legislations. The long title of the 2003 Act reads as
follows:
                  “An Act to consolidate the laws relating to generation,
                  transmission, distribution, trading and use of
                  electricity and generally for taking measures
                  conducive to development of electricity industry,
                  promoting competition therein, protecting interests of
                  consumers and supply of electricity to all areas,
                  rationalisation of electricity tariff, ensuring transparent
                  policies regarding subsidies, promotion of efficient
                  and environmentally benign policies, constitution of
                  Central Electricity Authority, Regulatory Commissions
                  and establishment of Appellate Tribunal and for
                  matters connected therewith or incidental thereto.”
9.          The 2003 Act has been enacted in pursuance of the policy of encouraging
private sector participation in the generation, transmission, and distribution of
electricity. Other objectives of the 2003 Act include vesting the regulatory
responsibilities from government to the regulatory commissions, delicensing of
electricity generation, promotion of captive generation, and encouraging open
access transmission. Section 2(15) of the 2003 Act defines ‘consumer’ in terms
similar to Section 2(c) of the 1910 Act. Part VI of the 2003 Act deals with
distribution of electricity. Section 43 casts a Universal Service Obligation6 on the
distribution licensee to provide supply of electricity to the premises of an owner or
occupier. The State Commission has been empowered under Section 50 to
specify an Electricity Supply Code to provide among other things for the recovery
of electricity charges, intervals for billing of electricity charges and disconnection

of supply of electricity for non-payment. Under Section 56, the generating
company or distribution licensee, as the case may be, may disconnect electricity
supply of any person who neglects to pay any charge or sum for electricity.
Section 181(2)(x) provides that the State Commission may make regulations inter
alia providing for, the Electricity Supply Code under Section 50.
10.      In light of the provisions contained in the 1910 Act, 1948 Act, and 2003
Act, various Electric Utilities such as State Electricity Regulatory Commissions,
State Electricity Boards, and distribution licensees notified Conditions of Supply
requiring the new owner of premises to clear the outstanding dues of the previous
owner. The nineteen cases in the batch of appeals originate from the States of
Kerala, Maharashtra, Gujarat, Assam, and West Bengal.
11.     In Kerala, the Kerala State Electricity Board7 notified the Conditions of
Supply of Electrical Energy in 1990. Condition 15(e) of the Conditions of Supply
provides that reconnection or a new connection shall not be given to any
premises unless the arrears due to the Board are cleared.
12.     In Maharashtra, the Maharashtra State Electricity Board8 framed MSEB
Conditions and Miscellaneous Charges for Supply of Electrical Energy, 19769 in
exercise of power under the 1948 Act. Clause 23(b) of the MSEB Conditions of
Supply allowed the Board to refuse to supply or give a new electricity connection
to any person claiming to be an heir, legal representative, transferee, assignee or
successor of the defaulting consumer. After the enactment of the 2003 Act, the

Maharashtra Electricity Regulatory Commission (Electricity Supply Code and
other Conditions of Supply) Regulations 200510 were framed. Regulation 10.5
provides that unpaid electricity dues constitute a charge on the property and can
be recovered from the transferee (subject to a maximum of six months of unpaid
charges for electricity supplied).
13.     In Gujarat, the Gujarat Electricity Board inserted Condition 2(j) in the
Conditions and Miscellaneous Charges for Supply of Electrical Energy in 2001.11
This condition empowered the Board to insist that the new occupier of the
premises clear the pending electricity dues of the previous consumer as a
precondition to reconnection or release of a fresh connection. In 2005, the
Gujarat Electricity Regulatory Board notified the Gujarat Electricity Regulatory
Commission (Electricity Supply Code and Related Matters) Regulations, 200512.
Clause 4.1.11 of Gujarat Electricity Supply Code, 2005 provided that only the
dues of the applicant, if any, were required to be paid at the time of the
application for a new connection. The said Clause was later amended in 2010 to
provide that the distribution licensee need not entertain an application for
reconnection or a new connection unless any dues relating to those premises are
cleared.

Assam Electricity Regulatory Commission (Electricity Supply Code and Related
Matters) Regulations, 2004.14 Clause 3.6 dealing with the requisition of electricity
supply requires a person occupying a new premises to ensure that all the
outstanding electricity dues are duly paid up and discharged.
15.     In West Bengal, the West Bengal Electricity Regulatory Commission
(Electricity Supply Code) Regulations, 201215 have been notified under the 2003
Act. Clause 3.4.2 of the said regulations empowers the licensee to recover the
dues of a previous consumer in respect of the premises from a new consumer
only if there is a nexus between the previous consumer and the new consumer.
16.     The subsequent owners or occupiers of the premises challenged the
Conditions of Supply and Electricity Supply Codes enacted by the Electric Utilities
before the respective High Courts when they were called upon to clear the
arrears of the previous owners or dues relating to the premises.
C.      The position in law
17.      Prior to the enactment of the 2003 Act, in Isha Marbles v. Bihar State
Electricity Board,16 a three-judge Bench of this Court held that in the absence of
a charge being created over the premises by a statutory regulation, an auction
purchaser cannot be asked to clear the past arrears of electricity dues as a
condition precedent to the grant of electricity. This Court elucidated the position in
the context of Section 24 of the 1910 Act to emphasise that the contract for

�                                                                            PART C
supply was only between the Electricity Board and the previous consumer, and
the subsequent purchaser was neither a consumer within the meaning of the
1910 Act nor had any contractual relationship with the Electricity Board. This
Court noted that though electricity is public property which the law must protect,
yet the law, as it stood at that time, was inadequate to enforce the liability of
unpaid electricity charges of a previous consumer against a subsequent
purchaser of the premises. In Isha Marbles (supra), this Court did not have to
deal with any statutory rule, regulation or conditions of supply dealing with the
imposition of liability for the payment of electricity dues on a subsequent
purchaser.
18.        Thereafter, another Bench of three judges in Ahmedabad Electricity Co.
Ltd. v. Gujarat Inns (P) Ltd,17 held that in a case of a fresh connection, though
the premises are the same, the auction purchasers cannot be held liable to clear
the arrears incurred by the previous owners in respect of power supplied to the
premises in the absence of a specific statutory provision in that regard. However,
this Court opined that there was a need for reconsideration of the “wide
propositions of law” laid down in Isha Marbles (supra).
19.        In Hyderabad Vanaspathi Ltd v. Andhra Pradesh State Electricity
Board,18 a three-judge Bench of this Court observed that the terms and
conditions of supply notified by the Electricity Boards are statutory in character as
they have been framed in exercise of statutory power under Section 49 of the

consumer did not make the agreement contractual in nature.
20.       In a series of subsequent decisions of this Court, various two-judge Bench
decisions have taken note of specific statutory regulations enabling recovery of
dues from subsequent purchasers. In the process, this Court distinguished Isha
Marbles (supra), where the Court had no occasion to consider similar provisions.
In Dakshin Haryana Bijli Vitran Nigam Ltd v. M/s Paramount Polymers Pvt
Ltd,19 this Court was dealing with Clause 21A of the relevant Conditions of
Supply, which entitled a licensee to demand payment of outstanding dues from a
transferee if they desired a service connection. It was held that Isha Marbles
(supra) cannot be applied to strike down Clause 21A as the Court in that case
had no occasion to consider the effect of a similar clause. The matter was
remitted back to the High Court for a fresh decision since it had not adjudicated
on the implication of Clause 21A of the Conditions of Supply.
21.       In Paschimanchal Vidyut Vitran Nigam Limited v. DVS Steels and
Alloys Private Limited,20 this Court observed that a licensee or an electricity
distributor can insist upon fulfilment of statutory rules, regulations or the
conditions of supply so long as they are not arbitrary and unreasonable. It was
further held that the conditions of supply mandating the clearance of electricity
dues of a previous owner by a new purchaser before electricity supply is restored
or a new connection is given to the premises cannot be termed as unreasonable
or arbitrary.

                        “16.1. That electricity dues, where they are
                        statutory in character under the Electricity Act and
                        as per the terms & conditions of supply, cannot be
                        waived in view of the provisions of the Act itself
                        more specifically Section 56 of the Electricity Act,
                        2003 (in pari materia with Section 24 of the
                        Electricity Act, 1910), and cannot partake the
                        character of dues of purely contractual nature
                        16.2. Where, as in cases of the E-auction notice in
                        question, the existence of electricity dues, whether
                        quantified or not, has been specifically mentioned
                        as a liability of the purchaser and the sale is on “AS
                        IS WHERE IS, WHATEVER THERE IS AND
                        WITHOUT RECOURSE BASIS”, there can be no
                        doubt that the liability to pay electricity dues exists
                        on the respondent (purchaser)
                        16.3. The debate over connection or reconnection
                        would not exist in cases like the present one where
                        both aspects are covered as per clause 8.4 of the
                        General Terms & Conditions of Supply.”
Having set the stage of the legal and decisional framework, we have been tasked
to decide the present batch of appeals.

�                                                                           PART D
D.    Issues
23.   Based on the submissions of the parties, the specific issues which arise for
determination are:
         a. Whether the Universal Service Obligation under Section 43 of the
            2003 Act is linked to premises to which the connection is sought;
         b. Whether a connection of electricity supply sought by an auction-
            purchaser comprises a reconnection or a fresh connection;
         c. Whether the power to recover arrears of a previous owner or
            occupier from an auction-purchaser of the premises falls within the
            regulatory regime of the 2003 Act;
         d. Whether the power to enable the recovery of arrears of the previous
            owner or occupier from an auction-purchaser can be provided
            through subordinate legislation by the State Commissions;
         e. Whether the 1910 Act, 1948 Act, and the 2003 Act have express
            provisions enabling the creation of a charge or encumbrance over
            the premises;
         f. Whether the statutory bar on recovery of electricity dues after the
            limitation of two years provided under Section 56(2) of the 2003 Act,
            will have an implication on civil remedies of the Electric Utilities to
            recover such arrears; and

              g. What is the implication of an auction-sale of premises on “as is

E.         Submissions
24.        To put the above-mentioned issues in their proper context, we refer to the
broad legal submission adduced before us by the parties.
      I.            Electric Utilities
25.        Sarvashri M G Ramachandran, Mr Ranjit Kumar, Mr Vijay Hansaria, Mr.
Ajit Bhasme, learned senior counsel appearing for Electric Utilities have made the
following submissions:
      a.             USO is not absolute
              i.       (i)   The duty of the licensee to supply electricity under Sectio
                             of the 2003 Act is not absolute. Section 43 provides that a
                             applicant has to fulfil the corresponding obligations to be
                             entitled to the supply of electricity;
              ii.      (ii) Section 43(1) opens with the words “save as otherwise
                             provided in the Act”, which brings in compliance with other
                             provisions of the 2003 Act including Section 50 which
                             empowers the State Commission to specify the Electricity

                             Supply Code;
                                                   15
�                                                                          PART E
    iii.   (iii) The Explanation to Section 43(1) requires the applicant to
               submit an application complete in all respects along with
               documents showing payment of necessary charges and other
               compliances. This payment not only includes application fees,
               but also includes the charges related to supply of electricity;
               The other compliances would include due discharge of any
               pending or outstanding dues, if so demanded by the licensee;
               and
    iv.    (iv) Section   43(2)   specifically   provides   that   the   applicant
               has to fulfil the obligation to pay the price as determined by
               the State Commission to demand the supply of electricity.
               The term “price” used in Section 43 is the consideration for
               the supply of electricity.
b. Supply of electricity is with respect to premises
     i.    The supply of electricity is with reference to the “premises”
           according to Sections 2(15), 43, 45, and 50 of the 2003 Act.
           Similar provisions existed in the 1910 Act and 1948 Act. Further,
           the disconnection dealt in Section 56 of the 2003 Act and Section
           24 of the 1910 Act necessarily relate to identified premises;
    ii.    The definition of consumer under Section 2(15) of the 2003 Act
           includes “any person whose premises are for the time being
           connected for the purpose of receiving electricity with the works of

           a licensee…” Hence the expression “premises” is the continued

�                                                                          PART E
            identified place for supply of electricity, irrespective of any change
            in the owner or occupier; and
    iii.    The Electric Utilities are required to have an infrastructure in place
            for the purposes of supplying electricity to consumers. They have
            to incur operation and maintenance costs to be in readiness to
            supply electricity. Therefore, if liability is not fastened to the
            premises, such charges would ultimately be borne by the general
            consumers since this would be factored in the fixation of tariff.
c. Regulatory regime to recover arrears of electricity dues
   i.      Section 49 of the 1948 Act empowers the Electricity Board to supply
           electricity upon such terms and conditions as the Board thinks fit.
           Under Section 79 of the 1948 Act, the Board can make regulations
           not inconsistent with the Act and the Rules made thereunder. In
           Hyderabad Vanaspathi (supra) this Court held that terms and
           conditions of supply framed by the Electricity Board under Section
           49 of the 1948 Act are statutory in character;
  ii.      The terms and conditions of supply under the 2003 Act are framed
           by independent regulators in terms of Section 50 read with Section
           181(2)(x) of the 2003 Act after following a detailed procedure.
           Therefore, the Electricity Supply Code framed by the State
           Commission is a subordinate legislation and has a statutory
           character. This statutory authority enables the Supply Code to

                   provide for recovery of dues of the previous owner from the
                   subsequent owner; and
       iii.        The condition of payment of outstanding dues is not a compulsory
                   extraction of money and does not require a primary legislation by
                   Parliament or state legislature. Such a condition can be prescribed
                   by a subordinate legislation.
 d. Electricity arrears as charge over the premises
              i.    i.   It is not the case of the Electric Utilities that there is any
                         mortgage or charge over the property in the form that the
                         licensee is a secured creditor. The licensee has the right to
                         insist on clearance of outstanding dues of the premises
                         before giving a new connection.
 e. Civil and Statutory remedies to recover electricity arrears of the
        Utilities
(i)           Section 56(2) of the 2003 Act does not bar the recovery of electricity
              arrears through other avenues of recovery in accordance with law;
(ii)          The limitation of two years under Section 56(2) of the 2003 Act is with
              reference to bar on disconnection by the licensee. There is no
              limitation under Section 56 after the electricity is discontinued for non-
              payment of dues. A Condition of Supply to recover electricity arrears is
              not barred by limitation under Section 56(2) of the 2003 Act; and

      (iii)       The right of a distribution licensee to deny electricity connection ti
                  outstanding dues are cleared is a continuing right and cannot be said
                  to be extinguished. It can be exercised when the new owner or
                  occupier approaches the licensee for connection.
       f. Implication of an auction-sale of premises on “as is where is” basis
             I.   i.       The auction purchasers were put to notice of the requirement
                           of clearing the dues as the public auction-sale of the premis
                           on “as is where is” basis would include a condition of
                           acknowledging all liabilities in respect of the said premises
                           with or without specific reference to the payment of electric
                           dues;
             i.   ii.      There is an obligation on persons acquiring the premises to
                           verify and obtain a no dues certificate from the licensee or
                           otherwise factor the dues while quoting the bid price in the
                           auction; and
          ii.     iii.     The purchaser cannot deny knowledge of the requirement to
                           clear outstanding dues of the premises when these are
                           provided for in the conditions of supply or Supply Code.

Jitendra Malkan, and Mr. MY Deshmukh learned counsel on behalf of the auction
purchasers have urged the following submissions:
         a. USO is absolute
   i.      (i)    Electricity constitutes goods within the meaning of Entries 53,   54,
                  and 56 of List II of the Seventh Schedule of the Constitution and
                  under the Sale of Goods Act 1930;
   ii.     (ii)   The obligation to provide electricity to consumers under    Section
                  43 of the 2003 Act is not hedged by a condition to    discharge   the
                  arrears incurred by the previous consumer;
  iii.     (iii) The     phrase     “price   as   determined    by     the   appropriate
                  commission” in Section 43(2) of the 2003 Act could only be        the
                  price at which electricity is supplied to the distribution licensee.
                  Thus, ‘price’ under Section 43 cannot include the     arrears of the
                  previous consumer;
           (iv) The payment of necessary “charges” and “other compliances”
                  contemplated under Section 43 relates to the application fees, and
                  cannot be stretched to include a power to require the payment of
                  third-party arrears;
             (v) The statutory duty of a licensee to supply power on an application
                  by the owner or occupier of any premises within one month is
                  contained in Section 43(1) of the 2003 Act. The only exception to

20
                  this statutory obligation is provided by Section 44 where the licensee
                                             20
�                                                                          PART E
          is prevented from giving supply due to cyclone, floods, storms or
          other circumstances beyond his control; and
        (vi) The legislature has consciously inserted all the substantive
          requirements which the person making an application for supply of
          electricity is required to meet, which has been primarily captured
          under Sections 43(2), 45, 46, 47, and 48 of the 2003 Act.
          Therefore, no power has been endowed upon the State
          Commission to impose any other substantive condition in the form
          of providing a precondition of clearance of a previous owners’ dues
          on a subsequent owner who seeks a fresh connection. Any such
          condition would be in conflict with Section 43.
b. Supply of electricity is with respect to consumer
 (i)      The reference to “premises” in the definition of “consumer” under
Section 2(15) as well as under Section 43 of the 2003 Act is only to
          fix a situs, that is, to identify a licensee operating in the area vis-à-
          vis the property. The emphasis under Section 2(15) is therefore on
          the “person” who is the owner or occupier of the premises; and
 (ii)     Sections 2(15), 43, and 44 refer to “premises” because while an
          ordinary manufacturer or distributor may insist on the consumer to
          come to this factory or warehouse to take the supply of goods, the
          distribution licensee is obliged to take the supply to the consumer’s
          premises. Therefore, the premises where the supply is to be made

          had to be necessarily identified.

�                                                                          PART E
c. Regulatory regime to recover arrears of electricity dues
     a. The provisions of the 1910 Act and 1948 Act do not empower the
        Electricity Board to recover the electricity dues of the previous
        owner or occupier from the new owner or occupier of such
        premises. The liability to pay electricity dues is only on the person to
        whom the supply of electricity is made. It is a contractual liability;
     b. Section 49 of the 1948 Act only enables the Board to prescribe the
        conditions of supply in a contract to be entered into with the
        prospective consumer. Such conditions of supply cannot be termed
        as rules or regulations as they are not published in the official
        gazette and therefore, cannot have the character of regulations and
        are not statutory in character; and
i.   c. A condition requiring an applicant to clear the past dues of a
        previous consumer before the application for a fresh connection is
        considered is manifestly unfair. The arrears are due to a default
        committed by a previous consumer and the negligence of the
        Electric Utilities which continued to supply electricity despite default,
        without resorting to its power of disconnection.
d. Subordinate Legislation
      a. The liability of one person, whether statutory or contractual, cannot
         be enforced against another person unless there is a substantive
         provision in law to do so. Such enforcement of liability cannot be
         provided by a piece of delegated legislation;

      b. Even if it is assumed that such liability can be enforced by a
         delegated legislation, the parent law must clearly prescribe the
         power of framing such a piece of legislation. Neither the 1910 Act
         nor the 1948 Act provides any specific provision empowering the
         Electricity Board to recover the electricity dues of the previous
         owner or occupier of the premises from the new owner or occupier
         of premises in question;
      c. The scheme of the 2003 Act, from Sections 43 to 49, makes it
         evident that no specific power has been conferred upon the State

         Act 1882. The Conditions of Supply are contained in a contract
         and to constitute a charge, it must be registered under Section 17
         of the Indian Registration Act 1908; and

     a. Under Section 56 of the 2003 Act, the right to disconnect the
         supply in default of payment is relatable to the default committed
         by the defaulting consumer. Electric Utilities cannot recover dues
         over and above what is provided for in the Section 56 (2) of the
         2003 Act; and
     b. To the extent that the monies realised from sale of the company in
         liquidation were insufficient to clear the unsecured debts such as

                      dues to mount up instead of taking effective steps to recover the
                      dues. Conditions of Supply cannot be used to resurrect a time-

       (i)       A condition such as “as is where is and whatever there is” is a feature
                 of physical properties and does not extend to claims that are not

                 cases where there is no statutory imposition of liability for past dues
                 previous owners on subsequent purchasers.
F.            Analysis
  I.          Universal Service Obligation is not absolute
27.           The Electric Utilities have argued that the duty to supply electricity und
Section 43 of the 2003 Act is not absolute. It has been submitted that under
Section 43, an applicant has to fulfil the obligation to pay the ‘price’ as
determined by the State Commission to become entitled to receive supply of
electricity. The ‘price’, it is urged, includes application fees as well as arrears of
unpaid electricity dues of the previous owner or occupier. The Electric Utilities
argue that in case there are outstanding dues of the previous owner they are

entitled to refuse a new connection or decline to commence the supply of
electricity until the dues owed by the previous owner are cleared. On the
contrary, the auction purchasers have urged that Section 43 obligates the
distribution licensees to supply electricity when demanded by the auction
purchaser. It is further urged that the ‘price’ in Section 43 can only mean the price
at which electricity is supplied to the distribution licensee, and cannot include the
arrears of the previous owner or occupier of the premises.
28.   To contextualise the submissions of counsel, it is appropriate to refer to the
relevant provisions of the 1910 and 2003 enactments. Under Section 3 of the
1910 Act, the State Government could grant a licence to any person to supply
energy in any specified area. By virtue of Section 3(2)(f), the provisions contained
in the Schedule stood incorporated in the licence. Under Section 22 read with
Section 3(2)(f) and Clause VI of the first Schedule, there was an obligation to
supply electricity on the distribution licensees. Section 22 of the 1910 Act
obligated the licensee to supply energy to every person within the area of supply
on the same terms as those on which any other person in the same area was
entitled. Clause VI provided that the licensee shall supply energy within one
month of a requisition by the owner or occupier of any premises situated within
the area of supply.
29.    Section 43 of the 2003 Act is similar to Section 22 of 1910 Act read with
Clause VI of Schedule I of the latter Act. Part VI of the 2003 Act contains
provisions dealing with distribution of electricity by distribution licensees. Section
2(17) defines a ‘distribution licensee’ as a licensee authorised to operate and
maintain a distribution system for supplying electricity to the consumer in their

area of supply. Section 43 of the 2003 Act casts a duty on every distribution
licensee to supply electricity to the premises on an application made by the
owner or occupier of such premises. The provision requires the distribution
licensee to lay down its network in a particular area to supply electricity to a
consumer, who demands supply.
30.   The relevant portion of Section 43 reads as follows:
               “43. Duty to supply on request – (1) Save as
               otherwise provided in this Act, every distribution
               licensee, shall, on an application by the owner
               or occupier of any premises, give supply of
               electricity to such premises, within one month
               after receipt of the application requiring such
               supply:
               ***
Explanation – For the purposes of this sub-
section, “application” means application complete in all respects in the appropriate form, as
required by the distribution licensee, along with the documents showing payment of necessary
charges and other compliances.
(2) It shall be the duty of every distribution licensee to provide, if required, electric plant or electric
line for giving electric supply to the premises specified in sub-section (1):
Provided that no person shall be entitled to demand, or to continue to receive, from a licensee a
supply of electricity for any premises having a separate supply unless he has agreed with the licensee
to pay to him such price as determined by the Appropriate Commission.” (emphasis supplied)
31. According to Section 43, the distribution licensee is obligated to supply electricity to the
premises of an owner or occupier within a month of the receipt of an application requiring such
supply. The provision casts a duty on the distribution licensee to supply electricity to the owner or
occupier’s premises. PART F Correspondingly, the owner or occupier of the premises has a right to
apply for and obtain electric supply from the distribution licensee.22 Both the right and the
corresponding duty are imposed by the statute. The owner or occupier of the premises has to submit
an application to avail of the supply of electricity.
32. In Brihanmumbai Electric Supply & Transport Undertaking v. Maharashtra Electricity
Regulatory Commission,23 a two-judge Bench of this Court observed that the obligation of the
distribution licensee to supply electricity to premises will begin after the owner or occupier of such
K.C. Ninan vs Kerala State Electricity Board & ... on 19 May, 2023

27
premises submits a completed application. The explanation to Section 43 clarifies that the
application must be complete in all respects along with the necessary documents showing payment
of “necessary charges” and other compliances, as required by the distribution licensee. Thus, under
Section 43, the distribution licensee is obligated to supply electricity to the premises of an owner or
occupier, provided that the owner or occupier pays all charges and complies with all conditions
stipulated by the distribution licensee. Section 43 begins with the words “Save as otherwise provided
in this Act”. Hence, the operation of Section 43 will also be subject to compliance with the other
provisions of the 2003 Act.
33. Section 45 lays down the manner of computation of the price to be charged by the distribution
licensee for supply of electricity under Section 43. It provides that a distribution licensee may fix
charges for supply of electricity in accordance with the tariffs fixed from time to time in accordance
with the methods and principles specified by the concerned State Commission. Under Section 46, a
distribution licensee is empowered to charge from any person who seeks Chandu Khamaru v. Nayan
Malik, (2011) 12 SCC 314 (2015) 2 SCC 438 PART F supply of electricity any expenses reasonably
incurred in providing any electric line or electric plant used for the purpose of giving electricity.
Section 47 empowers the distribution licensee to seek a reasonable security from any person who
requires supply under Section 43. It further provides that the distribution licensee can refuse to
supply electricity to any person who fails to give the security deposit. The provision is extracted
below:
“47. Power to require security – (1) Subject to the provisions of this section, a
distribution licensee may require any person, who requires a supply of electricity in
pursuance of section 43, to give him reasonable security, as may be determined by
regulations, for the payment to him of all monies which may become due to him –
(a) in respect of the electricity supplied to such person; or
(b) where any electricity line or electrical plant or electric meter is to be provided for
supplying electricity to such person, in respect of the provision of such line or plant
or meter, And if that person fails to give such security, the distribution licensee may,
if he thinks fit, refuse to give the supply of electricity or to provide the line or plant or
meter for the period during which the failure continues.” (emphasis supplied)
34. Section 47 indicates that a distribution licensee can refuse to supply electricity under Section 43
if the applicant fails to furnish the requisite security. Under Section 48, a distribution licensee may
require the applicant, who requires a supply of electricity in pursuance of Section 43, to accept (i)
any restrictions which may be imposed for the purpose of enabling the distribution licensee to
comply with the regulations made under Section 53; and (ii) any terms restricting any liability of the
distribution licensee for economic loss resulting from PART F negligence of the person to whom
electricity is supplied. Thus, it is implicit that the distribution licensee may refuse electricity supply
to the applicant until they accept such terms and restrictions reasonably imposed by the distribution
licensee incidental to the statute.

35. Further, Section 50 empowers the State Commission to specify an Electricity Supply Code
providing for recovery of electricity charges, among other things. The Electric Utilities have urged
that the duty to supply electricity is subject to the Electricity Supply Code specified under Section
50. As mentioned in the preceding paragraphs, an applicant is required to submit a completed
application along with documents showing the payment of necessary charges and other
compliances. The Electricity Supply Code can stipulate such other compliances that an applicant has
to observe for getting the supply of electricity under Section 43. Therefore, reading Section 43 along
with Sections 45, 46, 47, 48, and 50, it becomes evident that the right of an applicant to seek supply
of electricity under Section 43 is not absolute. The right is subject to the payment of charges,
security deposit, as well as terms and restrictions imposed by the distribution licensee.
36. The distribution licensee can stipulate such terms and conditions as it deems necessary when an
owner or occupier of the premises approaches it seeking the supply of electricity. A two-judge Bench
of this Court in Paschimanchal Vidyut Vitran Nigam (supra) held that a distribution licensee can
stipulate terms and conditions subject to which it will supply electricity to the applicant which are
not arbitrary and unreasonable. PART F
37. The auction purchasers have urged that the “charges” levied by the distribution licensee are
explicitly dealt with by Section 45. It was further urged that Section 45 does not provide that charges
should include the arrears of the previous owner or occupier of the premises. On the contrary, the
distribution licensees have argued that the term ‘price’ used in Section 43 is the consideration for
the supply of electricity as determined by the State Commission. It has been argued that the arrears
of the previous owner or occupier of the premises is also a ‘price’ determined by the State
Commission and payable at the time of making an application for the supply of electricity.
38. The words “price”, “tariff”, or “charges” have not been defined in the 1910 Act or the 2003 Act.
In AP TRANSCO v. Sai Renewable Power (P) Ltd,24 this Court observed that the term “tariff” has
neither been defined nor explained in the 2003 Act. The Court held that in the absence of any
specific definition in the legislation, recourse has to be taken to the “meaning attached to these
expressions under the general law or in common parlance.”25
39. In BSES Ltd. v. Tata Power Co. Ltd.,26 a two-judge Bench of this Court interpreted ‘tariff’ in the
context of the Electricity Regulatory Commissions Act, 1998. It observed:
“16. The word “tariff” has not been defined in the Act. “Tariff” is a cartel of commerce
and normally it is a book of rates. It will mean a schedule of standard prices or
charges provided to the category or categories of customers specified in the tariff.”
(2011) 11 SCC 34 (2011) 11 SCC 34 (2004) 1 SCC 195 PART F
40. The proviso to Section 43(2) further refers to the “price” payable by an applicant to demand or
to continue to receive the supply of electricity from a distribution licensee. The “price” is to be
determined by the appropriate commission. This “price” is the consideration, as determined by the
State Commission, that an applicant pays for receiving a supply of electricity.
K.C. Ninan vs Kerala State Electricity Board & ... on 19 May, 2023
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/160269658/
29
41. The term “price” has to be given a broad meaning to include all the ‘tariffs’ and ‘charges’ that
may be determined by the appropriate commission. This includes the ‘charges’ fixed under Section
45 by the appropriate commission from time to time and the ‘charges’ that a distribution licensee
may impose under Section 46 to recover any reasonable expenditure. The ambit of the term ‘price’ is
wide enough to also include the statutory dues that the State Commission decides to enact by way of
regulations under Section 50.
42. Thus, the duty to supply electricity under Section 43 is not absolute, and is subject to the such
charges and compliances stipulated by the distribution licensees as part of the application.
II. Duty to supply electricity is with respect to consumer
43. The Electric Utilities urge that the duty to supply electricity is with respect to the premises and
not to an individual. They refer to the definition of ‘consumer’ under Section 2(15) and to Section 43
of the 2003 Act. Further, it was urged that Section 50 and Section 181(2)(x) of the 2003 Act enable
the distribution licensee to provide for payment of dues of electricity supplied to the premises if a
reconnection or new connection is sought for the same premises. Contrariwise, the auction
purchasers have submitted that the consumption of electricity is PART F always by the owner or
occupier of the premises through appliances and apparatus installed within the premises. The
reference to premises in the definition of ‘consumer’ under Section 2(15) as well as Section 43 of the
2003 Act is, it is urged, only to fix a situs for the supply of electricity to the owner or occupier of the
premises.
44. Electricity is a movable good because it can be transmitted, transferred, delivered, and possessed
like any other movable property.27 This position of law was established by a Constitution Bench of
this Court in State of AP v. National Thermal Power Corporation Ltd.28 In Paschimanchal Vidyut
Vitaran Nigam (supra) a two-judge bench of this Court held that the supply of electricity to a
consumer is a sale of goods. The charges paid by the consumer to the distribution licensee is
essentially the price paid for goods supplied and consumed. The consumption of electricity by a
consumer is always effected through equipment or appliances installed within the premises.
45. Section 2(15) of the 2003 Act defines the expression ‘consumer’ as follows:
“(15) “consumer” means any person who is supplied with electricity for his own use
by a licensee or the Government or by any other person engaged in the business of
supplying electricity to the public under this Act or any other law for the time being
in force and includes any person whose premises are for the time being connected for
the purpose of receiving electricity with the works of a licensee, the Government or
such other person, as the case may be;” (emphasis supplied) Commissioner of Sales
Tax, Madhya Pradesh, Indore v. Madhya Pradesh Electricity Board, Jabalpur (1969) 1
SCC 200 (2002) 5 SCC 203, paragraph 20.

46. The definition of “consumer” under Section 2(15) of the 2003 Act is similar to the definition of
“consumer” in the 1910 Act. The definition consists of two limbs:
(i) any person who is supplied with electricity for their own use; and
(ii) any person whose premises are for the time being connected for the purposes of
receiving electricity, irrespective of whether or not such person is supplied with
electricity for his own use.29 The first limb of the definition is prefaced with “means”
while the second limb is prefaced with “includes”. The definition is thus exhaustive of
the ambit of the expression defined. The inclusive part is intended to expand the
ambit of the initial limb of the definition.
47. In Jivendra Nath Kaul v. Collector/District Magistrate30, a two judge Bench of this Court held
that the meaning of the phrase “for the time being” means at the moment or the existing position.
The reference to premises in the second limb connotes that the demand for guaranteed charges or
dues will incur even if the owner or occupier has stopped consuming power for the time being, but
the premises remain connected. The second limb clarifies that a consumer who commences
receiving power at the premises will continue to remain a consumer even if they stop consuming
power for the time being, so long as the premises are connected to the power system. The second
limb encompasses a variety of foreseeable and practical situations. For example, the consumer may
have rented out the premises to a tenant. In this situation, the consumer Uttar Pradesh Power
Corporation Limited v. Anis Ahmad, (2013) 8 SCC 491 (1992) 3 SCC 576 PART F continues to
remain a consumer as the premises are connected for the time being for the purposes of receiving
the supply of electricity, though the consumer may not themselves be consuming electricity (the
consumption being by the tenant). Here, the distribution licensee demands charges incurred from
the consumer, even though the electricity is being consumed by the tenant. Another situation
contemplated under the second limb is where the consumer is unable to consume electricity due to
circumstances such as accident or strike. In this case, as long as the premises of the consumer are
connected to the power system, they will have to pay the demand charges and minimum guaranteed
charges stipulated by the distribution licensee.
48. We are unable to accept the submission of Electric Utilities that the second limb of Section 2(15)
connotes a supply of electricity to premises, irrespective of a change in the owner or occupier. The
2003 Act provides an inclusive definition of ‘premises’ under Section 2(51). According to the
definition, premises include land, building, or structure. The second limb goes only so far as to say
that when electricity is supplied to any person at a particular land, building, or structure, such
person will continue to remain a consumer, even though they are not consuming electricity, so long
as the electricity connection exists. The expression ‘premises’ used in the second limb identifies the
place where the supply of electricity has to be made.
49. It would be material to refer to some other definitions under the 2003 Act which emphasise that
supply of electricity is with respect to consumer:

“2. Definitions.- In this Act, unless the context otherwise requires,- *** PART F (17) “distribution
licensee” means a licensee authorised to operate and maintain a distribution system for supplying
electricity to the consumers in his area of supply;
*** (19) “distribution system” means the system of wires and associated facilities between the
delivery points on the transmission lines or generating station connection and the point of
connection to the installation of the consumers; *** (61) “service line” means any electric supply line
through which electricity is, or is intended to be, supplied -
(a) to a single consumer either from a distributing main or immediately from the Distribution
Licensee’s premises; or
(b) from a distributing main to a group of consumers on the same premises or on contiguous
premises supplied from the same point of the distribution main;
*** (70) “supply”, in relation to electricity, means the sale of electricity to a licensee or consumer;”
(emphasis supplied)
50. The definition of ‘supply’ specifically states that supply means the sale of electricity to a
consumer. The said definition does not indicate that supply of electricity is vis-a-vis the premises of
the consumer. Considering the overall scheme of the 2003 Act, the supply of electricity is to the
consumer and not the premises.
51. Section 43 of the 2003 Act obligates a distribution licensee to supply electricity “on an
application by the owner or occupier of any premises”. Under the provision, the right to obtain a
supply of electricity is vested with the owner or occupier of the premises. Invariably, such owner or
occupier means the consumer under Section 2(15). As held in Brihanmumbai Electric Supply &
Transport Undertaking (supra), the duty to supply electricity comes into play only on an application
made by the owner or occupier of the premises. Hence, PART F the term “premises” has to be
contextualised and understood with respect to the preceding portion, that is, the owner or occupier
of the premises.
52. The duty to supply electricity under Section 43 is only with respect to the owner or occupier of
the premises, and not the premises, as it is the owner or occupier who has the statutory right to
“demand” electricity for the premises under their use or occupation. Further, it is the applicant who
has to fulfil all the statutory conditions laid down under the 2003 Act to become entitled to get
supply of electricity to their premises. The applicant has to pay the necessary charges and comply
with all terms and conditions as determined by the appropriate commission for the supply of
electricity.
53. It is true that Sections 43 and 44 of the 2003 Act talk about supply of electricity to premises.
However, the use of such phrases is borne out of the practical consideration of supply of electricity.
Unlike other goods, a distribution licensee cannot insist that the consumer come to their factory or
warehouse to receive the supply of electricity. The distribution licensee necessarily has to lay down
K.C. Ninan vs Kerala State Electricity Board & ... on 19 May, 2023
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/160269658/
32
special infrastructure such as electricity lines and transformers to transmit electricity and supply it
directly to the consumer, at their premises. On an application, the distribution licensee is statutorily
obliged to supply electricity to the consumer. Consequently, the place where the supply of electricity
is to be made has to be necessarily identified. Thus, Section 43 and 44 refer to the consumer’s
premises to fix the situs for the purpose of supplying electricity.
54. Section 56 provides that it is the liability of the consumer to pay the charge for electricity in
respect of the supply of electricity. Under Section 56 the duty of effecting the payment of charges for
electricity is on a person, that is, the PART F consumer. Further, Section 56(2) specifically contains
the expression “no sum due from any consumer”. Section 126 also uses the words “the electricity
charges payable by such person or any other person benefited by such use.” Thus, the overall
scheme of the 2003 Act makes it evident that only a consumer can be held liable for default in
payment of electricity dues or charges.
55. Under the 2003 Act, the Central government has enacted various rules and regulations for
carrying out the provisions of the Act. The government notified the Electricity (Rights of
Consumers) Rules, 202031 laying down the rights of the consumers of electricity. The Rules detail
the rights of consumers and obligations of distribution licensees; release of new connections;
metering arrangements; billing and payment; disconnection and reconnection; grievance redressal
mechanism, among others. The Rules define an ‘applicant’ as an owner or occupier of any premises
who files an application form with a distribution licensee for supply of electricity. The Rules defines
‘point of supply’ to mean the point, as may be specified by the State Commission, at which a
consumer is supplied electricity. The Rules make it evident that electricity is supplied to the
consumer.
56. Thus, it is always the consumer who is supplied electricity and is held liable for defaulting on
payment of dues or charges for supply of electricity. Perforce, the premises cannot be held to be a
defaulter and no dues can be attached to the premises of the consumer.
“Rules” PART F III. Whether electricity connection sought by a subsequent owner constitutes a
reconnection or fresh connection
57. Another issue before us, as argued by the counsel, is whether the connection sought by a
subsequent owner constitutes a reconnection or fresh connection. In Isha Marbles (supra), the
Electricity Board had disconnected electricity supplied to the erstwhile owner pursuant to its power
under Section 24 of the 1910 Act. The Electricity Board insisted upon the auction purchaser paying
the arrears owed by the erstwhile owner as a condition precedent to provide an electricity
connection. The Board did not place reliance on any statutory conditions of supply. This Court
observed that the law, as it stood then, was inadequate to enforce such a liability. The Court further
held that a connection sought by a subsequent purchaser should be regarded as a reconnection:
“49. It is important to note that though the purchasers asked for electricity
connection as a new connection it cannot be regarded as a new connection. It is only
a reconnection since the premises had already been supplied with electrical energy.

Such a supply had been disconnected owing to the default of the consumer. That
consumer had bound himself to the Board to pay the dues. He also agreed to abide by
the condition as stipulated in the Act and the Rules including the payment of the
dues.” (emphasis supplied)
58. This Court further went on to hold that a distribution licensee cannot make the
auction-purchaser liable when seeking reconnection of electricity supply for the same premises.
According to the Court, this was not feasible considering the fact that “with change of every
ownership new connections have to be issued [which] does not appear to be the correct line of
approach as such situation is PART F brought by the inaction of the Electricity Board in not
recovering the arrears as and when they fall due or not providing itself by adequate deposits.”
However, this Court also conceded that liability of previous owners could be fastened on
auction-purchasers if the law so prescribed.
59. In Gujarat Inns (supra), another three-judge Bench of this Court held that the connection sought
by auction-purchasers of properties would constitute a fresh connection. The Court held that in case
of a fresh connection, the auction purchasers cannot be held liable to clear the arrears incurred by
the previous owners in the absence of any specific statutory provision. It was observed:
“3. In our opinion, the present two cases are cases of fresh connection. The learned
counsel for the respondents (auction-purchasers) have stated that they have taken
fresh connections and they have no objection if their connections are treated as fresh
connections given on the dates on which the supply of electricity was restored to the
premises. We are clearly of the opinion that in case of a fresh connection though the
premises are the same, the auction-purchasers cannot be held liable to clear the
arrears incurred by the previous owners in respect of power supply to the premises in
the absence of there being a specific statutory provision in that regard. Though we
find some merit in the submission of the learned counsel for the appellant calling for
reconsideration of the wide propositions of law laid down in Isha Marbles case
[(1995) 2 SCC 648] we think the present one is not a case for such exercise. We leave
the plea open for consideration in an appropriate case.” (emphasis supplied)
60. In Isha Marbles (supra), a three-judge Bench of this Court held that an application for supply of
electricity to the same premises is to be regarded as a reconnection. This Court, while interpreting
the provisions of the 1910 Act, gave its reasoning on the assumption that the supply of electricity is
with respect to PART F premises and not the consumer. However, the 2003 Act has statutorily
clarified the position that supply of electricity is with respect to the consumer. It necessarily follows
that when a new owner or occupier of the premises applies for supply of electricity in terms of
Section 43 of the 2003 Act, it will constitute a fresh connection, regardless of the fact that the
premises for which the electricity is sought was being supplied with electricity previously. An
application for supply of electricity can be categorised as reconnection only when the same owner or
occupier of the premises, who was already a consumer, applies for supply of electricity with respect
to the same premises in case the electricity supply is disconnected.

61. We need to highlight that the 2003 Act contemplates a synergy between the consumer and
premises. Under Section 43 of the 2003 Act, the owner or occupier of premises can seek a supply of
electricity for particular premises. Perforce, when electricity is supplied, the owner or occupier
becomes a consumer only with respect to those particular premises for which electricity is sought
and provided. For example, when a person owning an apartment in a residential complex applies for
supply of electricity to such an apartment, they become a consumer only with respect to the
apartment for which the application is made and to which electricity is supplied. Such a person may
own another apartment to which electricity may already be supplied, but they will be considered a
separate consumer with respect to the second apartment. For an application to be considered as a
‘reconnection’, the applicant has to seek supply of electricity with respect to the same premises for
which electricity was already PART F provided. Even if the consumer is the same, but the premises
are different, it will be considered as a fresh connection and not a reconnection.
62. In Gujarat Inns. (supra), this Court held that an application for electricity by an
auction-purchaser will constitute fresh connection even though the premises are the same. The
reasoning is based on the correct assumption that supply of electricity is with respect to the
consumer, and not the premises. Therefore, even if the premises may be the same to which
electricity had already been supplied, it will be considered as a fresh connection in the situation
where a different applicant, in that case an auction-purchaser, applies for supply of electricity.
IV. Regulatory power of the Electricity Boards/ State Commissions
63. The Electric Utilities have submitted that: (i) Section 49 of the 1948 Act empowered the Board to
supply electricity upon such terms and conditions as it thinks fit; (ii) the phrase “regulate” in Section
79 of the 1948 Act has a wider implication allowing the State Commission to do everything
necessary to prescribe the principles governing the supply of electricity; (iii) the Electricity Supply
Code notified under Section 50 read with Section 181(2)(x) of the 2003 Act governs all matters
relating to the supply of electricity to premises; and (iv) the Conditions of Supply which provide for
payment of outstanding dues of the previous consumer have a clear nexus to the scheme of the 2003
Act and the objectives sought to be achieved.
64. From the other side, the auction purchasers have urged that: (i) the provisions of the 1910 Act,
1948 Act, and the 2003 Act do not empower the PART F Electricity Board or, as the case may be the
distribution licencee to recover the arrears of electricity of the previous consumer from the new
owner or occupier of the premises; and (ii) the conditions of supply prescribed under the 1948 Act
do not have the character of regulations and are not statutory.
65. Section 2(h) of the 1910 Act defined “licensee” as any person licensed under Part II to supply
energy. Section 21 provided that a distribution licensee shall not interfere with the use of energy by
any person. Section 21(2) empowered the licensee to make conditions for the purpose of regulating
its relations with the consumer with the previous sanction of the State Government.
66. The 1910 Act did not include the State Electricity Board within the definition of “licensee”.
Section 26 of the 1948 Act states that the Board shall, in respect of the whole State, have all the
K.C. Ninan vs Kerala State Electricity Board & ... on 19 May, 2023
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/160269658/
35
powers and obligations of a licensee under the 1910 Act. The first proviso specified that certain
provisions of the 1910 Act relating to the duties and obligations of a licensee shall not be applicable
to the Board. In its decision in State of Uttar Pradesh v. Hindustan Aluminium Corporation32 this
Court analysed the interconnection between Section 26 of the 1948 Act and Section 22 of the 1910
Act. The court held that the obligation under Section 22 of the 1910 Act to supply energy to every
person within the area of supply is not fastened to the Board. Although Clause VI of Schedule to the
1910 Act also mandates the licensee to supply electricity on demand, the second proviso specifies
that the said clause is applicable to the Board only when the distribution mains have been laid by the
Board and the supply through any of them has commenced.
(1979) 3 SCC 229 PART F
67. Under Section 21 of the 1910 Act, the Supply Licensee prescribed conditions with the previous
sanction of the state government. Similarly, the Boards could also prescribe conditions under
Section 21 of the 1910 Act by virtue of Section 26 of the 1948 Act.
68. Section 49 of the 1948 Act read as follows:
“49. Provisions for the sale of electricity by the Board to persons other than
licensees.- (1) Subject to the provisions of this Act and of regulations, if any made in
this behalf, the Board may supply electricity to any person not being a licensee upon
such terms and conditions as the Board thinks fit and may for the purposes of such
supply frame uniform tariffs.” *** (emphasis supplied) Under the 1948 Act, the
Electricity Boards were empowered to prescribe terms and conditions of supply
under Section 49 read with Section 79(j). The Board was empowered to fix such
terms and conditions as it thinks fit for supply of electricity to any person not being a
licensee. Section 79 permitted the Board to make regulations providing for the
principles governing the supply of electricity by the Board to persons other than
licensees under Section 49:
“79. Power to make regulations.- The Board may by notification in the Official
Gazette, make regulations not inconsistent with this Act and the rules made
thereunder to provide for all or any of the following matters, namely:-
***
(j) principles governing the supply of electricity by the Board to persons other than
licensees under section 49;” PART F Clause (j) of Section 79 empowered the Board to
make regulations prescribing the principles governing the supply of electricity to
consumers. According to Section 79A, any regulation made by the Board had to be
laid before the State Legislature. Thus, the conditions of supply framed by the Board
under section 49 read with section 79 and section 79A possessed a statutory nature
and would be binding on consumers.

69. It has been a consistent position in law that the conditions of supply stipulated by the licensees
or Boards have a statutory character.33 A two-judge Bench of this Court, in Jagdamba Paper
Industries (P) Ltd v. Haryana State Electricity Board,34 was dealing with a challenge to the
unilateral enhancement of security by the Board under the agreement with consumers of electric
energy. This Court held that the Board has been conferred with statutory powers under section 49(1)
of the 1948 Act to determine the conditions on the basis of which supply is to be made. Similarly, in
Bihar State Electricity Board v. Parmeshwar Kumar Agarwala35, a two-judge Bench of this Court
held that the terms and conditions on which the Board supplies electricity to a consumer have a
statutory character.
70. In Ferro Alloys Corpn. Ltd v. A P State Electricity Board36 a two-judge Bench of this Court
upheld the validity of Section 49 of the 1948 Act. The Court observed that the terms and conditions
notified under Section 49 must relate to the object and purpose for which they were issued. There,
the Court upheld the authority of the Board to prescribe a security deposit in the following terms:
Punjab State Electricity Board v. Bassi Cold Storage, Kharar and Another, 1994 Supp (2) SCC 124
(1983) 4 SCC 508 (1996) 4 SCC 686 1993 Supp (4) SCC 136 PART F “102. [...] Under the regulations
framed by the Board in exercise of powers of Section 49 read with Section 79(j) the consumer is only
entitled and the Board has an obligation to supply energy to the consumer upon such terms and
conditions as laid down in the regulations. If, therefore, the regulations prescribed a security deposit
that will have to be complied with. It also requires to be noticed under Clause VI of the Schedule to
the Electricity Act that the requisition for supply of energy by the Board is to be made under proviso
(a) after a written contract is duly executed with sufficient security. This, together with the
regulations stated above, could be enough to clothe it with legal sanction.”
71. In Hyderabad Vanaspathi (supra), a three-judge Bench of this Court had to decide upon the
validity of Condition 39 of the “Terms and Conditions of Supply” prescribing an adjudicatory
machinery for assessing and levying penal damages. This Court considered the legal provisions
under the 1910 Act and 1948 Act to hold that terms and conditions notified under Section 49 of the
latter enactment were valid and had statutory force. The relevant paragraph is extracted below:
“20. We have already seen that Section 49 of the Supply Act empowers the Board to
prescribe such terms and conditions as it thinks fit for supplying electricity to any
person other than a licensee. The Section empowers the Board also to frame uniform
tariffs for such supply. Under Section 79(j) the Board could have made regulation
therefor but admittedly no regulation has so far been made by the Board. The Terms
and Conditions of Supply were notified in BPMs No. 690 dated 17-9-1975 in exercise
of the powers conferred by Section 49 of the Supply Act. They came into effect from
20-10-1975. They were made applicable to all consumers availing supply of electricity
from the Board. The Section in the Act does not require the Board to enter into a
contract with individual consumer. Even in the absence of an individual contract, the
Terms and Conditions of Supply notified by the Board will be applicable to the
consumer and he will be bound by them.
K.C. Ninan vs Kerala State Electricity Board & ... on 19 May, 2023

37
Probably in order to avoid any possible plea by PART F the consumer that he had no knowledge of
the Terms and Conditions of Supply, agreements in writing are entered into with each consumer.
That will not make the terms purely contractual. The Board in performance of a statutory duty
supplied energy on certain specific terms and conditions framed in exercise of a statutory power.
Undoubtedly the terms and conditions are statutory in character and they cannot be said to be
purely contractual.” (emphasis supplied)
72. The above discussion shows that Conditions of Supply were notified: first, by the Supply
Licensee and Electricity Boards under Section 21 of 1910 Act; and second, by the Electricity Boards
under Section 49 of 1948 Act. The decision in Hyderabad Vanaspathi Ltd (supra) is illustrative of
the fact that the courts have upheld the validity of the Conditions of Supply notified by the
Electricity Boards. Significantly, the decision in Hyderabad Vanaspati Ltd. (supra) holds that the
power of the Board to formulate terms and conditions under Section 49 of the 1948 Act is distinct
from the power to make regulations embodied under section 79 of the said Act. Therefore, the terms
and conditions of supply notified by the Board under Section 49, although in the nature of
subordinate legislation, were not required to be placed before the State Legislature under section
79A of the 1948 Act. In that case, it was also held that statutory conditions could be invalidated only
if they were in conflict with any provisions of the 1948 Act or the Constitution.
73. The auction-purchasers have referred to India Thermal Power Ltd v. State of MP37 to argue that
the conditions of supply are not statutory, but form a part of the contract between the Electricity
Board and the consumer. Hence, it (2000) 3 SCC 379 PART F was submitted that these contractual
terms cannot be enforced by the Board against the new owner or occupier of the premises. In India
Thermal Power Ltd (supra), the issue before the two-judge Bench was whether the State
Government can alter the terms of the Power Purchase Agreement entered into under Sections 43
and 43-A of the 1948 Act. Section 43 empowered the Board to enter into an arrangement with any
person for purchase or sale of electricity. Section 43-A provided that the tariff for the sale of
electricity by a generating company shall be determined in accordance with the norms regarding the
operation and plant-load factor as determined by the Central Government from time to time. It was
in light of these provisions, that this Court observed that every provision of an agreement entered
into between a generating company and Electricity Board in exercise of the enabling power
conferred under Sections 43 and 43-A does not render the entirety of the contract statutory. The
relevant observations are extracted below:
“11. [...] Merely because a contract is entered into in exercise of an enabling power
conferred by a statute that by itself cannot render the contract a statutory contract. If
entering into a contract containing the prescribed terms and conditions is a must
under the statute then that contract becomes a statutory contract. If a contract
incorporates certain terms and conditions in it which are statutory then the said
contract to that extent is statutory. A contract may contain certain other terms and
conditions which may not be of a statutory character and which have been
incorporated therein as a result of mutual agreement between the parties. Therefore,
the PPAs can be regarded as statutory only to the extent that they contain provisions
K.C. Ninan vs Kerala State Electricity Board & ... on 19 May, 2023
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/160269658/
38
regarding determination of tariff and other statutory requirements of Section
43-A(2). Opening and maintaining of an escrow account or an escrow agreement are
not the statutory requirements and, therefore, merely because PPAs contemplate
PART F maintaining escrow accounts that obligation cannot be regarded as
statutory.” (emphasis supplied)
74. We are of the opinion that the reasoning of this Court in India Thermal Power Ltd (supra)
actually supports the arguments of the Electric Utilities. As evinced from Hyderabad Vanaspathi
(supra), the conditions of supply enacted by the Boards have a statutory character. Therefore, any
condition enacted under Section 49 of the 1948 Act, specifically one requiring the new owner to
clear the arrears of the previous owner as a precondition to availing electricity supply, will have a
statutory character. When such a condition is incorporated as part of a contract, such contract also
attains a statutory character and the liability contained therein becomes a statutory liability, which
can be enforced by the utilities against third parties, including the new owners of the premises in
question.
75. The next question that comes up for consideration is whether the Electric utilities can enact a
condition providing for recoupment of electricity arrears of a previous owner from the new owner.
Under the 1948 Act, the Board could enact terms and conditions for the supply of electricity under
Section 49 read with Section 79(j). This Court has held on many occasions that the term ‘regulate’ is
to be given a wide interpretation allowing the performance of everything necessary for the organised
implementation, development, and conduct of business. In Deepak Theatre v. State of Punjab38 a
three-judge Bench of the Supreme Court held that the power to regulate implies the power to
prescribe and enforce all such proper and reasonable rules necessary for conduct of business. It was
held:
1992 Supp (1) SCC 684 PART F “3. It is settled law that the rules validly made under the Act, for all
intents and purposes, be deemed to be part of the statute. The conditions of the licence issued under
the rules form an integral part of the statute. The question emerges whether the word regulation
would encompass the power to fix rates of admission and classification of the seats. The power to
regulate may include the power to license or to refuse the licence or to require taking out a licence
and may also include the power to tax or exempt from taxation, but not the power to impose a tax
for the revenue in rule making power unless there is a valid legislation in that behalf. Therefore, the
power to regulate a particular business or calling implies the power to prescribe and enforce all such
proper and reasonable rules and regulations as may be deemed necessary to conduct the business in
a proper and orderly manner. It also includes the authority to prescribe the reasonable rules,
regulations or conditions subject to which the business may be permitted or conducted. A conjoint
reading of Section 5, Section 9, Rule 4 and condition 4-A gives, therefore, the power to the licensing
authority to classify seats and prescribe rates of admission into the cinema theatre.” (emphasis
supplied)
76. In K Ramanathan v. State of Tamil Nadu39 a three-judge Bench of this Court held that the word
“regulation” does not have a rigid or inflexible meaning. This Court observed that “power to regulate
carries with it full power over the thing subject to regulation and in absence of restrictive words, the
K.C. Ninan vs Kerala State Electricity Board & ... on 19 May, 2023
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/160269658/
39
power must be regarded as plenary over the entire subject.” The Constitution Bench in V S Rice and
Oil Mills v. State of Andhra Pradesh40 also observed that the word “regulate” is of wide import.
77. The above analysis must guide the interpretation of Section 49 read with Section 79(j) of the
1948 Act which empowered the Board to enact such terms (1985) 2 SCC 116 (1964) 7 SCR 456 PART
F and conditions as the Board thinks fit. This power of the Board would extend to enacting
conditions providing for recovery of dues of the erstwhile owner from the new owner as a
precondition for supply of electricity. Further, this Court has consistently upheld the Conditions of
Supply providing for recoupment of arrears of a previous owner from the new owner as a
pre-condition for supply of electricity. A two-judge bench of this Court in Haryana State Electricity
Board v. Hanuman Rice Mills, Dhanauri41, while summarising the position of law laid down in
Paramount Polymers (supra) and Paschimanchal Vidyut Vitran Nigam Ltd. (supra), observed that
the supplier can recover the arrears of electricity dues of the previous owner or occupier from the
purchaser of the property if the statutory rules or terms and conditions of supply which are statutory
in character authorise the same:
“12. The position therefore may be summarised thus:
(i) Electricity arrears do not constitute a charge over the property. Therefore in
general law, a transferee of a premises cannot be made liable for the dues of the
previous owner/occupier.
(ii) Where the statutory rules or terms and conditions of supply which are statutory
in character, authorise the supplier of electricity to demand from the purchaser of a
property claiming reconnection or fresh connection of electricity, the arrears due by
the previous owner/occupier in regard to supply of electricity to such premises, the
supplier can recover the arrears from a purchaser.” (emphasis supplied)
78. In Paramount Polymers (supra), a two-judge Bench of this Court was called upon to decide the
validity of clause 21-A of Terms and Conditions of (2010) 9 SCC 145 PART F Supply which provided
that no fresh connection in respect of the premises would be given to a purchaser unless the
purchaser cleared the amount that was left in arrears by the previous consumer. The Court held that
it was within the power of the Electricity Board to insert clause 21-A in the Terms and Conditions of
Supply under section 49 of the Supply Act:
“15. […] Under Section 49 of the Supply Act, the licensee or rather, the Electricity
Board, is entitled to set down the Terms and Conditions of Supply of electrical
energy. In the light of the power available to it, also in the context of Section 79(j) of
the Supply Act, it could not be said that the insertion of clause 21- A in the Terms and
Conditions of Supply of electrical energy is beyond the power of the appellant.”
(emphasis supplied)
79. As regards the 2003 Act, the Electric Utilities submit that Section 50 read with Section 181(2)(x)
authorises the State Commission to frame the conditions governing Electricity Supply enabling
K.C. Ninan vs Kerala State Electricity Board & ... on 19 May, 2023
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/160269658/
40
recovery of electrical charges, including the electricity arrears of the previous owner from the new
owner. The auction purchasers concede that Section 50 of the 2003 Act is exhaustive, but contend
that it does not enable the State Commission to lay down conditions for recovery of electricity
arrears of the previous owner. To comprehensively analyse the above submission, it is necessary to
refer to the relevant provisions under the 2003 Act.
80. Section 2(24) of the 2003 Act defines “Electricity Supply Code” to mean the Electricity Supply
Code specified under Section 50. Section 50 reads as follows:
PART F “50. The Electricity Supply Code – The State Commission shall specify an Electricity Supply
Code to provide for recovery of electricity charges, intervals for billing of electricity charges,
disconnection of supply of electricity for non-
payment thereof, restoration of supply of electricity, measures for preventing tampering, distress or
damage to electric plant or electrical line or meter, entry of distribution licensee or any person
acting or his behalf for disconnecting supply and removing the meter, entry for replacing, altering or
maintaining electric lines or electrical plants or meter and such other matters.” (emphasis supplied)
81. Section 50 of the 2003 Act specifies that the State Commission shall specify an Electricity Supply
Code. Section 2(64) defines “State Commission” as the State Electricity Regulatory Commission
constituted under Section 82(1). The State Commission is authorised to notify the Electric Supply
Code under section 181(2)(x). The use of expressions such as “recovery of electricity charges”,
“disconnection of supply”, “restoration of supply”, under Section 50 indicate that the scope of the
regulatory powers of the State Commission under the said provision is wide enough to govern all
matters relating to the supply of electricity to the premises.
82. The 2003 Act lays down the legislative framework for generation, transmission, distribution,
trading, and use of electricity in India. In the process, the Parliament has also conferred discretion
on the regulatory authorities, particularly the Central Commission and State Commission, to work
out further details within the framework of the legislative policy laid down in the legislation. While
making subordinate legislation, the delegated authority has to act within the confines of the plenary
legislation.42 The rules or regulations enacted by the JK Industries Ltd. v. Union of India, (2007) 13
SCC 673 PART F Central Commission or State Commission cannot override the 2003 Act by
stipulating inconsistent provisions or by supplanting the parent statute.
83. The 2003 Act empowers the State Commission to make regulations on matters specified under
Section 181(2). In PTC India Ltd. v. Central Electricity Regulatory Commission43 a Constitution
Bench of this Court held that regulations can be framed by State Commissions so long as they satisfy
two conditions: first, they must be consistent with the provisions of Act; and second, they must be
made for carrying out the provisions of the Act. The Court held:
“28. The 2003 Act contemplates three kinds of delegated legislation. Firstly, under
Section 176, the Central Government is empowered to make rules to carry out the
provisions of the Act. Correspondingly, the State Governments are also given powers
K.C. Ninan vs Kerala State Electricity Board & ... on 19 May, 2023
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/160269658/
41
under Section 180 to make rules. Secondly, under Section 177, the Central Authority
is also empowered to make regulations consistent with the Act and the rules to carry
out the provisions of the Act. Thirdly, under Section 178, the Central Commission can
make regulations consistent with the Act and the rules to carry out the provisions of
the Act. SERCs have a corresponding power under Section 181. The rules and
regulations have to be placed before Parliament and the State Legislatures, as the
case may be, under Sections 179 and 182. Parliament has the power to modify the
rules/regulations. This power is not conferred upon the State Legislatures. A holistic
reading of the 2003 Act leads to the conclusion that regulations can be made as long
as two conditions are satisfied, namely, that they are consistent with the Act and that
they are made for carrying out the provisions of the Act.” (emphasis supplied)
84. The scheme of the 2003 Act makes it evident that the regulatory powers of the State
Commission under section 181(2) are of wide import. The Commission (2010) 4 SCC 603 PART F
has certain plenary powers to regulate on matters contained in section 181(2), including Electric
Supply Code under Section 50. Accordingly, the Commission can notify a Supply Code governing all
the matters pertaining to supply of electricity such as “recovery of charges”, “disconnection of
supply” and “restoration of supply”. In our opinion, such an authority also extends to stipulating
conditions for recovery of electricity arrears of previous owners from new or subsequent owners.
85. In Paschimanchal Vidyut Vitran Nigam (supra), a two-judge Bench was considering the legality
of the actions of the appellant licensee to recover electricity dues from the purchaser of subdivided
plots. Clause 4.3 of the Uttar Pradesh Electricity Supply Code stipulated that a new connection to
subdivided premises shall be given only after the share of the outstanding dues attributed to such
premises is duly paid by the applicant. This Court held that a distribution licensee can stipulate such
terms necessary for supply of electricity, including that the arrears due in regard to the supply of
electricity made to the premises when they were in the occupation of the previous owner or
occupant, should be cleared before the electricity supply is restored or a fresh connection is provided
to the premises. Therefore, a condition enabling the distribution licensee to insist on the clearance
of the arrears of electricity dues of the previous consumer before resuming electricity supply to the
premises is valid and permissible under the scheme of the 2003 Act.
86. The next question that arises for consideration is whether a regulation providing for recouping
the arrears of a previous consumer from the subsequent owner has a reasonable nexus with the
provisions of the 2003 Act. Section 42 of PART F the 2003 Act requires the distribution licensee to
develop and maintain an efficient, coordinated, and economical distribution system in their area of
supply to supply electricity in accordance with the provisions of the said Act. A distribution licensee
is an intermediary, performing the function of conveying supply of electricity from generating
companies to the consumer, at their premises. In order to provide a supply of electricity to
consumers, a distribution licensee is required to lay down infrastructure such as electricity lines,
transformers, and other equipment. The nature of the supply of electricity also depends upon the
type of consumer as well their needs. The licensee has to make a significant capital outlay for
creating the necessary infrastructure as well as operation and maintenance costs to keep the
infrastructure in readiness according to Section 42. The licensees are required to maintain the
K.C. Ninan vs Kerala State Electricity Board & ... on 19 May, 2023
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/160269658/
42
infrastructure even if the consumer does not consume electricity. They are also required to pay the
salaries of their employees and pay the dues of electricity generation and transmission companies.
87. The 2003 Act has been enacted to promote the development of the electricity industry as well as
to protect the interests of the consumers and to ensure the supply of electricity to all areas. The
Supply Conditions providing for recoupment of electricity dues of a previous consumer from a new
owner are necessary to recover the costs incurred for laying down the infrastructure as well as the
ongoing current liabilities towards the electricity generation and transmission companies. In the
absence of such conditions, it may be difficult for the distribution licensees to recover defaulted
payments, adding to the revenue PART F deficits. This may adversely impact the financial health of
the distribution licensees to the detriment of the interests of the consumers.
88. In Paschimanchal Vidyut Vitran Nigam (supra), this Court observed that a condition stipulating
that the distribution licensee can recover the electricity dues from the new owner or occupier was
necessary to safeguard the interests of the distributor. It was observed:
“13. A stipulation by the distributor that the dues in regard to the electricity supplied
to the premises should be cleared before electricity supply is restored or a new
connection is given to a premises, cannot be termed as unreasonable or arbitrary. In
the absence of such a stipulation, an unscrupulous consumer may commit defaults
with impunity, and when the electricity supply is disconnected for non-payment, may
sell away the property and move on to another property, thereby making it difficult, if
not impossible for the distributor to recover the dues. Having regard to the very large
number of consumers of electricity and the frequent moving or translocating of
industrial, commercial and residential establishments, provisions similar to Clauses
4.3(g) and (h) of the Electricity Supply Code are necessary to safeguard the interests
of the distributor.” (emphasis supplied)
89. Electricity constitutes a public good. The Court’s interpretation of the law must foster this
position. In Hyderabad Vanaspati (supra) this Court was adjudicating upon the validity of Clause 39
of the Conditions of Supply which defined various malpractices and provided for enquiries by
designated officials. This Court observed that it was the statutory duty of the Board to supply,
transmit, and distribute electricity throughout the state in the most efficient and economical
manner. It was further observed that terms and conditions such as Clause 39 were necessary to
prevent unauthorised use, pilferage or malpractices PART F by the consumers. Such terms were
necessary to recoup the loss suffered by pilferages, and to stop the continuation of similar
malpractices.
90. Apart from protecting a public good, such conditions also have a reasonable nexus with objects
of the 2003 Act, such as a robust development of the electricity industry, protecting the interests of
consumers as well as the financial interests of the distribution licensees. The need to protect the
financial interests of distribution licensees has been explicitly recognized in Section 61 of the 2003
Act which empowers the Appropriate Commission to specify the terms and conditions for the
determination of tariff in accordance with commercial principles. The relevant part of the Section 61
K.C. Ninan vs Kerala State Electricity Board & ... on 19 May, 2023

reads as follows:
“61. Tariff regulations.- The Appropriate Commission shall, subject to the provisions of this Act,
specify the terms and conditions for the determination of tariff, and in doing do, shall be guided by
the following, namely:-
***
(b) the generation, transmission, distribution, and supply of electricity are conducted on commercial
principles;
***
(d) safeguarding of consumers’ interests and at the same time, recovery of the cost of electricity in a
reasonable manner;” (emphasis supplied)
91. The Conditions of Supply and Electricity Supply Code which require the payment of electricity
dues of a previous owner as a condition for the grant of an electricity connection have a clear nexus
to the scheme of the parent legislations and the objectives sought to be achieved. It is just and
reasonable for distribution licensees to specify conditions of supply requiring the subsequent owner
or PART F occupier of premises to pay the arrears of electricity dues of the previous owner or
occupier as a pre-condition for the grant of an electricity connection to protect their commercial
interests, as well as the welfare of consumers of electricity. V. Whether arrears of electricity can
become a charge or encumbrance over the premises
92. The next issue that arises for our consideration is whether arrears of electricity can become a
charge or encumbrance over the premises. An ancillary issue is whether such arrears can become a
charge on the property only through an express provision of law. Before we embark upon our
analysis, we clarify that it is unnecessary to deal with the submission of the auction purchasers
regarding registration under Section 17 of the Indian Registration Act 1908 for the conditions of
supply contained in a contract to constitute a charge. The decision of this court in M.L. Abdul
Jabbar Sahib v. M.V. Venkata Sastri & Sons,44 was limited to the extent that it holds that a charge
created by an act of parties under Section 100 of the Transfer of Property Act 1882 does not attract
the provisions of Section 59 of the Indian Registration Act 1908.
93. The contention of the auction purchasers is that arrears of electricity are not a charge on
property as they do not run with the land. They have relied on the decision in Ahmedabad Municipal
Corporation v. Haji Abdulgafur Haji Hussenbha45 to submit that enforcement of a charge against
the property in the hands of a transferee for value without notice of the charge does not arise, and
electricity dues are simply an unsecured debt. On the other hand, the Electric (1969) 1 SCC 573
(1971) 1 SCC 757 PART F Utilities submit that it is not even their case — in the absence of an express
provision of law — that there is any mortgage or charge over the property in the form that the
licensee would be a secured creditor.

94. Section 100 of the Transfer of Property Act 1882 contemplates two types of charges: charges
created by act of parties and charges arising by operation of law. It inter alia provides as follows:
“100. Charges: Where immoveable property of one person is by act of parties or
operation of law made security for the payment of money to another, and the
transaction does not amount to a mortgage, the latter person is said to have a charge
on the property; and all the provisions hereinbefore contained 1[which apply to a
simple mortgage shall, so far as may be, apply to such charge].
Nothing in this section applies to the charge of a trustee on the trust property for
expenses properly incurred in the execution of his trust, [and, save as otherwise
expressly provided by any law for the time being in force, no charge shall be enforced
against any property in the hands of a person to whom such property has been
transferred for consideration and without notice of the charge.” (emphasis supplied)
95. An encumbrance means a burden or charge upon property or a claim or lien upon an estate or
on the land. Encumbrance must be a charge on the property, which must run with the property. In
terms of the first paragraph of Section 100, when an immovable property of one party is pledged as
security for the payment of money to another, and the transaction does not constitute a mortgage,
the latter would acquire a charge over the property. All provisions that apply to a simple mortgage
are applicable to a charge. A charge is neither a sale nor a mortgage because it creates no interest in
or over an immovable property PART F but it is only a security for the payment of money.46 In
other words, a charge only results in the creation of a right of payment out of the property towards
the satisfaction of the debt or obligation in question.
96. The second paragraph of Section 100 provides an exception to the general proposition that a
charge runs with the land and can be enforced even if the property has passed into the hands of a
third party. It provides that a charge cannot be enforced against a property in the hands of a
transferee without notice. The words “save as otherwise expressly provided by any law for the time
being in force” indicate that a charge can be enforced against a transferee without notice when an
express provision of law exists. Hence, a charge cannot be enforced against a transferee if they have
no notice of the same, unless the requirement of such notice has been dispensed with by law.47
97. In AI Champdany Industries Ltd. v. Official Liquidator,48 this Court held that such a provision
of law should not merely create a charge, but it must expressly provide for the enforcement of a
charge against the property in the hands of a transferee for value without notice of the charge.
98. In Haji Abadulgafur Haji Husseinbhai (supra), this Court considered the doctrine of
constructive notice as provided under Section 100. In that case, the Municipal Corporation had a
charge on the property of a person who was in arrears of property tax. An auction purchaser, who
became the owner of the property, resisted the attempt of the Municipal Corporation to recover the
arrears of pending taxes in exercise of its charge on the ground that they were not aware Dattatreya
Shanker Mote v. Anand Chintaman Datar & Ors, (1974) 2 SCC 799 Dattatreya Shanker Mote v.
Anand Chintaman Datar, (1974) 2 SCC 799; State of Karnataka v. Shreyas Papers Pvt. Ltd, 2006 (1)

SCC 615 (2009) 4 SCC 486 PART F of the past municipal tax arrears. The Corporation argued that
the transferee was imputed with constructive knowledge of the charge created against the property
due to Section 141 of the Bombay Provincial Municipal Corporations Act 1949. The Court held
against the Municipal Corporation on the ground that in the facts of the case, the plaintiff did not
have constructive notice of the arrears of municipality.
99. While explaining the purport of Section 100, this Court held that the second half of Section 100
enacts a general prohibition and no charge can be enforced against property in the hands of a
transferee for consideration without notice of the charge. In terms of Section 100, an exception to
this rule must be expressly provided by law. The Court held that whether a transferee has actual or
constructive notice which satisfies the requirement of notice in the proviso to Section 100, must be
determined in the facts and circumstances of each case. This Court observed:
“4. This section in unambiguous language lays down that no charge is enforceable
against any property in the hands of a transferee for consideration without notice of
the charge except where it is otherwise expressly provided by any law for the time
being in force. The saving provision of law must expressly provide for enforcement of
a charge against the property in the hands of a transferee for value without notice of
the charge and not merely create a charge. …… The real core of the saving provision
of law must be not mere enforceability of the charge against the property charged but
enforceability of the charge against the said property in the hands of a transferee for
consideration without notice of the charge. Section 141 of the Bombay Municipal Act
is clearly not such a provision. The second contention fails and is repelled.” PART F
100. Counsel for the Electric Utilities have not referred to any provision in the plenary legislation of
the 2003 Act by which electricity dues would constitute a charge on the premises. The provisions of
the 1910 Act, 1948 Act, and the 2003 Act do not provide that the arrears of electricity dues would
constitute a charge on the property or that such a charge shall be enforceable against a transferee
without notice. It is pertinent to note that this Court has reiterated that arrears of electricity cannot
become a charge or encumbrance over the premises, in the absence of an express provision of law in
the 1910 Act, 1948 Act or 2003 Act.49
101. In Isha Marbles (supra), this Court observed that under the provisions of 1910 Act read with
1948 Act, electricity arrears do not create a charge over the property. It observed:
“56. From the above it is clear that the High Court has chosen to construe Section 24
of the Electricity Act correctly. There is no charge over the property. Where that
premises comes to be owned or occupied by the auction-purchaser, when such
purchaser seeks supply of electric energy he cannot be called upon to clear the past
arrears as a condition precedent to supply. What matters is the contract entered into
by the erstwhile consumer with the Board. The Board cannot seek the enforcement of
contractual liability against the third party. Of course, the bona fides of the sale may
not be relevant.”

46
102. Similarly, in Paschimanchal Vidyut Vitran Nigam (supra), this Court held that in the absence of
any contract to the contrary, the amount payable towards supply of electricity does not constitute a
charge on the premises.
1995 SCC (2) 648; AIR 2007 SC 2; (2010) 9 SCC 145 PART F
103. Consequently, in general law, a transferee of the premises cannot be made liable for the
outstanding dues of the previous owner since electricity arrears do not automatically become a
charge over the premises. Such an action is permissible only where the statutory conditions of
supply authorise the recovery of outstanding electricity dues from a subsequent purchaser claiming
fresh connection of electricity, or if there is an express provision of law providing for creation of a
statutory charge upon the transferee.
104. The next issue which falls for consideration is whether an electricity charge can be introduced
by way of statutory regulations or rules enacted by a regulatory commission under its rule making
power in the 2003 Act.
105. Counsel for the auction purchasers have relied on Deputy Commercial Tax Officer, Park Town
Division v. Sha Sukhraj Peerajee,50 and Indian Council of Legal Aid and Advice v. Bar Council of
India,51 to argue that a charge cannot be introduced by way of regulations as the subject matter is
not covered under Section 50 of the 2003 Act. It was further contended that only a fiscal levy by way
of statutory exaction could be fastened on land. In the context of electricity, it was urged that a state
legislation can provide for a charge on property only by providing for levy of a duty on consumption
or sale of electricity. Relying on India Cement Ltd & Ors v. State of Tamil Nadu52 and Al
Champdany Industries v. Official Liquidator53, it has been argued that only such a fiscal exaction
would get attached to the land. AIR 1968 SC 67 1995 (1) SCC 732 (1990) 1 SCC 12 (2009) 4 SCC 486
PART F
106. The subject of taxes on the consumption or sale of electricity within the State falls under Entry
53, List II of the Seventh Schedule of the Constitution. A number of States have enacted legislations
providing for the levy of electricity duty on consumption or supply of electricity. In these instances,
the legislature specifically provides that the duty payable under the state legislation shall be a first
charge on the amount recoverable by the licensee for the electrical energy supplied. Further, the
manner in which such charges are to be realised from the consumer is provided for in the state
legislation and relevant subordinate legislation. For example, the Kerala Electricity Duty Act 1963
and Kerala Electricity Duty Rules 1963 provide that the dues from a consumer towards electricity
duty create a first charge on the amounts recoverable for the energy consumed.
107. However, Entry 53 of List II of the Seventh Schedule does not have any bearing on the issues
involved in this batch of cases. This is because neither is any tax levied under Article 265 of the
Constitution nor is any levy imposed. It is not the case of the distribution licensees that the State
Commission under Section 50 of the 2003 Act has the power to provide for fiscal exactions.
K.C. Ninan vs Kerala State Electricity Board & ... on 19 May, 2023
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/160269658/
47
108. A subordinate rule or regulation, as in the case of the Electricity Supply Code framed by a
regulatory commission, can provide for a statutory charge to be fastened on the premises within
which consumption of electricity was effected. In terms of Section 50 of the 2003 Act, a State
Commission is empowered to provide for recovery of electricity charges, intervals for billing of
electricity charges, disconnection of supply of electricity for non-payment thereof, restoration of
supply of electricity and other cognate matters. In terms of Section PART F 181 of the 2003 Act, the
State Commission is empowered to make regulations and rules consistent with the Act which carry
out the provisions of the Act. As held in the preceding paragraphs, the rule making power contained
under Section 181 read with Section 50 is wide enough to enable the regulatory commission to
provide for a statutory charge in the absence of a provision in the plenary statute providing for
creation of such a charge. The State Commission is conferred with wide powers under the statutory
framework to provide for different mechanisms in the Electricity Supply Code for recovery of
electricity arrears of the previous owner. The recovery of electricity arrears may take effect either by
requiring a subsequent owner of premises to clear payment of outstanding dues as a condition
precedent for an electricity connection, or by deeming that any amount due to the licensee shall be a
first charge on the assets, or by any other reasonable condition.
109. In exercise of such power, Regulation 10.5 of the Maharashtra Electricity Supply Code 2005
provides that any charge for electricity or any other sum which remains unpaid by an erstwhile
owner constitutes a charge on the property and can be recovered from the transferee subject to the
permitted period specified therein. This provision spelt out in the present judgement is a mere
illustration of a subordinate rule wherein unpaid electricity dues constitute a charge on property and
can be recovered from a subsequent transferee.
110. Reliance by the auction purchasers on the decisions in India Cement Ltd (supra) or Indian
Council of Legal Aid and Advice (supra) render little assistance to their cause. The question in India
Cement Ltd (supra) was whether the State Legislature had competence to enact a cess on royalty on
PART F mineral rights under Article 246 read with Entry 49 of List II of the Seventh Schedule. In
Indian Council of Legal Aid and Advice (supra), this Court dealt with Rule 9 in Chapter III of Part VI
of the Bar Council of India Rules, which barred persons who have completed 45 years of age from
enrolment as an advocate. Both these decisions bear little relevance to the issue which has arisen in
the present appeals.
111. The auction purchasers have also relied on the decision in Sha Sukhraj Peerajee (supra). This
Court held that Rule 21-A framed by the State Government under Section 19 of the Madras General
Sales Tax Act, 1939 was ultra vires. In terms of Rule 21-A, a purchaser of a business carried on by a
‘dealer’ could be made liable for arrears of sales tax due from the dealer in respect of transactions of
sale which took place before the transfer. This Court held that the rule making power under Section
19 could not be used to enlarge the scope of recovery and payment of tax from some person other
than a ‘dealer’ under the Act. Section 10, inserted by the Amendment Act of 1956, provided that the
outstanding amount on the date of default was made a charge on the property of the person liable to
pay tax. This Court did not consider the import of Section 10 of the Act since the business was
transferred before the amending Act came into force. The ratio of the case is neither helpful nor
applicable in the instant case, since this Court was dealing with the specific provisions of the Madras
K.C. Ninan vs Kerala State Electricity Board & ... on 19 May, 2023
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/160269658/
48
General Sales Tax Act 1939.
112. The provisions of the statute and statutory conditions of supply need to be examined to
determine whether the conditions of supply provide for the creation of a charge in terms of Section
100 of the Transfer of Property Act, 1882. Once it PART F is established that a statutory charge is
created and required notice was given, the charge attaches to the property and the licensee is
entitled to recover the unpaid electricity dues by proceeding against the premises. Consequent to the
charge created, Article 62 of the Indian Limitation Act, 1963 would come into play. Article 62 of the
Limitation Act relates to enforcing the payment of money procured by mortgaged or otherwise
charged upon the immoveable property. The electricity utilities would get a period of twelve years to
recover the dues charged on the immoveable property from the date when the money payable
became due.
113. In light of the above discussion, we are of the opinion that the electricity utilities can create a
charge by framing subordinate legislation or statutory conditions of supply enabling recovery of
electricity arrears from a subsequent transferee. Such a condition is rooted in the importance of
protecting electricity which is a public good. Public utilities invest huge amounts of capital and
infrastructure in providing electricity supply. The failure or inability to recover outstanding
electricity dues of the premises would negatively impact the functioning of such public utilities and
licensees. In the larger public interest, conditions are incorporated in subordinate legislation
whereby Electric Utilities can recoup electricity arrears. Recoupment of electricity arrears is
necessary to provide funding and investment in laying down new infrastructure and maintaining the
existing infrastructure. In the absence of such a provision, Electric Utilities would be left without
any recourse and would be compelled to grant a fresh electricity connection, even when huge arrears
of electricity are outstanding. Besides impacting on the financial health of the Utilities, this would
impact the wider body of consumers.
PART F VI. Implication of Section 56(2) on recovery of electricity dues by Electric Utilities
114. The Electric Utilities have submitted that Section 56 of the 2003 Act only deals with the right of
the licensee to disconnect supply. Explaining the scope of the relevant provision, it has been
submitted that Section 56 sets out different timelines, namely (a) when the disconnection can be
made i.e., when payment of charges is not made after giving requisite notice; (b) how long the
disconnection can be maintained i.e., so long as the outstanding dues remain; and (c) when it is to
be restored i.e., immediately when the outstanding dues are paid. Reliance has been placed on
Ajmer Vidyut Vitran Nigam Limited v. Rahamatullah Khan,54 and M/s Prem Cortex v. Uttar
Haryana Bijli Vitran Nigam Limited55 to contend that the use of the expression “under this section”
in Section 56(2) means that the avenue of effecting disconnection to recover money cannot be
resorted to after the limitation period. It is further contended that Section 56 does not bar the
recovery of pending charges through other avenues of recovery in accordance with law. The
licensees urge that civil remedies and statutory power to recover electricity can be utilised
simultaneously. It was urged that Section 56 does not restrict the right of the licensee to insist on
payment of the arrears of charges incurred on the premises, from a subsequent applicant for a fresh
connection to the same premises.
K.C. Ninan vs Kerala State Electricity Board & ... on 19 May, 2023
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/160269658/
49
115. On the implication of the two-year limitation period under Section 56(2), it is submitted that (i)
the limitation is with reference to the bar on disconnection by the licensee; (ii) no limitation is
provided under Section 56 after the electricity is (2020) 4 SCC 650 Judgment dt. 5.10.2021 in CA
7235 of 2009 PART F discontinued for non-payment of dues; (iii) a valid and subsisting money
decree in favour of the Electricity Board against the erstwhile owner of the premises would not be
affected by the limitation period of two years; (iv) no time limit has been provided for cessation of
the right of the licensee to demand past dues for giving a new connection to the premises; and (v)
the right of the licensee not to give a connection till the outstanding dues are cleared is a continuing
right and cannot be said to be extinguished.
116. On the other hand counsel representing the auction purchasers have urged that (i) the period of
limitation under Section 56(2), which begins with a non obstante clause, bars the recovery of
outstanding electricity dues from successful auction purchasers who apply for a new connection for
the supply of electricity from the licensee; (ii) two conditions need to be fulfilled to get over the
embargo on the recovery of a sum due from any consumer, after a period of two years from the date
when such sum became first due, namely (a) such sum has been shown continuously as recoverable
as arrears of charges for electricity supplied, and (b) the licensee shall not cut off the supply of the
electricity; (iii) the conditions of supply, being subordinate legislation, cannot override the duty cast
upon the licensee, and dues cannot be recoverable either in a manner or over and above what is
provided for in the Section 56 (2); and (iv) any alternative interpretation would render the bar under
Section 56(2) meaningless, and the conditions of supply could be used to resurrect time barred
claims as held in State of Kerala v. VT Kallianikutty.56 (1999) 3 SCC 657 PART F
117. The power to discontinue supply to a consumer is dealt with in Section 56 of the 2003 Act. The
provision is extracted below:
“Section 56: Disconnection of supply in default of payment (1) Where any person
neglects to pay any charge for electricity or any sum other than a charge for electricity
due from him to a licensee or the generating company in respect of supply,
transmission or distribution or wheeling of electricity to him, the licensee or the
generating company may, after giving not less than fifteen clear days’ notice in
writing, to such person and without prejudice to his rights to recover such charge or
other sum by suit, cut off the supply of electricity and for that purpose cut or
disconnect any electric supply line or other works being the property of such licensee
or the generating company through which electricity may have been supplied,
transmitted, distributed or wheeled and may discontinue the supply until such charge
or other sum, together with any expenses incurred by him in cutting off and
reconnecting the supply, are paid, but no longer:
Provided that the supply of electricity shall not be cut off if such person deposits,
under protest, -
(a) an amount equal to the sum claimed from him, or
K.C. Ninan vs Kerala State Electricity Board & ... on 19 May, 2023
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/160269658/
50
(b) the electricity charges due from him for each month calculated on the basis of
average charge for electricity paid by him during the preceding six months, whichever
is less, pending disposal of any dispute between him and the licensee.
(2) Notwithstanding anything contained in any other law for the time being in force, no sum due
from any consumer, under this section shall be recoverable after the period of two years from the
date when such sum became first due unless such sum has been shown continuously as recoverable
as arrear of charges for electricity supplied and the licensee shall not cut off the supply of the
electricity.” (emphasis supplied) PART F
118. Section 56 falls under Part VI which is titled “Distribution of Electricity”. Section 56 provides
for disconnection of electrical supply in case there is a default in payment of electricity charges.
119. The power to disconnect is a drastic step which can be resorted to only when there is a neglect
on the part of the consumer to pay the electricity charges or dues owed to the licensee or a
generating company, as the case may be. Section 56(1) provides that where any person neglects to
pay any charge for electricity or any sum other than a charge for electricity due from him to a
licensee or a generating company, the licensee or generating company may after giving a written
notice of fifteen days, disconnect the supply of electricity, until such charges, including the expenses
incurred are paid. The power to disconnect electricity is conditioned on the fulfilment of the
conditions stipulated. The cutting off or disconnection is without prejudice to the rights of the
distribution licensee to recover such charge or other sums by other permissible modes of recovery.
The proviso to Section 56(1) carves out an exception by providing that electricity supply will not be
cut off if the consumer, “under protest”, either deposits the amount claimed or deposits the average
charges paid during the preceding six months.
120. The statutory right of the licensee or the generating company to disconnect the supply of
electricity is subject to the period of limitation of two years provided by Section 56(2). Section 56(2)
provides that notwithstanding anything contained in any other law for the time being in force, no
sum due from any consumer “under this section” shall be recoverable after a period of two years
from the date PART F when such sum became first due unless such sum has been shown
continuously as recoverable as arrears of charges for electricity supplied and the licensee shall not
cut off the supply of electricity. The limitation of two years is limited to recovery of sums under
Section 56. This is evident by the use of the expression, “under this section”.
121. The first issue pertains to the simultaneous exercise of statutory and civil remedies by the
licensing authority to recover electricity arrears. The liability to pay electricity charges is a statutory
liability and Section 56 provides the consequences when a consumer neglects to pay any charge for
electricity or any sum other than a charge for electricity due from him. Section 56(1) provides that
the power of the licensee to disconnect electrical supply when a consumer is in default of payment is
“without prejudice to his rights to recover such charge or other sum by suit”. This means that the
licensee can exercise both its statutory remedy to disconnect as well as a civil remedy to institute a
suit for recovery against the consumer since the licensee will not necessarily obtain the amount due
from the consumer by disconnecting the supply. In its decision in Bihar SEB v. Iceberg Industries
K.C. Ninan vs Kerala State Electricity Board & ... on 19 May, 2023
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/160269658/
51
Ltd.,57 this Court has held that the power to disconnect supply under Section 56 is a special power
given to the supplier in addition to the normal mode of recovery by instituting a suit. The power to
disconnect the supply of electricity as a consequence of the non-payment of dues and as a method to
recover dues is supplemental to the right of the licensee to institute a suit or other proceedings for
the recovery of dues on account of electrical charges.
(2020) 20 SCC 745 PART F
122. Section 56(1) of the 2003 Act is pari materia to Section 24 of the 1910 Act. Section 24 of the
1910 Act empowered the Electricity Board to issue a demand and to discontinue supply to
consumers who neglected to pay charges, without prejudice to the right to recover such charges or
other sums by way of a suit. The import of Section 24 was considered by this Court in Isha Marbles
(supra), where it was observed that the action of cutting off electricity supply after service of the
notice as prescribed under Section 24 was in addition to the general remedy of filing a suit for
recovery.
123. In M/s Swastic Industries v. Maharashtra State Electricity Board,58 this Court held that the
right to discontinue supply of energy under Section 24 was not taken away by Section 60A of the
1948 Act, which provided an option to the Electricity Board to file a suit within the period of
limitation stipulated there. This Court observed that:
“5. It would, thus, be clear that the right to recover the charges is one part of it and
right to discontinue supply of electrical energy to the consumer who neglects to pay
charges is another part of it. The right to file a suit is a matter of option given to the
licensee, the Electricity Board.
Therefore, the mere fact that there is a right given to the Board to file the suit and the limitation has
been prescribed to file the suit, it does not take away the right conferred on the Board under Section
24 to make demand for payment of the charges and on neglecting to pay the same they have the
power to discontinue the supply or cut off the supply, as the case may be, when the consumer
neglects to pay the charges. The intendment appears to be that the obligations are mutual….”
(emphasis supplied) (1997) 9 SCC 465 PART F Hence, the power to initiate recovery proceedings by
filing a suit against the defaulting consumer is independent of the power to disconnect electrical
supply as a means of recovery.
124. The second issue pertains to the implication of the period of two years provided in Section
56(2) on the civil remedies of Utilities to recover electricity dues. Section 56(2), which begins with a
non obstante clause, provides a limitation of two years for recovery of dues by the licensee through
the means of disconnecting electrical supply. It puts a restriction on the right of the licensee to
recover any sum due from a consumer under Section 56 after a period of two years from the date
when such sum became first due. If this provision is invoked against a consumer after two years, the
action will be permissible when the sum, which was first due, has been shown continuously as
recoverable as arrears of charges for electricity supplied. Under Section 56, the liability to pay arises
on the consumption of electricity and the obligation to pay arises when a bill is issued by the licensee
K.C. Ninan vs Kerala State Electricity Board & ... on 19 May, 2023
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/160269658/
52
for the first time. Accordingly, the period of limitation of two years starts only after issuance of the
bill.
125. Before we deal with the implication of Section 56(2) on the civil remedies available to a
licensee, it is important to clarify that when the liability incurred by a consumer is prior to the
period when the 2003 Act came into force, then the bar of limitation under Section 56(2) is not
applicable. In Kusumam Hotels Pvt Ltd v. Kerala State Electricity Board,59 this Court has held that
Section 56(2) applies after the 2003 Act came into force and the bar of limitation under Section
56(2) would not apply to a liability incurred by the consumer prior to the (2008) 12 SCC 213 PART F
enforcement of the Act. In terms of Section 6 of the General Clauses Act 1897, the liability incurred
under the previous enactment would continue and the claim of the licensee to recover electricity
would be governed by the regulatory framework which was in existence prior to the enforcement of
the 2003 Act.
126. In its report dated 19 December 2002, the Standing Committee of Energy opined that the
restriction for recovery of arrears under Section 56 was considered necessary to protect the
consumer from arbitrary billings.60 In other words, the enactment of Section 56(2) was to address
the mischief of arbitrary billings. Hence, Section 56(2) was incorporated to ensure that a licensee
does not abuse its special power of disconnection of electrical supply. Section 56(2) ensures that a
licensee does not have the liberty to arbitrarily impose a bill after a long period and then recover
such a huge amount through the drastic step of disconnection of electrical supply.
127. In Rahamatullah Khan (supra), a two judge Bench of this Court dealt with the applicability of
the period of limitation provided by Section 56(2) on an additional or supplementary demand raised
by the licensee. A consumer was billed under a particular tariff but after an audit, it was discovered
that a different tariff code should have been applied. An additional bill was subsequently raised in
2014 for the period from July 2009 to September 2011. Section 56(2) was interpreted not to
preclude the licensee from raising a supplementary demand after the expiry of the period of
limitation under Section 56(2) in the case of a mistake or a bona fide error. However, it did not
empower the licensee to take recourse to the coercive measure of disconnection of electricity supply
for Standing Committee of Energy- Thirteenth Lok Sabha, The Electricity Bill 2001- Thirsty First
Report, Ministry of Power (2002) PART F recovery of the additional demand. This Court held that
the bar of limitation of two years does not preclude the licensee from resorting to other modes of
recovery of electricity arrears. The court observed:
“7.4 Sub-section (1) of Section 56 confers a statutory right to the licensee company to
disconnect the supply of electricity, if the consumer neglects to pay the electricity
dues. This statutory right is subject to the period of limitation of two years provided
by sub- section (2) of Section 56 of the Act 7.5 The period of limitation of two years
would commence from the date on which the electricity charges became “first due”
under sub-section (2) of Section 56. This provision restricts the right of the licensee
company to disconnect electricity supply due to non-payment of dues by the
consumer, unless such sum has been shown continuously to be recoverable as arrears
of electricity supplied, in the bills raised for the past period. If the licensee company
K.C. Ninan vs Kerala State Electricity Board & ... on 19 May, 2023
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/160269658/
53
were to be allowed to disconnect electricity supply after the expiry of the limitation
period of two years after the sum became “first due”, it would defeat the object of
Section 56(2).
8. Section 56(2) however, does not preclude the licensee company from raising a
supplementary demand after the expiry of the limitation period of two years. It only
restricts the right of the licensee to disconnect electricity supply due to non-payment
of dues after the period of limitation of two years has expired, nor does it restrict
other modes of recovery which may be initiated by the licensee company for recovery
of a supplementary demand.
9. Applying the aforesaid ratio to the facts of the present case, the licensee company
raised an additional demand on 18-3-2014 for the period July 2009 to September
2011. The licensee company discovered the mistake of billing under the wrong Tariff
Code on 18-3-2014. The limitation period of two years under Section 56(2) had by
then already expired.
9.1. Section 56(2) did not preclude the licensee company from raising an additional or
supplementary demand after the expiry of the limitation period under Section 56(2) in the case
PART F of a mistake or bona fide error. It did not, however, empower the licensee company to take
recourse to the coercive measure of disconnection of electricity supply, for recovery of the additional
demand.” (emphasis supplied)
128. The exposition of law by this Court in Rahamatullah Khan (supra) was considered by a
coordinate bench in Prem Cortex (supra). A consumer was served with a short assessment notice
and the Court had to consider whether short billing and the subsequent raising of an additional
demand would tantamount to a deficiency of service. This Court observed that the bar contemplated
in Section 56 operates on two distinct rights of the licensee, namely, the right to recover and the
right to disconnect. This Court observed that under the law of limitation, the remedy and not the
right is extinguished. The bar with reference to the remedy of disconnection was held to be an
exception to the law of limitation. This Court further considered the impact of Section 56(1) on
Section 56(2) and observed:
“15. Therefore, the bar actually operates on two distinct rights of the licensee, namely,
(i) the right to recover; and (ii) the right to disconnect. The bar with reference to the
enforcement of the right to disconnect, is actually an exception to the law of
limitation. Under the law of limitation, what is extinguished is the remedy and not
the right. To be precise, what is extinguished by the law of limitation, is the remedy
through a court of law and not a remedy available, if any, de hors through a court of
law. However, section 56(2) bars not merely the normal remedy of recovery but also
bars the remedy of disconnection. This is why we think that the second part of
Section 56(2) is an exception to the law of limitation.

PART F
23. Coming to the second aspect, namely, the impact of Sub-section (1) on Sub-
section (2) of Section 56, it is seen that the bottom line of Subsection (1) is the negligence of any
person to pay any charge for electricity. Sub-section (1) starts with the words “where any person
neglects to pay any charge for electricity or any sum other than a charge for electricity due from
him”.
24. Sub-section (2) uses the words “no sum due from any consumer under this Section”. Therefore,
the bar under Sub-section (2) is relatable to the sum due under Section 56. This naturally takes us to
Sub-
section (1) which deals specifically with the negligence on the part of a person to pay any charge for
electricity or any sum other than a charge for electricity. What is covered by section 56, under
sub-section (1), is the negligence on the part of a person to pay for electricity and not anything else
nor any negligence on the part of the licensee.” (emphasis supplied)
129. The period of limitation under Section 56(2) is relatable to the sum due under Section 56. The
sum due under Section 56 relates to the sum due on account of the negligence of a person to pay for
electricity. Section 56(2) provides that such sum due would not be recoverable after the period of
two years from when such sum became first due. The means of recovery provided under Section 56
relate to the remedy of disconnection of electric supply. The right to recover still subsists.
130. We may also briefly deal with the objection of the auction purchasers that the conditions of
supply cannot be used to resurrect time barred debts. Counsel placed reliance on VT Kallianikutty
(supra), where it was held that a time barred debt cannot be recovered by taking recourse to the
provisions of the Kerala Revenue Recovery Act. This decision is not helpful to the auction
purchasers in PART F the present batch of cases. In that case, a three-judge Bench of this Court
while dealing with agricultural loans extended by the Kerala Finance Corporation, held that since
the Kerala Revenue Recovery Act does not create a new right, a person could not claim the recovery
of amounts which are not legally recoverable. In reaching its decision, this Court, however, reasoned
that the statute of limitation bars the remedy by way of a suit beyond a certain time period, without
touching the right to recover the loan. The right remains untouched and it can be exercised in any
other suitable manner provided.
131. We therefore, reject the submission of the auction purchasers that the recovery of outstanding
electricity arrears either by instituting a civil suit against the erstwhile consumer or from a
subsequent transferee in exercise of statutory power under the relevant conditions of supply is
barred on the ground of limitation under Section 56(2) of the 2003 Act. Accordingly, while the bar
of limitation under Section 56(2) restricts the remedy of disconnection under Section 56, the
licensee is entitled to recover electricity arrears through civil remedies or in exercise of its statutory
power under the conditions of supply. VII. Implication of the sale of premises on “as is where is”
basis, with or without reference to electricity arrears of the premises
K.C. Ninan vs Kerala State Electricity Board & ... on 19 May, 2023
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/160269658/
55
132. The Electric Utilities have urged that (i) the auction purchasers were put to notice of the
requirement of the clearance of dues; (ii) the public auction-sales of premises were held on an “as is
where is” basis; (iii) this would include a condition of acknowledging all liabilities in respect of the
premises, with or without a specific reference of payment of electricity dues; and (iv) in a sale arising
out of PART F commercial transactions, the auction purchaser is required to undertake due
diligence of outstanding dues which are premises specific. On the other hand, the auction
purchasers submitted that (i) a condition such as “as is where is” is a feature of physical property
and does not extend to claims which are not charges or other encumbrances running with land; (ii)
the argument finds support in the decisions in Punjab Urban Planning and Development Authority
v. Raghu Nath Gupta61 and Delhi Development Authority v. Kenneth Builders and Developers Pvt
Limited62; (iii) electricity dues cannot be ascertained merely by looking at a property; and (iv) there
was no obligation on the applicants to ascertain the electricity dues payable, more so in view of the
judgement in the Isha Marbles (supra).
133. In the present batch of cases, the premises were sold in auction sales generally held on an “as is
where is” basis. A sale on “as is where is basis” postulates that the purchaser would be acquiring the
asset with all its existing rights, obligations and liabilities. When a property is sold on an “as is
where is” basis, encumbrances on the property stand transferred to the purchaser upon the sale.
134. In U.T. Chandigarh Administration v. Amarjeet Singh63, a two-judge Bench of this Court
explained the characteristics of a public auction in the context of the maintainability of a consumer
complaint. This Court held that where existing sites are put up for sale or lease by public auction and
the sale is confirmed in favour of the highest bidder, the resultant contract relates to sale or (2012) 8
SCC 197 (2016) 13 SCC 561 (2009) 4 SCC 660 PART F lease of immovable property, and not a
provision of service or sale of goods. This Court delved into the nature of public auctions and opined
on the implications of an auction conducted on an “as is where is basis”, where an auction purchaser
is expected to exercise due diligence with regard to the condition of a site. The Court observed:
“19. …. In a public auction of sites, the position is completely different. A person
interested can inspect the sites offered and choose the site which he wants to acquire
and participate in the auction only in regard to such site. Before bidding in the
auction, he knows or is in a position to ascertain, the condition and situation of the
site. He knows about the existence or lack of amenities. The auction is on `as is where
is basis'. With such knowledge, he participates in the auction and offers a particular
bid. There is no compulsion that he should offer a particular price. When the sites
auctioned are existing sites, without any assurance/representation relating to
amenities, there is no question of deficiency of service or denial of service. Where the
bidder has a choice and option in regard to the site and price and when there is no
assurance of any facility or amenity, the question of the owner of the site becoming a
service provider, does not arise…
20. Where there is a public auction without assuring any specific or particular
amenities, and the prospective purchaser/lessee participates in the auction after
having an opportunity of examining the site, the bid in the auction is made keeping in
K.C. Ninan vs Kerala State Electricity Board & ... on 19 May, 2023
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/160269658/
56
view the existing situation, position and condition of the site. If all amenities are
available, he would offer a higher amount. If there are no amenities, or if the site
suffers from any disadvantages, he would offer a lesser amount, or may not
participate in the auction. Once with open eyes, a person participates in an auction,
he cannot thereafter be heard to say that he would not pay the balance of the
price/premium or the stipulated interest on the delayed payment, or the ground rent,
on the ground that the site suffers from certain PART F disadvantages or on the
ground that amenities are not provided….” (emphasis supplied)
135. In Raghu Nath Gupta (supra),64 this Court held that a successful auction purchaser of
commercial plots sold with a superimposed condition of “as is where is” basis is estopped from later
contending that he is not bound by the terms and conditions of the auction notice or that the seller
had not provided basic amenities. The Court relied on the terms and conditions, specifically Clause
25, stipulated in the auction notice published by Punjab Urban Planning and Development
Authority in reaching its conclusion and held that the auction notice would have considerable
bearing in resolving the dispute. Clause 25 of the auction notice provided that the site was offered on
“as is where is” basis and the Authority would not be responsible for levelling the site or removing
structures, if any, thereon. The phrase “as is where is” was explained by this Court in the following
terms:
“14. We notice that the respondents had accepted the commercial plots with the open
eyes, subject to the above mentioned conditions. Evidently, the commercial plots
were allotted on “as is where is” basis. The allottees would have ascertained the
facilities available at the time of auction and after having accepted the commercial
plots on “as is where is” basis, they cannot be heard to contend that PUDA had not
provided the basic amenities like parking, lights, roads, water, sewerage etc. If the
allottees were not interested in taking the commercial plots on “as is where is” basis,
they should not have accepted the allotment and after having accepted the allotment
on “as is where is” basis, they are estopped from contending that the basic amenities
like parking, lights, roads, water, (2012) 8 SCC 197 PART F sewerage etc. were not
provided by PUDA when the plots were allotted….” (emphasis supplied)
136. In Kenneth Builders and Developers (supra), in the circumstances arising in that particular
case, this Court refused to accept the seller’s reliance on the “as is where is” condition and held that
refusal of the Delhi Pollution Control Committee,65 to grant permission to the auction purchaser,
frustrated the Development Agreement which was entered into between the seller, Delhi
Development Authority,66 and the builder. DDA had held an auction on an “as is where is” basis for
involving the private sector for the development of a project land. The bid was accepted and a
Development Agreement was entered between DDA and the builder. However, when the builder
attempted to carry out construction activity, it was prohibited by DPCC leading to an impasse in the
development activity. The terms and conditions of auction specifically mentioned that there was a
presumption that the intending purchaser had inspected the site and had familiarised himself with
prevalent conditions in all respects including the status of infrastructural facilities available before
giving its bid. Under Clause 6 of the Development Agreement, it was the responsibility of the
K.C. Ninan vs Kerala State Electricity Board & ... on 19 May, 2023
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/160269658/
57
developer to get various approvals and clearances from governmental departments. Clause 11 of the
Development Agreement further stipulated that the builder was deemed to have inspected the site
and its surroundings and checked the information available. This Court held that the auction sale on
an “as is where is” basis and the specific clauses in the Development Agreement “related only to
physical “DPCC” “DDA” PART F issues pertaining to the project land and ancillary or peripheral
legal issues pertaining to the actual construction activity”. It was observed:
“34. When the DDA informed Kenneth Builders that the project land was available on
an “as is where is basis” and that it was the responsibility of the developer to obtain
all clearances, the conditions related only to physical issues pertaining to the project
land and ancillary or peripheral legal issues pertaining to the actual construction
activity, such as compliance with the building bye-laws, environmental clearances
etc. The terms and conditions of “as is where is” or environmental clearances
emphasized by learned counsel for the DDA certainly did not extend to
commencement of construction activity prohibited by law except after obtaining
permission of the Ridge Management Board and this Court. On the contrary, it was
the obligation of the DDA to ensure that the initial path for commencement of
construction was clear, the rest being the responsibility of the developer. The failure
of the DDA to provide a clear passage due to an intervening circumstance beyond its
contemplation went to the foundation of implementation of the contract with
Kenneth Builders and that is what frustrated its implementation.
35. Reliance by the learned counsel for DDA on the “as is where is” concept as well as
Clause 6 and 11 of the Development Agreement in this context is misplaced. As
mentioned above, this primarily pertains to physical issues at site….” (emphasis
supplied)
137. Reliance placed by the auction purchasers on Raghu Nath Gupta (supra) and Kenneth Builders
and Developers (supra) to contend that “as is where is” is a feature of physical property, limited to
encumbrances or charges running with land, is misconceived. In both the cases relied upon by the
auction purchasers, the judgments were rendered on the peculiar facts at hand. In Raghu Nath
Gupta (supra) this Court was dealing with the availability of basic facilities like PART F parking,
lights, roads, water and sewerage, but the application of the doctrine of “as is where is” was not
limited to only physical features of the property. Further, in Kenneth Builders and Developers
(supra) based on the facts, this Court opined that a sale on “as is where is” could not be interpreted
to mean that the auction purchaser would be responsible to take permission for the initial
commencement of construction itself, which was the obligation of the DDA. The observation of this
Court that “this primarily pertains to physical issues at site” was limited to specific clauses in the
Development Agreement.
138. Thus, the implication of the expression “as is where is” or “as is what is basis” or “as is where is,
whatever there is and without recourse basis” is not limited to the physical condition of the
property, but extends to the condition of the title of the property and the extent and state of
whatever claims, rights and dues affect the property, unless stated otherwise in the contract. The
K.C. Ninan vs Kerala State Electricity Board & ... on 19 May, 2023
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/160269658/
58
implication of the expression is that every intending bidder is put on notice that the seller does not
undertake any responsibility to procure permission in respect of the property offered for sale or any
liability for the payment of dues, like water/service charges, electricity dues for power connection
and taxes of the local authorities, among others.
139. The view which we take finds support in the judgments of this Court in Paramount Polymers
(supra) and Srigdhaa Beverages (supra). In Paramount Polymers (supra), the premises of the
erstwhile owner were sold under the State Financial Corporations Act 1951 on an “as is where is”
basis. This Court held that an auction purchaser cannot be considered an ignorant party and a
reasonable PART F enquiry would have put it on notice of the subsistence of such a liability. It was
observed:
“9. …. Before submitting its bid to the Financial Corporation the first respondent
would certainly have inspected the premises and could have come to know that power
connection to the premises had been snapped and this information should have put it
on reasonable enquiry about the reasons for the power disconnection leading to the
information that the previous owner of the undertaking or consumer was in default.
Moreover, the appellant had clearly written to the Financial Corporation even before
the sale was advertised by it, informing it that a sum of Rs.64,23,695/- was due
towards electricity charges to the appellant and when selling the undertaking, that
amount had to be provided for or kept in mind. Therefore, any reasonable enquiry by
the first respondent as a prudent buyer would have put it on notice of the subsistence
of such a liability. The sale was also on 'as is where is' basis…..”
140. In Srigdhaa Beverages (supra), this Court was considering an auction sale under the
Securitisation and Reconstruction of Financial Assets and Enforcement of Security Interest Act
2002.67 The Court analysed Clauses 24 and 26 of the auction notice, which stipulated an “as is
where is” sale with respect to all statutory dues and absolved the authorised officer of all liabilities
for any charge, encumbrances and dues, including electricity dues. It concluded that the auction
purchaser was “clearly put to notice” since there was a specific mention of the quantification of dues
of various accounts including electricity dues. On the liability of the past owners to bear electricity
dues when the sale is on “as is where is” and existence of electricity dues is specifically mentioned,
this Court “SARFAESI Act” PART F categorically held that the auction purchasers were bound to
inspect the premises and provide for the dues in all respects. This Court observed:
“16.2. Where, as in cases of the E-auction notice in question, the existence of
electricity dues, whether quantified or not, has been specifically mentioned as a
liability of the purchaser and the sale is on “AS IS WHERE IS, WHATEVER THERE
IS AND WITHOUT RECOURSE BASIS”, there can be no doubt that the liability to
pay electricity dues exists on the respondent (purchaser).”
141. To conclude, all prospective auction purchasers are put on notice of the liability to pay the
pending dues when an appropriate “as is where is” clause is incorporated in the auction sale
agreement. It is for the intending auction purchaser to satisfy themselves in all respects about
K.C. Ninan vs Kerala State Electricity Board & ... on 19 May, 2023
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/160269658/
59
circumstances such as title, encumbrances and pending statutory dues in respect of the property
they propose to purchase. In a public auction sale, auction purchasers have the opportunity to
inspect the premises and ascertain the facilities available, including whether electricity is supplied to
the premises. Information about the disconnection of power is easily discoverable with due
diligence, which puts a prudent auction purchaser on a reasonable enquiry about the reasons for the
disconnection. When electricity supply to a premises has been disconnected, it would be implausible
for the purchaser to assert that they were oblivious of the existence of outstanding electricity dues.
142. In terms of the legal doctrine of caveat emptor, it becomes the duty of the buyer to exercise due
diligence. A seller is not under an obligation to disclose patent defects of which a buyer has actual or
constructive notice in terms of Section 3 of the Transfer of Property act, 1882. However, in terms of
Section PART G 55(1)(a), in the absence of a contract to the contrary, the seller is under an
obligation to disclose material defects in the property or in the seller’s title thereto of which he is
aware and which a buyer could not with ordinary care discover for himself.
143. While examining the effect of an “as is where is” clause, the facts and circumstances of each
case individually, along with the terminology of the clauses governing the auction sales must be
taken into consideration, to arrive at an equitable decision.
G. Application: Facts of Individual Cases
144. Before we apply the above analysis to the facts of the individual cases, it needs to be clarified
that each case involves, in one way or another, application of the conditions of supply or Electricity
Supply Code. At the outset, we note that the relevant date to determine the applicability of the
conditions of supply or Electricity Supply Code is the date on which the auction purchaser applied
for a fresh connection or reconnection for supply of electricity to the premises. The cause of action
arises when a fresh connection or reconnection is sought by the auction purchaser. This has also
been reiterated in the decision of this Court in Paramount Polymers (supra). This Court observed:
“11. ….. We are also not in a position to agree with the High Court that the relevant
date is the date of sale of the undertaking by the Financial Corporation to the first
respondent. The insertion of clause 21-A was circulated by the communication dated
27-11-
2001 and it was subsequently followed by the formal notification in terms of Section 49 of the
Supply Act read with Section 79(j) of that Act. The first respondent having applied for a fresh
connection PART G only on 1-1-2002, the application would be governed by the Terms and
Conditions including the term inserted on 27-11-2001, as subsequently formally notified. In the writ
petition filed on 27-2- 2002 in that behalf, the Court could not have come to the conclusion that the
application made by the first respondent was not governed by the amended Terms and Conditions
of Supply including clause 21-A thereof…..On our interpretation of clause 21-A of the Terms and
Conditions of Supply as inserted with particular reference to sub-clauses (b) and (c) thereof, we are
of the view that the said sub-clauses clearly applied to the first respondent when it made an
application on 1-1-2002 seeking a fresh connection for the premises.” (emphasis supplied)

Considering the facts of the nineteen cases, we decide the appeals in the following manner:
I. Kerala
145. The KSEB in exercise of powers conferred under Section 49 and Section 79(j) of the 1948 Act
framed regulations relating to Conditions of Supply of Electrical Energy. The regulations were
published in the Gazette on 15 December 1989 and came into force with effect from 1 January 1990.
Clause 15 deals with the agreement for a service connection. The relevant clause, with which we are
concerned, is extracted below:
“15. Agreement for Service Connection 15(c): When there is transfer of ownership or
right of occupancy of the premises the registered consumer shall intimate the transfer
of right of occupancy of the premises within 7 days to the Assistant
Engineer/Assistant Executive Engineer concerned. On such intimation having been
received the service shall be disconnected. If PART G the transferee desires to enjoy
service connection, he shall pay off the dues to the Board and apply for transfer of
ownership of service connection within 15 days and execute fresh agreement and
furnish additional security. New consumer number shall be allotted in such cases
cancelling the previous number.
15(d): All dues to the Board from a consumer shall be the first charge on the assets of
the consumer. All dues including penalty shall be realized as public revenue due on
land.
15(e): Reconnection or new connection shall not be given into any premises where
there are arrears on any account due to the Board pending payment, unless the
arrears including penalty, if, any, are cleared in advance (if the new owner/occupier/
allottee remits the amount due from the previous consumer, the Board shall provide
re-connection or new connection depending on whether the service remains
disconnected/dismantled, as the case may be. The amount so remitted will be
adjusted against the dues from the previous consumer if the Board gets the full dues
from the previous consumer through R.R. action or other legal proceedings the
amount remitted by the new owner/occupier to whom connection has been effected
shall be refunded. But the amount already remitted by him/her shall not bear any
interest)”
146. In terms of Clause 15(c), when there is a transfer of ownership or right of occupancy of the
premises, the registered consumer shall intimate the transfer of the right of occupancy of the
premises within seven days to the officer concerned. On such intimation being received, the service
shall be disconnected. If the transferee desires a service connection, they shall pay off the dues and
apply for transfer of the ownership of the service connection. In terms of Clause 15(d), all dues to the
KSEB from a consumer shall be the first charge on the assets of the consumer. In terms of Clause
15(e), a new connection or reconnection shall not PART G be given to any premises where there are
arrears on any account unless they are cleared in advance.

147. The validity of Clause 15(e) was upheld by a Full Bench decision of the Kerala High Court in
Suraj v. KSEB.68 The High Court upheld the validity of the said regulation on the ground that it is
unjust to compel the Board to supply electricity to the very same premises without the arrears of the
previous owner or occupier being cleared. The High Court observed:
“8. Regulations make no distinction between an auction purchaser and others in the
matter of supply of electricity. Regulations 15(d) and (e) have been incorporated with
a purpose, or else by successive transfer of the premises the Board's right to recover
the amount from the previous consumers as well as from the assets could be
effectively defeated at the same time the Board is called upon to provide electricity to
the same premises. Regulation 15(e) has a reasonable nexus with the object sought to
be achieved, that is to save public property so as to subserve the general interest of
the community. Once electricity is disconnected and the equipment dismantled, it is
unjust to compel the Board to give electricity connection to the very same premises at
the instance of a third party which will not be in public interest especially when
electricity is considered as a public property. Further petitioner has also not
challenged the validity of Regulations 15(d) and 15(e) in this writ petition.” (emphasis
supplied)
148. Two cases — K.C. Ninan v. KSEB69 and KJ Dennis v. KSEB,70 arise from the state of Kerala. In
both these cases, the Kerala High Court upheld the validity of Clause 15(e) and directed that to avail
a fresh electricity connection for 2005 (3) KLT 856 CA 2109-2110/2004 CA 2108/2004 PART G
premises where arrears are due, the auction purchasers would have to pay outstanding dues of the
previous consumer in compliance with the said condition. Item 101.9: KJ Dennis v. Kerala State
Electricity Board; Civil Appeal 2108 of
149. The KSEB disconnected the electricity connection of Pearlite Wire Products Ltd in 1992 on
account of unpaid electricity charges. Meanwhile, the Kerala High Court ordered the winding up of
the company under the Sick Industrial Companies (Special Provision) Act 1985,71 as the original
owner failed to pay its dues to Syndicate Bank and Kerala Financial Corporation. On 20 April 1997,
KSEB addressed a letter to the Official Liquidator, demanding payment of Rs 66 lakhs, being arrears
of electricity charges and penal interest. On 27 January 1999, the offer of the appellant to purchase
the properties of Pearlite Wire Products Ltd was accepted and was confirmed by the Kerala High
Court on 4 March 1999. The terms of sale, as settled by the High Court, provided that:
“7. General terms and conditions:-
***
(c) The assets are sold on “As Where is and Whatever there Is” condition.
(d) The assets are sold on the assumption that the tendered have inspected the assets,
know what they are tendering for, whether they have inspected or not and the
principle of ‘Caveat Emptor’ will apply.”

150. The appellant sought permission of the KSEB for wiring for an electricity connection in the
property by a letter dated 4 June 1999. Wiring permission was rejected by KSEB due to the
outstanding dues of the erstwhile owner, and it was “SICA” PART G stated that a new connection
would be provided if the appellant was ready to remit the amount due from the previous consumer.
151. In the interregnum, KSEB filed a claim petition before the Company Court in a company
petition72 claiming a sum of Rs 86,54,711 from Pearlite Wire Products Ltd, which was in
liquidation. The claim petition was admitted for Rs 63 lakhs. The appellant filed a company
application73 seeking a direction to the KSEB to not insist on payment of arrears of electricity
charges by the auction purchaser, which were due from the company in liquidation. On 18
September 2000, the Single Judge rejected the application filed by the appellant, holding that KSEB
can insist on the arrears being cleared before the connection is given. Aggrieved by the order, the
appellant challenged the validity of Clause 15(e) before the High Court on the ground that it is
violative of Article 14 of the Constitution. On 18 July 2001, the Division Bench rejected the
challenge. Finally, on 14 September 2001, the impugned order was passed in which the Review
Petition against the order of the Division Bench was dismissed.
152. By its judgement dated 18 July 2001, the Kerala High Court upheld the validity of Clause 15(e)
and held that the KSEB is not bound to give a reconnection or a new connection to the premises
where there are arrears on any account due to the Board, unless the arrears including penalty, are
cleared in advance. It observed that Section 79(j) read with Section 49 of the 1948 Act gave
considerable latitude to the Board to make regulations governing the supply of electricity, and the
Board could effect supply of electricity upon such terms and Company Petition 15 of 1994 Company
Application 349 of 1999 in Company Petition 15 of 1994 PART G conditions as it thinks fit, that is, in
accordance with Clause 15(e). The Court further noted that even when all formalities have been
satisfied by a prospective consumer in accordance with Clause VI of the Schedule to the 1910 Act,
the Board retains the power to lay down appropriate regulations to safeguard electricity, which is
public property and take actions in the best interest of the Board. The Court placed reliance on the
judgement of the Kerala High Court in A Ramachandran v. KSEB74 in reaching its decision.
153. In the impugned judgement dated 14 September 2001 in the Review Petition, the Court further
clarified that Clause 15(e) can also be invoked in winding up proceedings as the manner in which the
new person became owner, allottee or occupier of the property is immaterial. Finally, the High Court
clarified that the mere fact that the Electricity Board was trying to recover the due amount as a
secured creditor before the winding up proceedings as against the previous owner, would be of no
consequence on the applicability of Clause 15(e).
154. Notice was issued by this Court on 25 January 2002. By an order dated 28 February 2007, this
Court directed the parties to negotiate a settlement and arrive at a formula to recover the amount
agreeable to both parties. This Court observed:
“Balancing the equities as they arise in the present case would be a delicate task, and
whichever way we decide this case the losing party may feel that justice has been
denied to it. At the same time, we cannot lose sight of the fact that the appellants

63
have made huge investments as claimed by them, and only the interest component on
such investment may create a huge liability as against the appellant. On the other
2000 SCC OnLine Ker 75 PART G hand, if the industry starts functioning, perhaps
the Electricity Board will also stand to gain. We have no doubt that instead of
litigating, if the parties could have settled the dispute, both would have benefited to a
great extent.” However, no settlement could be reached.
155. We are of the view that the Kerala High Court was correct in upholding the validity of Clause
15(e). Clause 15 of the Conditions of Supply of the Electrical Energy, which is statutory in character,
unequivocally provides that the Board is not obligated to give reconnection or a new connection in
the premises where there are any arrears of electricity charges from a previous consumer, unless the
arrears including penalty are cleared by the new owner/ occupier/ allottee. Furthermore, in the
present case the terms of auction sale provided that the assets were sold on “as is where is and
whatever there is'' basis. In the light of the clear facts, the respondent would be well within its right
to demand the electricity arrears due, from the appellant-purchaser. Since KSEB’s claim petition
was admitted for Rs 63,94,298 the amount remitted, if any, by the appellant to whom connection
has been effected would be adjusted in accordance with Clause 15(e).
156. We hold that the decision of the High Court does not call for interference. The appeal is
therefore dismissed.
Item 101: K.C. Ninan v. Kerala State Electricity Board; Civil Appeal No. 2109-2110 of 2004
157. The appellant purchased the property of United Industries Cochin Ltd in a court auction on 31
October 1989. The electricity connection of the premises was PART G earlier disconnected in 1980
and the electric supply line was dismantled in 1985 on account of non-payment of electricity
charges. On 1 December 1989, the appellant allegedly applied to KSEB for an electric connection to
the purchased premises. Subsequently, on 1 January 1990, Clause 15 of the Conditions of Supply of
electrical energy was effectuated. On 12 June 1990, the KSEB sent a communication to the
appellant, refusing to grant an electric connection unless the appellant paid the arrears of electricity
of the premises. As a consequence, the appellant filed a writ petition seeking a permanent electrical
connection and challenging Clause 15(e) of the Conditions of Supply.
158. The High Court in the judgement dated 13 February 2003 relied on KJ Dennis (supra) and A
Ramachandran (supra), and rejected the prayer of the auction purchaser to get an electricity
connection without paying the dues of the previous owner to the KSEB. The appellant filed a review
petition against the judgement dated 13 February 2003. It was the appellant’s contention that the
decisions in Ramachandran (supra) and KJ Dennis (supra) are inapplicable to the facts of the case.
The appellant submitted that the “judgement under review was delivered without taking note of the
fact that condition 15(e) was incorporated in the Conditions of Supply of Electrical Energy only with
effect from 1.1.1990 while the petitioner purchased the property on 31.10.1989 in a Court auction
and the application for electric connection was made on 1.12.1989.” The review petition filed by the
appellant was dismissed on the ground that the High Court’s decision in Ramachandran (supra)
took into consideration the ratio in Isha Marbles (supra) and thereafter upheld the action taken by

the respondent- Board.
PART G
159. This Court issued notice on 7 January 2004, and granted leave on 2 April 2004. Recovery
proceedings were stayed on 5 May 2006.
160. The appellant has submitted in the course of the written submissions that the impugned
regulation would apply prospectively as subordinate legislation made by a delegate cannot have
retrospective effect unless rule making power in the concerned statute expressly or by necessary
implication confers power in this behalf.75 It was further stated that the appellant had applied for
electricity connection on 1 December 1989, before the Conditions of Supply came into force. It has
been urged that in the absence of any existing statutory regulations, the appellant cannot be called
upon to clear the past arrears incurred by the erstwhile consumer as a condition precedent to
electricity supply.
161. The relevant date to determine the applicability of the Conditions of Supply is the date on which
the auction purchaser applies for a fresh connection of electricity for the premises, and not the date
of purchase of the undertaking. The issue before this Court is whether there was any statutory
provision in operation governing the issue of recovery of the defaulted amount as on the date when
the appellant applied for a new electric connection.
162. The respondent in their counter affidavit has raised a dispute on the factum of the date of
application for a fresh connection of electricity. The respondent submits that the court sale was held
on 31 October 1989, which was confirmed on 22 January 1990 and the sale certificate was signed on
6 April 1990. It is argued that in these circumstances, it is unlikely that the appellant would have
Reliance placed on State of Madhya Pradesh v. Tikamdas, (1975) 2 SCC 100 PART G received
possession of the premises or would have applied for an electric connection on 1 December 1989, as
alleged by the appellant.
163. However, neither party has submitted any material on record to prove the date of the
application for the grant of a power connection. In view of the material factual dispute and
insufficient evidence on record, we remand the matter to the High Court to determine whether
Condition 15 of Conditions of Supply of Electrical Energy would apply to the appellant’s case,
bearing in mind the principles which have been laid down in this judgment. II. Maharashtra
164. In the state of Maharashtra, the terms and conditions under which the MSEB supplied
electrical energy were provided in the MSEB Conditions of Supply. The MSEB Conditions of Supply
were made effective from 1 January 1976. The MSEB Conditions of Supply laid down a detailed
procedure in respect of the application for supply of electrical energy, payment of bills, procedure to
be adopted in case of prejudicial use of electrical energy and the terms on which the supply of
electrical energy is released to a consumer. Condition 23 of MSEB Conditions of Supply provides for
assignment and transfer of agreement.

165. In light of the New Industrial Development Policy 1993, aimed at reviving sick industries, the
MSEB issued Circular 518 dated 18 June 1993, titled “Power Supply to closed and Sick Industrial
Unit”. The aim of Circular 518 was to encourage prospective entrepreneurs to take over sick
industrial units under Section 29 of the State Financial Corporation Act 1957. The Circular
presented prospective owners who purchased sick/ closed industrial units in auction with PART G
two options — either pay arrears including minimum charges to get electricity supply reconnected,
or apply for a fresh connection after completing necessary formalities, without being liable for
outstanding arrears of the previous owner. The circular further provided that Condition 23(b) of the
MSEB Conditions of Supply would not apply to prospective consumers with effect from 1 April 1993.
166. The circular was withdrawn by the Circular 607 dated 19 December 1998, whereby it was
mandated that reconnection or fresh connection would be released only after the arrears of the
Electricity Board are cleared. The circular purported to emanate from Condition 23(b) of the
Conditions of Supply, as framed by the MSEB. The circular was made operative with immediate and
prospective effect.
167. In light of the impugned judgments of the Bombay High Court, which are in appeal before us,
MSEB by its Circular 684 dated 25 September 2003 allowed auction purchasers of closed/ sick
industrial units to exercise either of the options as prescribed by Circular 518 dated 18 June 1993.
However, an undertaking was required by the incoming consumers to unconditionally agree to pay
the arrears of previous owners in case the Supreme Court decided in favour of MSEB.
168. After the enactment of the 2003 Act, the Maharashtra Electricity Supply Code, 2005 was
framed under Section 50 of the 2003 Act. The regulations came into effect from 20 January 2005,
and apply prospectively. Regulation 10.5 of the Maharashtra Electricity Supply Code provides that
dues owed to the distribution licensee are charge on the property and as a statutory effect, the
liability for the PART G payment of electricity dues is passed on to the new owner/ occupier of the
premises, albeit to a certain time restriction. Regulation 10.5 provides as follows:
“10.5: Any charge for electricity or any sum other than a charge for electricity due to
the Distribution Licensee which remains unpaid by a deceased consumer or the
erstwhile owner / occupier of any premises, as a case may be, shall be a charge on the
premises transmitted to the legal representatives / successors-in-law or transferred
to the new owner / occupier of the premises, as the case may be, and the same shall
be recoverable by the Distribution Licensee as due from such legal representatives or
successors-in-law or new owner / occupier of the premises, as the case may be.
Provided that, except in the case of transfer of connection to a legal heir, the
liabilities transferred under this Regulation 10.5 shall be restricted to a maximum
period of six months of the unpaid charges for electricity supplied to such premises”
169. Presently, the Maharashtra Electricity Regulatory Commission (Electricity Supply Code and
other Standards of Performance of Distribution Licensees including Power Quality) Regulations
202176 have been enacted repealing the Maharashtra Electricity Supply Code 2005. Clause 12.5 of
K.C. Ninan vs Kerala State Electricity Board & ... on 19 May, 2023
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/160269658/
66
the 2021 Regulations reiterates that any unpaid charges for electricity shall be a charge on the
premises.
170. From the state of Maharashtra, there are six judgments of the Bombay High Court which are in
appeal before us.
169. Mr. Ajit Bhasme, learned senior counsel appearing on behalf of the appellant-Board urged the
following common legal submissions:
“2021 Regulations” PART G a. MSEB Conditions of Supply, as then prevalent under the 1910 Act
and the 1948 Act, are statutory in character, as held by this Court in Hyderabad Vanaspati (supra).
The Conditions of Supply are in addition to and not in lieu of other modes of recovery; b. MSEB
Conditions of Supply are a part of the standard agreement entered into between the consumer and
the Electricity Company. Clause 14 of the standard agreement between the Electricity Board and the
consumer incorporates the Conditions of Supply as a part of the agreement;
c. The reliance placed by the Bombay High Court on the judgement in Isha Marbles (supra) cannot
be sustained since the case of Isha Marbles (supra) is distinguishable on facts;
d. The General Auction Conditions of Sale of SICOM in Clause 2 stipulate that the sale is on “as is
where is and what is” basis. Auction purchasers were put on notice of their liability for the past
electricity arrears due to the inclusion of the standard auction proclamation (Clause 6) while
inviting bids;
e. Regulation 10.5 of Maharashtra Electricity Supply Code 2005 explicitly states that any unpaid
electricity dues shall be a charge on the premises transferred; and f. All six cases pertain to the
period prior to 2005 i.e., before the enactment of the Maharashtra Electricity Supply Code 2005.
The 1976 PART G MSEB Conditions of Supply would continue to operate till the enactment of the
Maharashtra Electricity Supply Code in 2005.
171. In Maharashtra, the right of the Electric Utilities to demand outstanding dues is traceable to
provisions across different time periods:
a. Up to enactment of the 2003 Act on 10 June 2003: The governing laws are the
1910 Act and the 1948 Act. The MSEB Conditions of Supply were framed under
Section 49 of the 1948 Act. The MSEB Conditions of Supply which were made
effective from 1 January 1976 would apply;
b. From 10 June 2003 to 20 January 2005: The provisions of the 2003 Act were
brought into force with effect from 10 June 2003. The 1910 Act and 1948 stood
repealed after the enactment of the 2003 Act. The Maharashtra Electricity Supply
Code 2005 came into force from 20 January 2005. In the interregnum, the MSEB
Conditions of Supply would continue to apply, so far as they are not inconsistent with
the provisions of the 2003 Act. This is due to the following reasons:
K.C. Ninan vs Kerala State Electricity Board & ... on 19 May, 2023
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/160269658/
67
i. By virtue of Section 185(2)(a) of the 2003 Act, notwithstanding such repeal anything done or any
action taken or purported to have been done or taken including any rule, notification, inspection,
order or notice made etc. under the repealed law shall, in so far as it is not inconsistent with the
provisions of this Act, be deemed to have been done or taken under the corresponding provisions of
this Act. Section 185(2)(5) further PART G provides that Section 6 of the General Clauses Act 1897
would be applicable in relation to matters prescribed in Section 185(2) with regard to the effect of
repeals;
ii. Regulation 19(1) of the Electricity Supply Code 2005, provides that any terms and conditions of
supply which are inconsistent with the provisions of the Maharashtra Electricity Supply Code 2005
shall be deemed to be invalid from the date on which these regulations come into force; and c. From
20 January 2005 till the enactment of the 2021 Regulations: The Maharashtra Electricity Supply
Code 2005, which came into force from 20 January 2005, would apply. To determine whether the
Maharashtra Electricity Supply Code 2005 would govern the facts of a particular case, the relevant
date would be when the auction purchaser had requested the Electricity Board to supply electricity.
172. In the six cases originating from Maharashtra, the respondents were successful auction
purchasers who purchased the premises in court auction sales. The appellant-Board relied on
Condition 23 of the MSEB Conditions of Supply to impose a precondition of clearing electricity
arrears of the erstwhile consumer, before a new electricity connection could be provided. The High
Court in all the cases directed the appellant-Board to provide reconnection or fresh connection to
the respondents, without insisting on payment of arrears.
173. These impugned judgments raise a common question on the applicability and the scope of
Condition 23. This Court would first deal with the overall PART G argument on the applicability of
Condition 23 of the MSEB Conditions of Supply, and its interpretation, before delving into the
specific factual matrix of the cases.
174. In Maharashtra State Electricity Board v. Super & Stainless Hi Alloys Ltd.,77 the Bombay High
Court relied on the decision of this Court in Isha Marbles (supra) to quash the impugned circular
dated 19 December 1998 for lack of jurisdiction as it was held to be beyond the powers of the
Electricity Board under Section 24 of the 1910 Act. The High Court concluded that the contract of
supply was only between the Electricity Board and the previous consumer, and since the subsequent
purchaser was a third party, it cannot be made liable for the past liabilities of the erstwhile
consumer.
175. In Supdt. Engg. Maharashtra State Electricity Board v. M/s Umang Enterprises,78 the High
Court placed reliance on the decisions of this Court in Isha Marbles (supra) and Gujarat Inns
(supra) to reject the argument of the appellant-Board. The Bombay High Court disposed of the writ
petition with a direction to the appellant to grant an electricity connection to the premises, without
insisting on clearance of past dues of the previous consumer. It is important to note that the High
Court in its reasoning did not refer to the MSEB Conditions of Supply and the import of Condition
23 on the liability of the auction purchasers.
K.C. Ninan vs Kerala State Electricity Board & ... on 19 May, 2023
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/160269658/
68
176. In Maharashtra State Electricity Board v. Ecto Spinners,79 and Maharashtra State Electricity
Distribution Co. Ltd. v. M/s Zia Iron Store,80 the Civil Appeal 5312-5313 of 2005 Civil Appeal No.
5314 of 2005 Civil Appeal No. 6587 of 2005 SLP(Civil) No. 6068 of 2006 PART G High Court
considered the purport of Condition 23 of the MSEB Conditions of Supply. It concluded that
Condition 23 was not applicable to involuntary transfers, such as by operation of law or in
pursuance of the decree of a competent court. Accordingly, it held that the respondent-purchasers
could not be made liable for the dues of the erstwhile owners as a prerequisite to obtain a new
electricity connection.
177. The Bombay High Court in the impugned judgement dated 20 July 2005 in Ecto Spinners was
aided by the following reasons to arrive at this conclusion:
a. Condition 23(b) does not refer to an involuntary transfer though it does refer to a
voluntary transfer or a transfer on account of the death of the owner. The word
“successor” in the expression “any person claiming to be heir, legal representative,
transferee, assignee or successor of the defaulting consumer” would have to be
understood by applying the principle of ejusdem generis. Accordingly, the words
preceding the word “successor” clearly disclose a reference to a person who acquires
the right to the property on account of either voluntary transfer or on account of
death of the owner; and b. Transfer of a property purchased in a public auction is an
involuntary transfer by the owner. Hence, Condition 23 does not impose any liability
on a transferee occupying the premises of the erstwhile consumer on account of
having acquired right by public auction or any other mode of non-voluntary transfer.
PART G
178. The Electricity Board can demand arrears due by an erstwhile defaulting consumer in regard to
supply of electricity to premises from the purchaser of a property seeking reconnection or fresh
connection of electricity when either of two conditions are met:
a. An express provision exists in law providing that electricity arrears constitute a charge over the
property. For the statutory charge to be enforced against the property in the hands of a person to
whom such property has been transferred for consideration, the transferee must have notice, either
actual or constructive, of the charge; and b. The statutory regulations or terms and conditions of
supply which are statutory in character, authorise the supplier of electricity to make such a demand.
179. In general law, electricity arrears do not constitute a charge over the property. Under the
provisions of the 1910 Act read with the1948 Act, electricity arrears do not create a charge over the
property. In the cases before us governed by the 1910 Act read with 1948 Act, no charge was created
on the property in favour of the Electricity Board for the payment of electricity dues. The arrears of
electricity dues were not levied against the premises, but were levied against the erstwhile
consumer.

69
180. We are of the opinion that the Bombay High Court’s interpretation of the ratio in Isha Marbles
(supra) in Super & Stainless Hi Alloys Ltd and M/s Umang Enterprises is incorrect due to the reason
that the High Court failed to enquire into whether any statutory regulation or statutory terms and
conditions of PART G supply existed which pertained to the liability of a third person who acquires
the property of the erstwhile consumer.
181. In the cases pertaining to Maharashtra, MSEB or its successor the Maharashtra State Electricity
Distribution Co. Ltd. placed specific reliance on Condition 23 of the statutory Conditions of Supply.
Condition 23 is the only clause in the statutory provisions which pertains to the liability of a person
who acquires the property of the erstwhile consumer in circumstances specified thereunder. Circular
607 dated 19 December 1998 is stated to emanate from Condition 23(b) of the Conditions of Supply.
The Bihar State Electricity Board in Isha Marbles (supra) did not have a specific condition having a
similar effect as Condition 23.
182. In Hyderabad Vanaspathi (supra) this Court held that the Conditions of Supply in the State of
Andhra Pradesh, notified in exercise of the powers conferred by Section 49 of the 1948 Act, are
statutory in character. The Court noted that no regulation has been made under Section 79(j) of the
1948 Act.
183. In the present case, the appellant-Board in exercise of its powers under Section 49 of the
Electricity Supply Act formulated the MSEB Conditions of Supply. Accordingly, the MSEB
Conditions of Supply are statutory in nature.
184. When a provision having a statutory force and effect is relied upon by the Electric Utilities to
impose the liability of clearing the outstanding dues of the erstwhile consumer on a third party, it is
for the courts to determine whether the said statutory provision is applicable to the facts of the case
before it. In Special Officer, Commerce, North Eastern Electricity Supply Company of Orissa v.
PART G Raghunath Paper Mills Private Limited,81 this Court observed that Regulation 13(10)(b) of
the Orissa Electricity Regulatory Commission Distribution (Conditions of Supply), Code, 2004 was
inapplicable to the facts of the case as the auction purchaser had requested for a fresh connection,
whereas in terms of the concerned regulation, previous dues had to be cleared only with respect to a
reconnection or a transfer of service connection from the name of the erstwhile consumer.
185. The submission of the appellant on the applicability of Condition 23 rests on the meaning and
scope of Condition 23 in relation to the liability of a person who becomes the new owner or occupier
of the premises of the erstwhile consumer, to which electricity was being supplied. Condition 23 is
extracted below:
“Clause 23: Assignment or Transfer of Agreement
a) The consumer shall not without previous consent in writing of the Board, assign,
transfer or part with the benefit of his Agreement with the Board nor shall the
consumer in any manner part with or create any partial or separate interest
thereunder.
K.C. Ninan vs Kerala State Electricity Board & ... on 19 May, 2023
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/160269658/
70
b) A consumer who commits breach of condition 23(a) above and neglects to pay to
the Board any charges for energy or to deposit with the Board amount of security
deposit or compensation and the supply of such consumer is disconnected under
Section 24 of the Indian Electricity Act, 1910 or under condition no.
31(a) of these conditions dies, or transfers, assigns or otherwise dispenses of the undertaking or the
premises to which energy was being supplied to the consumer, any person claiming to be heir, legal
representative, transferee, assignee or successor of the defaulting consumer with or without
consideration in any manner shall be deemed to be liable to pay the arrears of electricity charges,
security deposit or compensation due payable by the consumer and it shall be lawful for the Board to
refuse to supply or reconnect the supply or to give a new (2012) 13 SCC 479 PART G connection to
such person claiming to be the heir, legal representative, transferee, assignee or successor of the
defaulting consumer of such premises, unless the amount of such charges due and / or the
compensation demanded from the defaulting consumer, is as the case may be duly paid to or
deposited with the Board.” (emphasis supplied)
186. In terms of Condition 23(a), a consumer is not entitled to transfer the benefit under their
agreement with the Electricity Board without the previous consent of the Board. In terms of
Condition 23(b), if the consumer commits breach of Condition 23(a) and neglects to pay the Board
any charges for energy and consequently, the electricity supply of such consumer is disconnected,
then the third party upon whom such a transfer was effected is liable to pay arrears of electricity
which the defaulting consumer has not paid. Liability of a third party to pay dues of the erstwhile
consumer is attached when the conditions specified in Condition 23(a) and Condition 23(b) are
satisfied.
187. The rule of “ejusdem generis” is a principle of construction. The rule is that when general words
follow particular and specific words of the same nature, the general words must be confined to the
things of the same kind as those specified. It applies when the following ingredients are present: (i)
the statute contains an enumeration of specific words; (ii) the subjects of enumeration constitute a
class or category; (iii) that category is not exhausted by the enumeration; (iv) a general term follows
the enumeration; and (v) there is no indication of a different legislative intent.82 Amar Chandra v.
Collector of Excise, Tripura, (1972) 2 SCC 442; Grasim Industries Ltd. v. Collector of Customs,
(2002) 4 SCC 297 PART G
188. For the application of the ejusdem generis rule, it is essential that enumerated things before the
general words must constitute a distinct category or a genus or a family which admits of a number of
members.83 In Adoni Cotton Mills Ltd. v. Andhra Pradesh State Electricity Board,84 this Court had
to interpret Section 49(3) of the 1948 Act, which empowered the Electricity Board to fix different
tariffs for the supply of electricity to any person having regard to the geographical position of any
area, the nature of supply and purpose for which the supply is required and any other relevant
factors. This Court refused to limit the generality of “other relevant factors” since there was no genus
of the enumerated factors. Geographical position of the area and the nature and purpose of the
supply were held not to be related to any common genus.
K.C. Ninan vs Kerala State Electricity Board & ... on 19 May, 2023
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/160269658/
71
189. In the impugned judgment Ecto Spinners, the Bombay High Court observed that the word
“successor”, occurs in the collocation of other words “heir”, “legal representative”, “transferee” and
“assignee”, and its meaning must take colour from the preceding words in association with which it
is used. It held that the word “successor” has to be understood to refer to an owner acquiring the
right by way of voluntary transfer or on account of the right of inheritance.
190. We are unable to accept the reasoning of the High Court. The dictionary meaning of some
words and expressions, which have a bearing on this case, has been set out in Black’s law Dictionary
as follows:
Lokmat Newspapers (P) Ltd. v. Shankarprasad, (1999) 6 SCC 275; Jaiprakash Associates Ltd. v.
Tehri Hydro Development Corpn. (India) Ltd., (2019) 17 SCC 786 (1976) 4 SCC 68 PART G “Heir: A
person who, under the laws of intestacy, is entitled to receive an intestate decedent’s property85
Legal representative: A legal heir; or an executor, administrator or other legal representative86
Transferee: One to whom a property interest is conveyed87 Assignee: One to whom property rights
are transferred by another”88
191. It is clear from the plain meaning of the words that the expressions “heir”, “legal
representative”, “transferee” and “assignee” do not fall into one single distinct category. According
to the reasoning in the impugned judgment, Condition 23 itself consists of more than one genus or
category of transfer — acquiring the right to a property on account of voluntary transfer, or on
account of death of the owner. The word “successor”, which was interpreted by the High Court in a
restricted manner, is itself of wide amplitude and will have to be given a plain meaning. The
expression “successor” has been defined in Black’s Law Dictionary as “a person who succeeds to the
office, rights, responsibilities, or place of another; one who replaces or follows a predecessor.” 89
The category of a “universal successor” is further understood to mean “someone who succeeds to all
the rights and powers of a former owner, as with an intestate estate or an estate in bankruptcy”.90
192. The wide compass of the expression “any person claiming to be heir, legal representative,
transferee, assignee or successor of the defaulting consumer” 85 th Black’s Law Dictionary (WEST:
Thomson Reuters 9 edition), Pg 791 Black’s Law Dictionary (WEST: Thomson Reuters 9th edition),
Pg 1416 Black’s Law Dictionary (WEST: Thomson Reuters 9th edition), Pg 136 88 th Black’s Law
Dictionary (WEST: Thomson Reuters 9 edition), Pg 1636 Black’s Law Dictionary (WEST: Thomson
Reuters 9th edition), Pg 1569 Id PART G can be understood with regard to the former
corresponding phrase “dies, or transfers, assigns or otherwise dispenses of the undertaking or the
premises”.
193. In the case at hand, the use of the expression “otherwise dispenses of” in the phrase “a
consumer…dies, or transfers, assigns or otherwise dispenses of the undertaking or premises'', does
not bring into play the rule of ejusdem generis for the preceding words “dies”, “transfers”, “assigns”
do not belong to a single limited genus.
194. The word “transfer” itself is generally regarded to have a wide connotation, comprehending
within it both voluntary and involuntary transfers. In Mangalore Electric Supply Co. Ltd. v. The

Commissioner of Income Tax, West Bengal,91 a three-judge Bench of this Court held that a
compulsory acquisition of property can constitute a “transfer” within the meaning of Section 12B(1)
of the Indian Income Tax Act 1962. It rejected the argument that the word “transfer” must be
construed ejusdem generis with the preceding words “sale”, “exchange”, “relinquishment”. On the
wide amplitude of the word ‘transfer’, this Court observed:
“8. We find it impossible to accept this submission. In the first place if it was
intended that voluntary transfers alone should fall within the meaning of the section,
it was unnecessary for the legislature to use the expression “transfer”, an expression
acknowledged in law as having a wide connotation and amplitude. Earl Jowitt, in
“The Dictionary of English Law” says:
“In the law of property, a transfer is where a right passes from one person to another,
either (1) by virtue of an act done by the transferor with that intention, as in the case
of a conveyance or assignment by way (1978) 3 SCC 248 PART G of sale or gift, etc; or
(2) by operation of law, as in the case of forfeiture, bankruptcy, descent, or intestacy.”
Roland Burrows on “Words and Phrases”, Volume V, contains a statement under the
caption “Transfer on Sale” at p. 331 that even a transfer of land under compulsory
powers is a transfer “on sale”. It is unnecessary for us to consider the question
whether a compulsory acquisition of property is a “sale” within the meaning of
Section 12-B(1) and indeed, it is needless for the present purpose to go that far. We
are concerned with the narrower question whether a compulsory acquisition of
property can amount to a “transfer” within the meaning of Section 12-B(1) and upon
that question it is important to bear in mind that the word “transfer” is
comprehensive and is regarded generally as comprehending within its scope transfers
both of the voluntary and involuntary kinds. Without more, therefore, there is no
reason for limiting the operation of the word “transfer” to voluntary acts of transfer
so as to exclude compulsory acquisitions of property.” (emphasis supplied)
195. The rule of ejusdem generis cannot be applied when there is no distinct category
or a genus. In the absence of a genus, the words ‘transfer’ or ‘otherwise dispenses of’,
which are wide in their meaning, cannot be restricted to only mean voluntary
transfers by the application of the ejusdem generis principle.
196. The rule of ejusdem generis is not an inviolable rule of law.92 Where the context and mischief
of the statutory enactment do not require a restricted meaning to be attached to words of general
import, the court has to give the words their plain and ordinary meaning.93 Condition 23 of the
MSEB Conditions of Supply is a mode of recovery of electricity arrears of the erstwhile consumer,
which could be recovered even from a successor. The MSEB, in our opinion, Valparaiso Kottarathil
Kochuni v. States of Madras & Kerala, (1960) 3 SCR 887 BHEL v. Globe Hi-Fabs Ltd., (2015) 5 SCC
718 PART G intended to cover all possible cases of transfer of the undertaking or premises of the
erstwhile consumer, be it voluntary, on account of death of the consumer, or by operation of law.
Circular 518 dated 18 June 1993 and Circular 607 dated 19 December 1998 issued by the MSEB
emanated from Condition 23 of the MSEB Conditions of Supply. They contained directions vis-à-vis
K.C. Ninan vs Kerala State Electricity Board & ... on 19 May, 2023

73
power supplied to those property owners who purchased sick and closed industrial units. The
context and the purpose of the statutory terms and conditions of supply demand that a broader
construction should be adopted, and there is no room for the application of the rule of ejusdem
generis.
197. On our interpretation of Condition 23 of the MSEB Conditions of Supply with particular
reference to subclause (b) thereof, we are of the view that the said sub-clause is applicable to
involuntary transfers, such as court auctions.
198. Applying the above considerations to the appeals our conclusions are as follows:
Item 101.1: Maharashtra State Electricity Board v. Super & Stainless Hi Alloys Ltd; Civil Appeal
5312-5313 of 2005
199. The first respondent purchased a sick industrial unit in auction from the SICOM under Section
29 of the State Financial Corporations Act. It filed a writ petition challenging the actions of the
appellant-Board in denying it a new electricity connection. A subsequent writ petition was filed by
SICOM challenging the vires of Circular 607 dated 19 December 1998. By a common judgment
dated 19 December 2002, the Bombay High Court disposed of the writ petitions and quashed the
impugned Circular 607 on the ground that MSEB lacked jurisdiction PART G as the circular was
beyond the powers of the Board under Section 24 of the 1910 Act. The High Court relied on Isha
Marbles (supra), to reach the conclusion that although Section 24 provides for payment of arrears
for reconnection after the supply is disconnected, it only refers to the consumer who failed to pay
the dues and does not concern itself with a new owner or occupier of the premises.
200. The appellant preferred the present Special Leave Petition. This Court issued notice on 6 May
2003 and leave was granted on 25 August 2005. By an order dated 24 August 2006, the question
whether electricity dues constitute a charge on the property so far as the transferor and the
transferee of the unit are concerned was referred to a larger bench.
201. In our considered view, the decision in Isha Marbles (supra) and Section 24 of the Electricity
Act 1910 are by themselves not an answer on whether the appellant-Board had a power to issue
Circular 607. In Srigdhaa Beverages (supra), this Court held that the electricity dues, where they are
statutory in character under the Electricity Act and as per the terms and conditions of supply,
cannot be waived in view of the provisions of the Act itself, more specifically Section 56 of the 2003
Act (pari materia with Section 24 of the 1910 Act), and cannot partake the character of purely
contractual dues. The power of the appellant-Board to impose a condition that the purchaser of an
undertaking will have the obligation to clear the arrears of electricity dues of the prior consumer is
sourced from Condition 23 of the MSEB Conditions of Supply framed under Section 49 of the 1948
Act.

202. It was the submission of the respondents that the impugned circular cannot affect the rights of
the auction purchasers who purchased sick/ closed industrial units under Section 29 of the State
Financial Corporation Act 1951 as the sale was “not voluntary”. As discussed above, Condition 23 is
of wide import, which covers sale of property made in court auctions. Furthermore, Section 29(2) of
the State Financial Corporation Act provides that a sale under Section 29 which resulted in transfer
of property shall vest in the successor all rights in the property transferred as if the transfer has been
made by the owner of the property. Accordingly, a sale made by the corporation is deemed to be a
sale made by the owner of the property, attracting Condition 23 of the MSEB Conditions of Supply.
203. It is necessary to reproduce some of the relevant clauses of the “General Auction Conditions of
Sale” of properties put on sale by SICOM. The clauses are extracted below:
“Clause 4: The purchaser may take inspection of the property to be sold. Even if the
purchaser does not take inspection, he shall be deemed to have inspected all the
assets put up for sale on “As is where is and what is basis” in regard to the condition
thereof, before making the offer for purchase of the same. It is hereby expressly
agreed and declared that notwithstanding the provisions of Section 55 of the Transfer
of Property Act or any other enactment for the time being in force in that behalf,
SICOM shall not be bound to disclose to the purchaser any defect, whether material
or otherwise in the property, whether or not SICOM may be or may not be aware of
such defect and whether or not the purchaser could not with ordinary care and
diligence discover such defects.
Clause 6: The purchaser shall make his own arrangement for getting required power connection,
water and other facilities and payment of arrears of rates and taxes of the said property and shall
meet all the costs of whatever nature to be incurred in that behalf. SICOM PART G shall not be liable
to pay any arrears if charges and costs/ expenses, if any, in respect of power, water or any other
facilities required. The purchaser shall make own inquiries about arrears of dues for supply of
power, water and other facilities, if any, and the same shall be borne and paid by the purchaser
alone.” (emphasis supplied)
204. The aforesaid terms and conditions of the auction as set out by SICOM indicate that the
property was being sold on “as is where is and what is basis”. The auction purchaser was at all times
on clear notice of the fact that the property was being sold on an “as is where is” basis and that
SICOM did not undertake any liability for the payment of dues. This clause was further subject to
another provision in Clause 6, where the purchaser was liable to make their own inquiries about
arrears of dues for supply of power, water and other facilities and the auction purchaser was made
liable to pay such arrears. This makes it clear that apart from the MSEB Conditions of Supply, which
have statutory effect, the purchaser who purchased property in auctions conducted under Section 29
of the State Financial Corporations Act also had knowledge of his liability for the past arrears of
electricity of the premises when he bid in the auction. By virtue of the stipulations in the sale deed,
as far as the first respondent is concerned, it was liable to discharge the electricity dues payable to
the Electricity Board by the erstwhile consumer.

205. In light of what we have stated above, we set aside the judgement of the Division Bench and
allow the appeal.
PART G Item 101.10: Supdt. Engg. Maharashtra State Electricity Board v. M/s Umang Enterprises;
Civil Appeal No. 5314 of 2005
206. The first respondent was a successful auction purchaser of the property of M/s Creekay Yarn
Industries Ltd, which was put to sale in consequence of an arbitral award. The
respondent-purchaser took out a Judges Order94 in a civil suit before the Bombay High Court,
seeking a clarification that it was not liable for past dues and liabilities of any kind in respect of the
property purchased through the auction sale. The Bombay High Court by its order dated 29 January
2003 declared that the respondent-purchaser was not liable to pay any arrears payable by the
erstwhile owner. The appellant alleges that this order was passed ex- parte. The order of the Bombay
High Court in Judges Order dated 29 January 2003 has not been placed on record before this Court.
207. The respondent-purchaser requested the appellant for a new electricity connection, which was
denied on 6 June 2003 on the ground that the respondent was not eligible for a new connection
unless the dues of the erstwhile consumer were discharged in terms of Condition 23 of the MSEB
Conditions of Supply. The respondent filed a writ petition, with an interim prayer seeking a
direction to grant a new electric connection. The main prayer in the writ petition sought a
declaration that the demand made by the Electricity Board to pay arrears was unfounded in law. The
Bombay High Court by its impugned judgment dated 24 September 2004 disposed of the writ
petition with a direction to the appellant to grant an electricity connection to the premises within
one month, without insisting on clearance of past dues of the previous consumer. The High Court
placed Judges Order No. 10 of 2003 in Civil Suit no. 2978 of 1991 PART G reliance on the decisions
of this Court in Isha Marbles (supra) and Gujarat Inns (supra).
208. The appellant preferred the present Special Leave petition. This Court issued notice on 6
January 2005.
209. As already stated before, this Court in both Isha Marbles (supra) and Gujarat Inns (supra) did
not hold the auction purchaser liable to clear the electricity arrears incurred by the previous owners
because there was no specific statutory provision in that regard, or any clause dealing with the issue
of electricity dues. In the present case, the MSEB placed specific reliance on Condition 23 of MSEB
Conditions of Supply to hold the auction purchasers liable. The MSEB Conditions of Supply were
incorporated in the individual contracts entered between the Electricity Board and the consumers.
Clause 14 in the standard agreements entered between the MSEB and consumers provides that the
Conditions of Supply, as amended from time to time, shall be deemed to be part of the agreement.
The erstwhile consumers were aware of the statutory MSEB Conditions of Supply. The relevant
clause is extracted below:
“Clause 14(a): Condition and Miscellaneous Charges for supply of electrical energy of
the Maharashtra State Electricity Board for the time being in force and as amended
by supplier from time to time shall be deemed to be part of the Agreement and shall
K.C. Ninan vs Kerala State Electricity Board & ... on 19 May, 2023

76
govern the parties hereto in so far as applicable. A copy of the current Conditions and
Miscellaneous Charges for supply is set out in the second schedule hereto.” PART G
210. We are of the considered view that the impugned order cannot be sustained and is accordingly
set aside.
Item 101.11: Maharashtra State Electricity Board v. Ecto Spinners; Civil Appeal No. 6587 of 2005
211. In 1999, the unit of M/s Prabhavati Spinning Mill, a co-operative spinning mill, was closed
down. The electricity supplied to M/s Prabhavati Spinning Mill had earlier been disconnected by the
appellant in default of payment of consumption charges. In 2004, the first respondent purchased
M/s Prabhavati Spinning Mill, which was liquidated by the authorities under the Maharashtra Co-
operative Societies Act 1960. The agreement of sale was executed in favour of the first respondent on
26 July 2004 and since then, the first respondent had the possession of the property. The final deed
of assignment was yet to be executed. The first respondent incurred an expenditure of Rs 4 crores to
overhaul the plant and machinery at the premises, and thereafter applied for a fresh electricity
connection as a High Tension Consumer for the premises. Meanwhile, the plots were transferred by
the Maharashtra Industrial Development Corporation to the first respondent on 4 February 2005.
The appellant, however, relied on the MSEB Conditions of Supply and the agreement entered with
the erstwhile consumer to decline granting electricity connection until the arrears of the erstwhile
consumer were cleared. The respondent filed a writ petition before the Aurangabad Bench of the
Bombay High Court, seeking a direction to the appellant to supply electricity to the respondent at its
premises.
PART G
212. By the impugned judgement dated 20 July 2005, the Bombay High Court allowed the writ
petition. The High Court held that the respondent could not be made liable for the dues of the
erstwhile owner as a prerequisite for obtaining a new electricity connection as there was neither any
statutory provision nor an agreement creating any charge over the property in relation to the
electricity arrears.
213. This Court granted leave on 24 October 2005. As discussed above, Condition 23 of MSEB
Conditions of Supply is a specific provision applicable to the case of the first respondent. In view of
the above, we allow this appeal, and set aside the judgment and order of the High Court.
Item 101.12: Maharashtra State Electricity Distribution Co. Ltd. v. M/s Zia Iron Store; SLP(Civil)
No. 6068 of 2006
214. The original consumer, M/s Sumit Re-Rolling Mills Pvt. Ltd, Nagpur, defaulted in the payment
of a loan taken from the Nagpur Nagrik Sahakari Bank. The bank filed a dispute before the
Co-operative court at Nagpur. The Judge, Cooperative court at Nagpur by an order dated 23
February 2005 granted permission to sell the hypothecated plant and machinery and mortgaged
land and building of M/s Sumit Re-Rolling Mills Pvt. Ltd. In the execution of the award, the
K.C. Ninan vs Kerala State Electricity Board & ... on 19 May, 2023
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/160269658/
77
property belonging to M/s Sumit Re-Rolling Mills Pvt. Ltd was purchased by the first respondent.
215. The authorised officer of the bank handed over the physical possession of the entire moveable
plant and machinery and immovable land and building, PART G mortgaged with the bank, to the
respondent on 21 March 2005 on “as is where is” and “as is what is” basis.
216. A deed of assignment and sale dated 17 February 2006 was entered between the Nagpur
Nagarik Sahakair Bank Ltd. and the respondent. Clause 2 of the indenture notes that the bank
would not take any liability for any dues like electricity dues and charges for fresh power connection.
The relevant clause is extracted below:
“The liabilities, if any and the liabilities which may arise in future in respect of the
dues of Local authorities and dues of Revenue Authority, MIDC Authority and Sales
Tax etc. and also for transfer of property in question, shall be for transfer of property
in question shall be payable by the purchaser. The property hereby assigned in on “as
is where is" and "as is what is" basis. The Bank does not undertake any liability or
responsibility to procure any permission/licence etc.in respect, of the property
offered for sale or for any dues like water/service charges of the MIDC, transfer fees,
electricity dues and charges for fresh power connection, Local Authority, or
Nazul/NIT dues, in respect of the said property and the same shall be solely and
exclusively borne and paid by the Purchaser.”
217. The first respondent applied for a fresh electricity connection for the premises. The
appellant-MSEDC refused the request of the first respondent by a letter dated 9 September 2005 on
the ground that the arrears of electricity charges of the earlier owner were pending, and the first
respondent was liable to clear them in light of Condition 23 of MSEB Conditions of Supply. The
Bombay High Court by its impugned judgment dated 12 December 2005 held that Condition 23 was
inapplicable and directed the appellant to grant a fresh connection to the first respondent, if
otherwise eligible. The High Court observed PART G that Condition 23 intended to apply to
voluntary acts of the original consumer by which he transfers the benefit of his agreement with the
Board.
218. The appellant filed a Special Leave Petition challenging the impugned judgement. The
appellant has argued that the concept of voluntariness is not a sine qua non for Condition 23 of the
MSEB Conditions of Supply. In the reply filed by the respondent, it has been urged that it is not a
necessary party to the present petition since it had sold the premises in dispute to Rajaram Steel
Industries Pvt Ltd by a deed of assignment dated 29 March 2006.
219. The High Court in the impugned judgment has based its decision on the MSEB Conditions of
Supply 1976. What is the effect of the respondent applying for a fresh electricity connection after the
enactment of the Maharashtra Electricity Supply Code on 20 January 2005 was not considered. The
relevant date to determine the applicability of the statutory provisions governing conditions of
supply of electricity is the date on which the auction purchaser applies for an electricity connection.
K.C. Ninan vs Kerala State Electricity Board & ... on 19 May, 2023

78
220. The application by the respondent in which it sought a fresh electricity connection has not been
placed on record. At the same time, from the deed of assignment and sale placed on record, it
emerges that the sale of the premises and possession was given after 20 January 2005. The
permission to sell was granted to the bank only on 23 February 2005. The physical possession of the
premises was given to the respondent only on 21 March 2005. A fresh connection of electricity
supply could not have been requested even before the sale was confirmed in favour of the
respondent. Accordingly, the relevant PART G statutory provision governing this case is the
Maharashtra Electricity Supply Code 2005.
221. In terms of Regulation 10.5, any charge for electricity or any sum other than a charge for
electricity due to the distribution licensee which remains unpaid by a deceased consumer or the
erstwhile occupier/owner of any premises shall be a charge on the premises transmitted to the legal
representatives / successors-in-law or transferred to the new owner / occupier of the premises, as
the case may be, and the same shall be recoverable by the Distribution Licensee as due from such
legal representatives or successors-in-law or new owner / occupier of the premises. However, the
proviso lays down that except in the case of a transfer of a connection to a legal heir, the liabilities
which are transferred under Regulation 10.5 are restricted to a maximum period of six months of
the unpaid charges for electricity supplied to the premises. Accordingly, the dues owed by M/s
Sumit Re-Rolling Mills Pvt.Ltd, Nagpur are charged on the property purchased by the first
respondent in a public auction.
222. The sale was conducted on “as is where is” basis and the respondent accordingly had adequate
notice of the charge. Hence, the distribution licensee is entitled to recover the unpaid dues from the
first respondent subject to the permitted period specified in the proviso to Regulation 10.5.
223. In view of the aforesaid legal position, which has emerged, we are of the view that the
impugned order of the High Court cannot be sustained. The appeal is allowed.
PART G Item 101.13: Maharashtra State Electricity Board v. M/s Jai Tirath Financiers Pvt. Ltd.;
SLP(Civil) No. 10732 of 2006
224. In 1999, liquidation proceedings were initiated against M/s Hariganga Alloys & Steel Ltd. By a
sale notice dated 2 May 2001, offers were invited from interested bidders for purchase of properties
of M/s Hariganga Alloys & Steel Ltd on “as is where is” and “as is what is” basis. The first
respondent successfully purchased the assets in the auction sale and took possession of the
purchased property in 2002.
225. On 17 June 2005, the respondent applied to the appellant for a new electricity connection to
the premises purchased in the auction. By a letter dated 22 June 2005, the appellant rejected the
application on the ground that arrears of electricity charges of Rs 83 lakhs of the erstwhile owner
were pending and a permanent electricity connection could not be released till full dues were paid.
The appellant permitted release for a temporary connection. The respondent filed Company
Application No. 106 of 2005 in Company Petition No.6 of 1999 in the matter of liquidation of M/s
Hariganga Alloys & Steel Ltd, seeking the release of a new electricity connection without clearance
K.C. Ninan vs Kerala State Electricity Board & ... on 19 May, 2023

79
of arrears.
226. The application of the respondent was allowed by the impugned order dated 10 February 2006,
passed by a Single Judge at the Nagpur Bench of the Bombay High Court. The High Court held that
the appellant could not deny electricity connection to the respondent on the ground of recovery of
arrears of the erstwhile owner of the plot. The High Court noted that the appellant was one PART G
of the secured creditors and directed it to make its claim before the Official Liquidator in accordance
with law.
227. The appellant preferred the present Special Leave petition. On 17 July 2006, this Court issued
notice and stayed the operation of the impugned order.
228. During the pendency of the appeal, the respondent had sold the property to M/s Ankush
Shikshan Santha and the new owner had submitted a proposal dated 9 August 2007 to the appellant
that it was prepared to settle the dues of M/s Hariganga Alloys & Steel Ltd in twelve instalments. By
an order dated 22 October 2007, this Court directed the appellant to restore the electricity
connection after receipt of the first two instalments by the respondent in view of the undertaking
given by the respondent that it shall deposit the entire arrears of Rs 83 lakhs in terms of the
proposal dated 9 August 2007. The Court has been informed that pursuant to the order, M/s
Ankush Shikshan Santha had paid the arrears to the tune of Rs 83 lakhs and the appellant has
granted a fresh electricity connection.
229. In the meantime, an Interlocutory Application95 was filed by the respondent for disposing the
petition on the ground that it had become infructuous. The appellant in the reply affidavit has
contested the IA on the ground that even though the principal amount of Rs 83 lakhs has been paid
towards arrears, interest charges to the tune of approximately Rs 2 crore on the principal amount
are still to be recovered.
IA No. 2 of 2007 PART G
230. Since the respondent applied for electricity connection on 17 June 2005, the Maharashtra
Electricity Supply Code 2005, which came into force from 20 January 2005, is applicable in the
instant case. Accordingly, a charge was created on the electricity arrears in terms of Regulation 10.5.
At the same time, the Court cannot be oblivious to the commercial exigencies in view of which the
settlement proposal was complied with. The appellant has recovered an amount of Rs 83 lakhs. In
the facts and circumstances of the case it would be iniquitous to direct the payment of interest at
this stage. We therefore direct a closure of the dispute in the above terms in the exercise of the
jurisdiction under article 142 of the Constitution.
231. In the circumstances, it is not possible to entertain the appeal at this stage. The appeal is
accordingly dismissed. Pending applications, if any, stand disposed of.

232. In 2002, the electricity supply of M/s R & J Alloys Pvt. Ltd was permanently disconnected by
the appellant. On 3 October 2005, the first respondent successfully purchased the properties of M/s
R & J Alloys Pvt. Ltd in an auction held pursuant to a sale conducted for enforcement of a recovery
certificate issued by the Debt Recovery Tribunal. The respondent took over possession of the
property and the sale was confirmed by the order of the Recovery Officer dated 8 December 2005.
The terms of the auction sale of the properties of M/s R & J Alloys Pvt. Ltd stated that the sale was
conducted on “as is where is basis”. PART G
233. On 30 December 2005, the respondent applied to the appellant for a new electricity
connection. This was followed by a subsequent letter dated 2 January 2006. By letter dated 12
January 2006, the appellant refused to give a new electric connection unless the arrears of Rs 11
crores of the erstwhile owner of the property were paid. The respondent filed a writ petition before
the Bombay High Court, seeking an electricity connection. On 13 October 2006, the High Court
passed the impugned order granting interim relief to the first respondent. The High Court took note
of the pending referral of the legal issue to a larger bench of this Court. It observed that the right of
the Electricity Board to claim arrears from auction purchasers hinged upon the adjudication of the
said issued. The High Court directed the Electricity Board to grant interim electricity connection
subject to final adjudication of the rights of the parties.
234. The appellant herein preferred the present Special Leave Petition against the interim order of
the High Court. On 9 July 2007, leave was granted by this Court and the case was tagged with Civil
Appeal No. 5312-5313 of 2005. The impugned order of the High Court granting interim electricity
connection was stayed by this Court.
235. The submission which has been urged by Mr Ajit Bhasme, senior counsel appearing on behalf
of the appellant is that the first respondent knowingly purchased the premises with the liability to
pay past dues, evident from clause 3 and clause 4 of the terms of the auction sale. Accordingly, it has
been urged that the respondent is liable to pay the dues in view of Condition 23(b) of the MSEB
Conditions of Supply. Mr MY Deshmukh, counsel appearing on behalf of the first PART G
respondent has urged that the MSEB Conditions of Supply 1976 are inapplicable after the enactment
of the Maharashtra Electricity Supply Code 2005.
236. The respondent has in its written submissions has brought to the attention of this Court the
suit for recovery96 initiated by the appellant against the erstwhile owner. During the pendency of
the present appeal, the trial court by an order dated 30 September 2009 passed a decree in favour of
the appellant for the debt due from the erstwhile consumer and its proprietor in respect of the
arrears of electricity bills. The first respondent has urged that in view of the decree, the appellant
ought to have withdrawn the present appeal instead of protracting the litigation.
237. At the outset, we would deal with the submissions on the applicability of the 2003 Act. The
electricity connection was permanently disconnected in 2002, and the first respondent acquired
ownership rights in the premises in 2005. The first respondent made the application for a new
electricity connection on 30 December 2005. Hence, the first respondent requested the appellant to
supply electricity after the Maharashtra Electricity Supply Code 2005 came into effect on 20
K.C. Ninan vs Kerala State Electricity Board & ... on 19 May, 2023

January 2005. Accordingly, the Maharashtra Electricity Supply Code 2005 would govern the facts in
the present case. In terms of Regulation 10.5 of the Maharashtra Electricity Supply Code 2005, any
unpaid electricity dues constitute a charge on the premises, and would be recoverable from the new
owner or occupier of the premises to whom the premises have been transferred.
Spl. Civil No. 104 of 2003 PART G
238. Furthermore, the terms of the auction sale put the first respondent on notice that this was a
sale on “as is where is” basis and the purchaser would be liable for arrears of different authorities,
including MSEB, if an excess amount in sale proceeds was not available. The relevant clauses are
extracted below:
“3. So far known to this office there are (no) arrears of Municipal tax, MSEB or
Corporation tax or both taxes. However, any legitimate claim made in that behalf
shall be paid from out of the sale proceeds if the same is in excess of the amount
mentioned in the Recovery Certificate. In case such excess amount is not available
the liability shall be borne by the purchaser. However, prospective purchaser is
expected to check up from MIDC, CIDCO, MSEB, Municipal corporation etc. for the
dues if any on the property.
4. The properties shall be sold on “AS IS WHERE IS BASIS”.” (emphasis supplied)
239. Accordingly, the dues owed by M/s R & J Alloys Pvt. Ltd to the MSEB are a charge on the
property purchased by the first respondent in a public auction. The charge attaches to the property
and a distribution licensee is entitled to recover the unpaid dues from the first respondent subject to
the permitted period specified in the proviso to Regulation 10.5.
240. So far as the filing of civil suit by the appellant in 2003 against the erstwhile owner is
concerned, that is an alternative remedy provided by law which the appellant can undertake in order
to recover electricity arrears from the erstwhile consumer. Besides disconnection of electricity, the
MSEB has the remedy to file civil suits followed by execution petitions for recovery of the dues from
the erstwhile consumer. The filing of the civil suit will not debar the appellant from recovering any
outstanding charge for electricity from a person to whom the PART G property is transferred or the
occupier of the said premises where new electricity connection is sought in terms of Regulation 10.5.
241. The counsel for the respondent has urged that although the decree in the civil suit was passed
in favour of the appellant on 30 September 2009, the appellant has failed to execute it till date. The
distribution licensee should not let arrears mount up and must be prompt in disconnecting
electricity supply and thereafter pursuing its remedy by filing a suit for recovery of moneys/ dues. It
becomes the bounden duty of the distribution licensee to diligently pursue the decree awarded and
recover amounts from the real defaulter. Any amount that may have been realised in the execution
of the decree would have to be given due credit for in determining the amount payable by the
respondent.

242. In view of the reasons which have been adduced earlier, we allow the appeal and set aside the
order of the High Court.
III. Gujarat
243. In Gujarat, the right of the Electric Utilities to demand outstanding dues is traceable to the
following provisions:
a. Up to the enactment of the 2003 Act on 10 June 2003: The governing legislation
consists of the 1910 Act and the 1948 Act. Clause 2(j) of Conditions of Supply of the
Gujarat Electricity Board was inserted by a notification dated 10 August 2001. It
reads:
PART G “2(j) Recovery of old dues:
Reconnection or new connection for any premises, where there are arrears of the Board pending
from the consumer/occupier, shall not be entertained. The new successor/ occupier has to clear
these dues of the previous consumer before the application of successor/occupier is processed for
supply of electricity. If the Board, at a later date, gets the full or part of these dues from the previous
consumer, the amount shall be refunded to the successor/occupier after adjusting the costs
including legal expenses to recover such arrears and the refund shall bear no interest.” b. From 10
June 2003 to 31 March 2005: As per Section 185(2)(a) of the 2003 Act, the extant Conditions of
Supply continued to apply. c. From 31 March 2005 when the Supply Code came into force: Clause
4.1.11 was notified under the Supply Code. The relevant regulation is as follows:
“Regulation 4.1.11 An Application for new connection, reconnection, addition or
reduction of load, change of name or shifting of Service Line need not be entertained
unless any dues of the Applicant to the Distribution Licensee in respect of any other
service connection held in his name anywhere in the jurisdiction of the Distribution
Licensee have been cleared.” d. From 20 August 2010 when the Supply Code was
amended:
Clauses 4.1.11, 4.1.16, and 4.8 of the Supply Code were notified under Section 43 read with Section
50. Clause 4.1.11 post the amendment in 2010 reads thus:
“Clause 4.1.11 PART G An application for new connection, reconnection, addition or reduction of
load, change of name or shifting of service line for any premises need not be entertained unless any
dues relating to that premises or any dues of the applicant to the Distribution Licensee in respect of
any other service connection held in his name anywhere in the jurisdiction of the Distribution
Licensee have been cleared.
Provided that in case the connection is released after recovery of earlier dues from the new applicant
and in case the licensee, after availing appropriate legal remedies, get the full or part of the dues
from the previous consumer/owner or occupier of that premise, the amount shall be refunded to the
K.C. Ninan vs Kerala State Electricity Board & ... on 19 May, 2023

83
new consumer/owner or occupier from whom the dues have been recovered after adjusting the
expenses to recover such dues.” The High Court of Gujarat had occasion to deal with the validity of
Clause 2(j) of the Conditions of Supply and Clause 4.1.11 of the Gujarat Electricity Supply Code.
Item 101.2: M/s Navyug Steel Cast and Anr. v. Paschim Gujarat Vij Co.; Civil Appeal No. 7303 of
2005
244. On 10 August 1998, a petition for winding up of Anik Steel Ltd. was filed wherein an order for
winding up of the company was passed and an Official Liquidator was appointed. By an
advertisement dated 21 December 2001, the Official Liquidator invited tenders for the auction sale
of the property of the previous owner. The appellant submitted an offer of Rs. 35.5 lakhs for
purchase of the property on an “as is where is” basis. The offer letter specified that the petitioner
“shall not be responsible for any of the past dues of the Gujarat Electricity Board, Excise and
Customs Department, Sales Tax and Income Tax PART G Department and of any outsiders whether
it is Government, Semi-Government Corporations and/ or Board, Bank or of any private parties”.
After inter se bidding, the appellant’s offer of Rs. 45.5 lakhs was found to be highest. On 23 July
2022, the Official Liquidator submitted a report before the Gujarat High Court for confirmation of
the sale in favour of the appellant for Rs. 45.5 lakhs. The High Court accepted the sale in favour of
the appellant subject to certain terms and conditions. One such condition was:
“10. The purchaser shall be liable to pay all statutory dues, if any, due and payable on
the properties of the company for the period after the date of winding up. The
payment of such dues for pre-liquidation period shall be settled as per the provisions
of the Companies Act, 1956. However, dues, taxes, cess, if any applicable on the sale
of assets shall be paid by the purchaser.” (emphasis supplied)
245. In accordance with the auction terms laid down by the High Court, the consideration was paid
and possession of the assets was handed over to the appellant. When the appellant applied for a
fresh connection, the respondent insisted on payment of outstanding dues of the previous owner
before granting a fresh connection. The appellant filed a writ petition challenging Clause 2(j) of the
Conditions of Supply. The Single Judge allowed the writ petition and struck down clause 2(j) of the
Conditions of Supply for being arbitrary and inconsistent with statutory provisions of the law. The
respondent preferred special appeals against the judgment of the Single Judge before the Division
Bench. The Division Bnech by judgment dated 18 July 2005 upheld the validity of Clause 2(j) on the
ground that it fell within the ambit and scope of Section 49(1) of the 1948 Act. PART G
246. On 10 August 2001, Gujarat Electricity Board issued a notification under Section 49 of the 1948
Act incorporating Condition 2(j) in the ‘Condition and Miscellaneous Charges for Supply of
Electrical Energy’. Condition 2(j) empowered the Board to insist on payment of arrears of electricity
dues of the former consumer as a condition precedent to the restoration of the earlier connection or
release of a fresh connection in favour of the new owner/occupier of the premises. As discussed in
preceding paragraphs, such conditions can lawfully be stipulated in light of the overall scheme of the
1910 Act and the 1948 Act. Such terms and conditions stipulated in accordance with Section 49 of
the 1948 Act have a statutory character.
K.C. Ninan vs Kerala State Electricity Board & ... on 19 May, 2023
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/160269658/
84
247. On 23 July 2002, the High Court passed an order confirming the sale in favour of the appellant
on the terms and conditions mentioned in the order. The terms and conditions of the auction sale
show that the property was sold on an “as is where is” basis to the appellant. The appellant has
relied on Condition 10 to argue that it was only liable to pay charges accrued after the date of
winding up order. It has been further averred by the appellant that the arrears are for a period
before the date of winding up order, which is 10 August 1998. The facts of the case make it evident
that the appellant requested supply of electricity by a letter dated 12 August 2002. In the present
case, the payment of electricity dues, being statutory in nature, cannot be waived. The auction
conditions are subservient to the statutory demand made under Condition 2(j) of the Conditions of
Supply. Therefore, we uphold the impugned judgment of the High Court. PART G
248. Before parting, we would like to highlight that by an order dated 18 November 2011, this Court
directed the appellant to deposit Rs. 25 lakhs with the respondent and secure the balance principal
amount by giving a bank guarantee of a nationalised bank in the name of the respondent within a
period of eight weeks from the date of the order to obtain a fresh electricity connection. The relevant
part of the said order is reproduced below:
“The principal amount claimed by Paschim Gujarat Vij Company Limited is to the
tune of Rs. 1.26 crores. The applicant-petitioner has applied for grant of fresh
electricity connection which is being denied on the ground that arrears, referred to
above, have not been paid by the previous owner [consumer]. The petitioner is an
auction purchaser. Pending further orders, we direct the petitioner to deposit Rs. 25
lakhs with Respondent No. 1 and secure balance principal amount by giving a Bank
Guarantee of a Nationalised Bank in the name of Paschim Gujarat Vij Company
Limited - Respondent No. 1 within a period of eight weeks from today, without
prejudice to their rights and contentions. Upon compliance of above conditions,
electricity connection shall be granted.”
249. This Court has been informed that the appellant chose not to get the fresh connection in terms
as set out by this Court. Through an Interlocutory Application, the appellant has indicated that it is
impossible for them to pay the total accumulated dues amounting to Rs. 578 lakhs with interest and
other charges. Therefore, the appellant seeks the benefit of the amnesty scheme dated 29 March
2012 issued by the Gujarat government. Further, the appellant submits that it can only clear its
original liability upto Rs. 126 lakhs. The relevant part of the said application is extracted hereunder:
“10. The applicants submit that the applicant is approaching this Hon’ble Court with the intention to
PART G get the benefit of this amnesty scheme of Government of Gujarat for only reasons that if the
applicant succeeds, the Applicant would be required to pay original dues if the applicant lose the
matter in the Hon’ble Supreme Court the liability of the applicant will be only upto Rs. 126.00 Lakhs
(original amount) and the Applicant will not be liable to pay any other delay payment charges and
other charges, etc. Therefore, the applicant prays before this Hon’ble Court that is liability of the
Applicant is fixed only upto the amount of the original dues i.e. Rs. 126.00 Lakhs without any
interest and penalty, etc., the applicant is ready to deposit such sum as is required by this Hon’ble
Court to be deposited with respondent no. 1 and for the balance the applicant is ready to submit the
K.C. Ninan vs Kerala State Electricity Board & ... on 19 May, 2023
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/160269658/
85
bank guarantee and/ or is ready to deposit the whole amount with this Hon’ble Court as security.”
We allow the above application in the interests of equity, justice, and fairness to the extent that the
appellant is only liable to pay the principal amount of Rs. 126 lakhs and any outstanding interest
accrued prior to the date of application for supply of electricity.
Item 101.3: Torrent Power AEC Limited v. M/s Shreeji (Rakhail) Commercial Cooperative Housing
Society Limited & Others; SLP (C) No. 2880 of 2007
250. The appellant is an electric utility engaged in distribution and retail supply of electricity in
Ahmedabad. Raipur Manufacturing Company Ltd, the previous owner, became liable to pay an
amount of Rs. 12 crores towards electricity dues together with running interest thereon. On account
of the outstanding debt, the appellant disconnected electricity supply to the premises of the
company at Ahmedabad on 15 July 1999. In 2001, winding up proceedings were filed against the
previous owner before the Company Court of the High Court of Gujarat. The PART G sale of
property of the previous owner was sanctioned by the High Court of Gujarat by an order dated 2
December 2002 in favour of the respondent. The relevant terms and conditions imposed by the
High Court were:
“1. The sale of properties of the Company shall be on “as is where is and whatever
there is” basis and the Official Liquidator will not transfer the title except the title
which the company was having prior to its liquidation.
***
5. All the statutory dues including the municipal dues, taxes, cess, etc. shall be paid
and borne by the purchaser, Ajar Enterprises Private Limited. The purchaser shall be
solely liable to all levies, charges, claims, arrears, etc. that may be existing or imposed
by any Central, State or local authorities or any other person claiming through them
in whatever manner, on the said properties sold.”
251. After taking possession of the property, the respondent addressed a letter dated 7 January 2004
to the appellant for grant of an electricity connection. However, the appellant declined to grant
supply of electricity unless the respondent paid the pending dues of the erstwhile owner. The
respondent filed a writ petition before the High Court of Gujarat challenging the appellant’s refusal
to grant an electricity connection. Through a common judgment, the Single Judge held that
respondent, being an auction purchaser, cannot be called upon to clear the past arrears of the
previous owners in the absence of any statutory provision. Further, it was observed that there was
no condition between the parties by which the respondents were made liable to pay the arrears of
electricity dues of the previous owners. It was also observed that the state government had not
incorporated any condition similar to Condition 2(j) of the Conditions of Supply in PART G respect
of the Petitioners. The Division Bench in the impugned judgment dated 1 May 2006 upheld the
decision of the Single Judge.
K.C. Ninan vs Kerala State Electricity Board & ... on 19 May, 2023
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/160269658/
86
252. The respondent has submitted that the Gujarat Electricity Supply Code relied upon by the
distribution licensee has no application to the facts of the present case. According to the auction
purchaser, the Gujarat Electricity Supply Code came into force with effect from 31 March 2005,
whereas the respondent auction purchaser applied for electricity on 13 August 2004, that is, much
prior to the Electricity Supply Code having come into effect.
253. In the impugned judgment, the High Court considered the purport of the Regulation 4.1.11 of
the Gujarat Electricity Supply Code and held that it was not applicable to the respondent. According
to the High Court, the sole reason that Regulation 4.1.11 of the Gujarat Electricity Supply Code was
inapplicable was because the said regulations only applied to the electricity dues of the applicant,
and did not make the applicant liable to clear the dues of the previous owner.
254. The High Court omitted to notice that the Gujarat Electricity Supply Code came into force with
effect from 31 March 2005 while the respondent applied for electricity connection on 13 August
2004. Hence, the respondent had applied for a connection before the coming into force of the
Gujarat Electricity Supply Code. Thus, the said regulations will not be applicable to the facts of the
present case.
255. Since the respondent applied for electricity connection on 13 August 2004, the 2003 Act and
the rules and regulations made thereunder are inapplicable in the instant case. It has been admitted
by the appellant that there was no statutory PART G condition requiring the respondents to pay the
outstanding electricity dues of the previous owner at the point of time when they applied for
electricity connection.
256. The appellant has submitted that Ahmedabad Electricity Company,97 the predecessor of the
appellant, notified the Conditions of Supply on 14 October 1994, and that would be applicable. For
the period from 10 June 2003 till 31 March 2005, when the Electricity Supply Code came into force,
the 1994 Conditions of Supply continued to operate in terms of Section 185(2)(a) of the 2003 Act.
Condition 2 of the 1994 Conditions of Supply provided that a requisition for supply of electrical
energy shall be made in accordance with the requisition form attached at Annexure A of the said
conditions and shall be signed by the owner or occupier of the premises for which supply is
required. Annexure A of the said conditions provides a form of requisition for supply of energy. The
requisition form is not only limited to a new connection, but also extends to reconnection, extension
of load, tapping connection, and name change. The form also requires the applicant to pay all the
dues of energy bills and other charges up to the date of transfer. The relevant undertaking is
extracted below:
“I/We hereby give consent to transfer above mentioned service in the name of the
applicant and I/We abide to pay all the dues of energy bills & other charges upto the
date of transfer.”
257. A perusal of Annexure A makes it evident that the above extracted undertaking is actually the
undertaking of a ‘current consumer’ giving consent to transfer the service connection and
undertaking to pay all past dues. This is not an undertaking of an applicant, which has been
K.C. Ninan vs Kerala State Electricity Board & ... on 19 May, 2023
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/160269658/
87
separately provided for in the “AEC” PART G same form. Therefore, Annexure A makes a clear
distinction between a ‘current consumer’ and an applicant for electricity connection. Since the
respondent purchased the said property through an auction-purchase, there was no ‘current
consumer’ to give any consent. Therefore, the undertaking under Form A will not be applicable qua
the respondent. Hence, we find no reason to interfere with the findings of the High Court. The
appeal shall stand dismissed. Item 101.4: Dakshin Gujarat Vij Co. v. Apurva Chemicals, SLP (C) No.
37871 of 2012 and 101.17: Paschim Gujarat Vij Company v. Apurva Chemicals, SLP (C) No. 18280 of
2013
258. A power connection was issued in favour of Arunesh Processors Pvt Ltd, the previous owner.
Due to non-payment of energy bills, the agreement with the power supply company was terminated
with effect from 01 February 1995. In 1995, the appellant filed a suit for recovery of Rs. 3.41 lakhs
against the previous owner before the Civil Judge, Sr. Division, Valsad. In 2002, the suit was
decreed in favour of Gujarat Electricity Board, which was the predecessor of the appellant. Arunesh
Processors Pvt Ltd was wound up in 2002 and its assets were auctioned by the Bombay High Court
on an “as is where is basis”. The respondent participated in the auction proceedings and acquired
the assets of Arunesh Processors Pvt Ltd at Vapi, Gujarat. The sale was confirmed in favour of the
respondent for Rs. 70 lakhs on 11 August 2005 by the Bombay High Court. Thereafter, on 12
December 2008 a deed of conveyance was executed between the Official Liquidator, High Court of
Bombay and the respondent. In 2010, the PART G appellant filed Darkhast No. 7 of 2010 for
execution of the decree passed in the suit in 2002.
259. On 16 December 2010, the respondent approached the appellant requesting it to release power
supply to the plot at Vapi, Gujarat. On 03 January 2011, the appellant informed the respondent that
power supply cannot be released on the plot because Darkhast No. 7 of 2010 was pending and dues
were not recovered from the previous owner. Since the respondent was in need of power supply on
the said plot, it paid the outstanding dues of the previous owner to the tune of Rs. 17 lakhs on 25
February 2011. However, on 17 August 2011, the respondent approached the appellant to refund the
paid amount. The appellant refused to refund the amount, contending that the previous owner had
not yet acknowledged the receipt of their claim. The respondent instituted a writ petition before the
High Court of Gujarat for challenging Clause 4.1.11 of the Gujarat Electricity Supply Code as being
inconsistent with the 2003 Act. The High Court in the impugned judgment dated 03 December 2012
held that Clause 4.1.11 of the Conditions of Supply was ultra-vires the provisions of 2003 Act.
260. It is beyond the pale of doubt that the respondent requested the appellant to release power
supply to their premises on 16 December 2010. At the relevant point of time, the amended Clause
4.1.11 was in force. In the impugned judgment dated 03 December 2012, the High Court held that
the State Commission is not authorised to prescribe a condition under Section 50 of the 2003 Act
for payment of dues of a previous owner or occupier from the new owner as a precondition to supply
electricity. It was further held that Section 43 of the 2003 Act does not PART G impose any
condition for payment of electricity dues attached to the premises before getting supply of
electricity. The High Court observed that the phrase “any dues relating to that premises” conveyed
that the premises were held to be a defaulter of electricity dues and charges, and was inconsistent
with the provisions of the 2003 Act. On the basis of the above reasons, the High Court concluded
K.C. Ninan vs Kerala State Electricity Board & ... on 19 May, 2023
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/160269658/
88
that the first part of Clause 4.1.11 was ultra vires the provisions of Sections 43, 50, 56, and 181 of the
2003 Act.
261. The appellant submitted that the Board is empowered to frame terms and conditions providing
for recovery of electricity dues attached to the premises. It has been further contended that since the
auction was held on “as is where is basis”, the auction purchaser was required to carry out due
diligence in regard to the dues owed against the property being purchased. The appellant has further
submitted that the regulations imposing a condition that the dues relating to particular premises
should be cleared before electricity supply is restored or a new connection is given to the premises
cannot be termed as arbitrary or unreasonable. To reinforce their argument, the appellant has relied
upon the observations made by this Court in Paschimanchal Vidyut Vitran Nigam (supra).
262. On the other hand, the respondent contended that there is no provision under the 2003 Act
enabling the distribution licensee to impose a pre-condition of the clearance of dues relating to the
previous owner or their premises. It has been further argued that Clause 4.1.11 affixing the dues to
the premises is contrary to Section 43 of the 2003 Act, which affixes the liability to pay electricity
PART G dues and charges on the consumer. The dues relating to the premises would be a financial
encumbrance on the property, and as such would be transferred with the sale of the land.
263. In the instant case, the first part of Clause 4.1.11 provides that an application for electricity
supply for any premises need not be entertained unless any dues relating to the premises have been
cleared. The said clause indicates that a distribution licensee can withhold connection to the
premises unless its dues with respect to the said premises have been cleared. In our opinion, the
High Court has erred in observing that the phrase “any dues relating to that premises” is
inconsistent with the provisions of the 2003 Act. The use of the said phrase does not entail that the
premises are deemed to be a defaulter and made liable to pay electricity dues, as the High Court
suggests. According to Clause 4.1.1 of Electricity Supply Code, it is the applicant who has to make an
application in terms of Annexure A and pay all the required electricity dues and charges, including
the electricity arrears of the previous owner relating to the premises. Thus, on the overall reading of
the Electricity Supply Code, it becomes evident that dues of the previous consumer relating to that
premises are sought to be recouped from the new owner or occupier of the premises.
264. In the impugned judgment, the High Court referred to the example of a multi-storied
residential building to observe that “the licensee may successfully demand that a new purchaser of a
different flat whose vendor was not a defaulter, would still be liable to pay the arrears of a defaulting
consumer of another flat of the same on the ground that it is a part of the same premises.” In PART
G this context, we have already held that there is a synergy between the consumer and premises. A
new owner can only be obligated to pay the electricity arrears of the previous owner with respect to
the premises to which electricity connection is being sought. Therefore, the phrase “any dues
relating to that premises” has to be understood with regard to the supply of electricity made to the
premises when it was in occupation of the previous owner.
265. We have already clarified that electricity arrears do not automatically become a charge over the
premises. A Statutory charge is created only where there is an express provision of law providing for
K.C. Ninan vs Kerala State Electricity Board & ... on 19 May, 2023
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/160269658/
89
creation of a statutory charge upon the transferee. Clause 4.1.11 does not have the effect of creating a
charge on the property as it does not specifically provide for creation of a statutory charge. Besides,
the phrase “any dues relating to that premises” cannot be interpreted to impute financial liability on
the premises.
266. Moreover, the High Court has held that the 2003 Act does not enable the Electric Utilities to
frame conditions to recover dues of a previous consumer from a subsequent owner or occupier. We
disagree with this reasoning of the High Court in view of our analysis in the preceding paragraphs,
where we have held that the Electric Utilities can specify the requirement that the subsequent owner
or occupier of the premises has to pay the arrears of electricity dues of the previous consumer as a
pre-condition for the grant of an electricity connection. However, such terms and conditions of
supply should be valid and reasonable by conforming to the overall scheme and purpose of the 2003
Act. PART G
267. Consequently, we set aside the impugned judgment of the High Court dated 2 December 2012.
Any pending IAs are disposed of accordingly. Item 101.5: Madhya Gujarat Vij Co. Ltd. v. Agriculture
Produce Market Committee, SLP (C) No. 8197-8198 of 2014
268. Rajprakash Spinning Mills Ltd.98 was a consumer of the Gujarat Electricity Board since 1967.
On 31 December 1994, its power was disconnected due to the non-payment of electricity dues. On 18
July 1995, the Gujarat Electricity Board instituted a suit in the Civil Court, Nadiad against RSML for
recovery of electricity charges amounting to Rs. 78 lakhs. In the meantime, RSML went into
liquidation and the High Court appointed the Official Liquidator. On 20 August 2002, the suit was
decreed in favour of the Electricity Board. In 2003, the Board lodged a claim before the Official
Liquidator with decree in the suit for Rs. 78 lakhs and legal expenses and interest up to December
2002, which cumulatively amounted to Rs. 1.39 crores.
269. On 17 December 2003, the Official Liquidator executed a sale deed in favour of the respondent.
The sale deed specifically mentions the liability of the purchaser about the dues. On 25 February
2004, a revised sale deed was registered and executed in favour of the respondent and the said sale
deed was executed by the Official Liquidator in pursuance of the confirmation of the sale for a
consideration of Rs. 97 lakhs.
270. On 10 April 2007, the respondent addressed a letter to the appellant for release of the
electricity connection. On 13 April 2007, the appellant declined to “RSML” PART G grant a new
connection unless the electricity charges amounting to Rs. 78 lakhs outstanding against the
premises were paid. The respondent filed a writ petition for the grant of an electricity connection.
The petition was dismissed by a Single Judge by an order dated 08 September 2009 on the ground
that the person who purchased the premises had to pay the electricity dues of the previous occupant.
The Division Bench in the impugned judgment dated 16 July 2013 held that the subsequent
purchaser is not liable to pay the electricity dues of the previous owner.
271. The auction-purchaser submitted an application for a new electric connection on 10 April 2007.
The Gujarat Electricity Supply Code was notified on 31 March 2005. At the relevant time,
K.C. Ninan vs Kerala State Electricity Board & ... on 19 May, 2023

unamended Regulation 4.1.11 was applicable, according to which only the dues of the applicant to
the distribution licensee had to be cleared for the grant of a new connection or for reconnection of
electric supply. The said regulation did not obligate the new owner to clear the electricity dues of the
previous owner. Therefore, the respondent could not have been made liable to pay the arrears of the
previous owner as a pre-condition to obtain a new electricity connection.
272. In view of the above reasons, we uphold the impugned judgment dated 16 July 2013 of the High
Court. The appeal shall stand dismissed. PART G Item 101.6: Torrent Power Limited v. M/s
Shashwat Homes Private Limited;
SLP No. 19878 of 2007
273. Gujarat Steel Tubes Company99, the previous owner, was subjected to liquidation proceedings
and the electricity connection was disconnected for non- payment of dues amounting to Rs. 1.5
crores. GSTC was ordered to be wound up by the Gujarat High Court. A parcel of the GSTC’s land
was bought in auction by Spectra Enterprises Private Limited for a sum of Rs. 42.10 crores. In 2006,
the name of the respondent came to be mutated in the revenue records pertaining to the said parcel
of land. On 24 January 2007, the respondent approached the appellant seeking a new connection
for electricity in respect of the premises. The appellant declined to grant a new connection pending
the payment of the outstanding electricity dues of the previous owner. The respondent instituted a
writ petition before the Gujarat High Court. By the impugned judgment dated 31 January 2014, the
High Court held that the subsequent owner is not liable to pay the electricity dues of the previous
owner.
274. The respondent approached the appellant for seeking a new electricity connection on 24
January 2007. At the relevant time, the 2005 Electricity Supply Code was in force. Regulation 4.1.11
of the 2005 Electricity Supply Code required only the dues of the applicant, if any, to be paid at the
time of the application for a new connection. In the affidavit filed before the High Court, the
appellant conceded that unamended Regulation 4.1.11 was applicable to the respondent, who is the
auction-purchaser. The facts of the present clearly demonstrate that on 24 January 2007, when the
auction-purchaser applied for “GSTC” PART G electricity, unamended Clause 4.1.11 was operational
and applicable. Therefore, the respondent cannot be made liable to clear the dues of the previous
owner in the absence of any express statutory condition in that regard. The impugned judgment of
the High Court is upheld. The appeal shall stand dismissed. Item 101.7: Dakshin Gujarat Vij Co. Ltd
v. Amardeep Association; SLP (C) No. 73 of 2015
275. In 1994, Navsari Cotton and Silk Mills Ltd100 was declared a sick industrial unit. As on the
date of NCSML’s closure, it owed outstanding electricity dues of Rs. 416.36 lakhs. On 17 October
1994, the electricity supply was permanently disconnected. On 15 December 1996, the Board for
Industrial and Financial Reconstruction101 prepared a New Rehabilitation Scheme under Section 18
of SICA. The said scheme provided for sale of surplus land of NCSML under paragraph 2(g):
“(g) The plant and machinery of the weaving section and the process house along
with its building and the surplus land with the company are proposed to be disposed
K.C. Ninan vs Kerala State Electricity Board & ... on 19 May, 2023

91
of and the sale proceeds of about Rs. 500 lakhs would be utilised for the
implementation of the scheme.”
276. Pursuant to the Rehabilitation Scheme of 1996, the Government of Gujarat passed a resolution
inter alia granting (i) permission for sale of surplus land of NCSML; and (ii) exemption from power
cut for five years to NCSML with the condition that, any reconnection charges as in the case of
arrears shall be given to the Gujarat Electricity Board in instalments. Later, in 1997, the workers of
“NCSML” “BIFR” PART G NCSML decided to form a co-operative by the name Morarji Desai Textile
Labour Co-operative Society Industries Limited102 to take over the unit of the company for its
revival.
277. In 2003, the BIFR directed the disposal of the surplus land of the said company by constituting
an Assets Sale Committee. The notice for sale of the surplus land was published in Gujarat
Samachar in 2003 under which the land was to be sold on “as is where is basis”. The relevant extract
of the notice is set out below:
“As per the order of the B.I.F.R., the land situated at Vijalpore bearing Survey No.
336/1, 311, 310/1, 310/2, 310/5, 310/7, 307/1, 308/1 having ownership of Navsari
Cotton and Silk Mills, out of total admeasuring area of the land, 11 Lakh square feet
land with possession is to be given on AS IS WHERE IS BASIS as per the prevailing
laws and rules.”
278. The Assets Sale Committee accepted the offer made by respondent for a consideration of Rs.
561 lakhs for the surplus land. The sale deed dated 29 May 2003 mentioned that the additional open
land was free from all encumbrances including lien and charge. Clause 9 further specified that “all
taxes, land revenue, education cess, and other outstanding dues up to date has been paid and if any
dues remain unpaid that is to be paid by the Company.”
279. On 01 December 2004, the respondent applied for a new connection. However, the appellant
refused to grant a new connection until the outstanding dues were cleared in terms of Clause 2(j) of
the Conditions of Supply. In 2006, the respondent moved an application before the BIFR for a
direction to release “MDTLCIL” PART G power supply. On 12 June 2006, the BIFR sanctioned a
Revised Rehabilitation Scheme directing the appellant to release an electricity connection to the
respondent. Since the electricity supply was not released, the respondent instituted a writ petition
before the High Court of Gujarat. In 2010, a Single Judge of the High Court allowed the writ petition
by directing the appellant to release the electricity connection to the residential establishments on
the surplus land without insisting on the payment of the dues of the previous owner. The Single
Judge held that Clause 2(j) was not applicable because the worker’s co-operative society was a going
concern and the Electricity Board can recover the dues from them. The Division Bench in the
impugned judgment dated 21 November 2014 upheld the decision of the Single Judge. The Court
held that the BIFR scheme would be binding on the appellant even though they were not a party to
the proceedings. It was further held that SICA is a special Act in comparison to the 2003 Act.
Therefore, a scheme framed under SICA was held to have an overriding effect over Clause 2(j) of the
Conditions of Supply.
K.C. Ninan vs Kerala State Electricity Board & ... on 19 May, 2023

280. The respondent has contended that according to the BIFR Scheme, electricity connection was
provided to MDTLCIL separately and not to the surplus land sold to the respondent. Hence, no dues
could have been recoverable from the respondent. The respondent further contended that the
rehabilitation schemes framed by BIFR have an overriding effect on the terms and conditions
stipulated under Clause 2(j) of the Conditions of Supply. The respondents have also drawn attention
to Clauses 3 and 9 of the sale deed which exempted the respondent from the payment of the past
dues of NCSML. The said clauses are extracted below:
PART G “(3) [...] On the said property, there is no debt i.e. lien or charge of anybody and is not
under seize, attachment, or injunction of any court. [...] On the said property, nobody has
maintenance and residence charge on it, there is no charge of Government taxes/duties like, Income
Tax, Sales Tax, etc. on said property. There is no acquisition, requisition, or reservation of
Government or local body or with that intention any notice in not served to the company. In short,
there is no one claiming right title or claim as mortgage, claimant, shareholder or by other way or
any other interest in the said property and the company has all rights and authority for managing
the said property by all way and by giving such trust and assurance, the company has executed this
sale deed. And even if, in future, any one claims right on the property, then risk thereof stands on
the company and that is if due to such right or chapter if any loss or expenses occurred by you or
your heirs, that is to be repaid by the company.” [...] (9) All taxes, land revenue, education cess, and
other outgoings related to the said property and outstanding dues upto date has been paid and if any
dues remains to be paid that is to be paid by the company.
Now onwards, the responsibility for payment of all taxes, etc. related to the said property will be on
the first party. By support of this deed the purchaser can enter its name on said property in
Government, Semi-
Government and local records, City Survey Records and Municipal Records and for that we have to
give our signature, consent, and such signed consent admitted being considered.” (emphasis
supplied)
281. To decide this issue, the question that arises before us is whether SICA is special legislation in
relation to the 1910 Act and 2003 Act. SICA was enacted with a view to secure the timely detection
of sick companies and speedy determination of the preventive, ameliorative, remedial and other
measures which need to be taken with respect to such companies. Section 18 mandated an operating
agency such as a BIFR to prepare a scheme providing for transfer of PART G business, properties,
assets, and liabilities of the sick industrial company on terms and conditions as specified in the
scheme. According to Section 18(8) of SICA, once the scheme is sanctioned, it is binding on the sick
industrial company as well as the shareholders, creditors, and guarantors of the sick industrial
company. Section 32 of the SICA gave overriding effect to any rules or schemes made under the
provisions of the Act:
“32. Effect of the Act on other laws.—(1) The provisions of this Act and of any rules or
schemes made thereunder shall have effect notwithstanding anything inconsistent
therewith contained in any other law except the provisions of the Foreign Exchange
K.C. Ninan vs Kerala State Electricity Board & ... on 19 May, 2023
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/160269658/
93
Regulation Act, 1973 (46 of 1973), and the Urban Land (Ceiling and Regulation) Act,
1976 (33 of 1976), for the time being in force or in the Memorandum or Articles of
Association of an industrial company or in any other instrument having effect by
virtue of any law other than this Act. *** (emphasis supplied)
282. In Tata Motors Ltd v. Pharmaceutical Products of India Ltd103 this Court held that SICA is a
special legislation in comparison to the Companies Act. The Court observed:
“22. The provisions of a special Act will override the provisions of a general Act. The
latter of it (sic Act) will override an earlier Act. The 1956 Act is a general Act. It
consolidates and restates the law relating to companies and certain other
associations. It is prior in point of time to SICA.
23. Wherever any inconstancy (sic inconsistency) is seen in the provisions of the two Acts, SICA
would prevail. SICA furthermore is a complete code. It contains a non obstante clause in Section
(2008) 7 SCC 619 PART G
24. SICA is a special statute. It is a self-contained code. The jurisdiction of the Company Judge in a
case where reference had been made to BIFR would be subject to the provisions of SICA.” (emphasis
supplied)
283. The 2003 Act also contains a provision similar to Section 32 of SICA. Section 174 of the 2003
Act provides that the provisions of the said Act will have overriding effect notwithstanding anything
contained in any other law for the time being in force. It therefore becomes evident that both SICA
and 2003 Act are special laws in their respective field.
284. In LIC v. D J Bahadur,104 this Court was confronted with the question as to whether the LIC
Act is a special legislation or a general legislation with respect to the Industrial Disputes Act, 1947.
Justice V R Krishna Iyer (supra) held that in determining whether a particular statute is general or
special, the focus has to be on the principal subject matter and the particular perspective. On the
basis of the observation that a legislation may be general for some purposes and special for other
purposes it was held that the Industrial Disputes Act, 1947 being a special law, prevails over the LIC
Act. It was held:
“52. In determining whether a statute is a special or a general one, the focus must be
on the principal subject-matter plus the particular perspective. For certain purposes,
an Act may be general and for certain other purposes it may be special and we cannot
blur distinctions when dealing with finer points of law. In law, we have a cosmos of
relativity, not absolutes — so too in life.” (1981) 1 SCC 315 PART G
285. In UP State Electricity Board v. Hari Shankar Jain,105 a three-judge Bench of this Court was
called upon to determine whether the Industrial Employment (Standing Orders) Act, 1946 is a
special legislation and overrides the 1948 Act in regard to the age of superannuation. Justice O
Chinnappa Reddy, speaking on behalf of the Bench held that the Industrial Employment (Standing
K.C. Ninan vs Kerala State Electricity Board & ... on 19 May, 2023
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/160269658/
94
Orders) Act, 1946 is a special legislation dealing with the conditions of service of workmen in
industrial establishments. On the other hand, the 1948 Act is an act to coordinate the development
of electricity, and does not seek to regulate the conditions of services of the employees of the State
Electricity Board. The Court held that the 1948 Act is a special legislation in regard to the subject of
development of electricity. It was observed:
“7. [...] The Electricity Supply Act does not presume to be an Act to regulate the
conditions of service of the employees of State Electricity Boards. It is an Act to
regulate the co-ordinated development of electricity. It is a special Act in regard to
the subject of development of electricity, even as the Industrial Employment
(Standing Orders) Act is a special act in regard to the subject of conditions of service
of workmen in industrial establishments. If Section 79(c) of the Electricity Supply Act
generally provides for the making of regulations providing for the conditions of
service of the employees of the Board, it can only be regarded as a general provision
which must yield to the special provisions of the Industrial Employment (Standing
Orders) Act in respect of matters covered by the latter Act.”
286. Keeping the above principle in mind, it is necessary to examine the subject matter of SICA and
the 2003 Act. Under SICA, the operating agency had to prepare a scheme with respect to a sick
industrial company providing for financial (1978) 4 SCC 16 PART G reconstruction, proper
management, amalgamation, and any other preventive, ameliorative, and remedial measures. On
the other hand, the 2003 Act is a consolidating law relating to generation, transmission,
distribution, trading, and use of electricity. The 2003 Act relates specifically to supply of electricity
to consumers, whereas SICA is silent on the aspects of the supply of electricity to consumers. The
principal subject matter of SICA is to provide ameliorative measures for reconstruction of sick
companies, while the purpose of the 2003 Act is development of the electricity industry. Thus, the
purpose of the two enactments is entirely different. The 2003 Act is a later enactment, and Section
175 specifically provides that the provisions of the Act are in addition and not in derogation of any
other law for the time being in force, including the SICA.
287. In KSL & Industries Ltd v. Arihant Threads Ltd,106 a three-judge Bench of this Court was
called upon to decide which enactment between the SICA and Recovery of Debts Due to Banks and
Financial Institutions Act, 1993107 would prevail over the other. The Court observed that although
both the legislations are special laws in relation to their respective subject matters, SICA would
prevail over the RDDB Act by virtue of the incorporation of a non-derogation clause in the latter. In
the RDDB Act, Parliament had specifically provided that the RDDB Act shall be in addition to and
not in derogation of other laws mentioned therein including SICA:
“49. The term “not in derogation” clearly expresses the intention of Parliament not to
detract from or abrogate the provisions of SICA in any way. This, in effect must mean
that Parliament (2015) 1 SCC 166 “RDDB Act” PART G intended the proceedings
under SICA for reconstruction of a sick company to go on and for that purpose
further intended that all the other proceedings against the company and its
properties should be stayed pending the process of reconstruction. While the term
K.C. Ninan vs Kerala State Electricity Board & ... on 19 May, 2023
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/160269658/
95
“proceedings” under Section 22 of SICA did not originally include the RDDB Act,
which was not there in existence Section 22 covers proceedings under the RDDB
Act.” (emphasis supplied)
288. Similarly, Section 175 of the 2003 Act provides that the provisions of the Act are in addition
and not in derogation of any other law for the time being in force. Therefore, by specifically
providing that the 2003 Act shall be in addition to and not in derogation of any other laws for time
being in force, the Parliament has preserved and give precedence to the proceedings under SICA.
Section 32 of SICA provides an overriding effect to a scheme framed under it. Section 18 of the SICA
mandates an operating agency such as BIFR to prepare a scheme providing for transfer of business,
properties, assets, and liabilities of the sick industrial company on terms and conditions as may be
specified in the scheme.
289. SICA is a special statute and Section 32 read with Section 18(8) of the SICA gives an overriding
effect to the Scheme. The 1996 Rehabilitation Scheme and the 2006 Revised Rehabilitation Scheme
bind the appellant, but override Clause 2(j) of the terms and conditions of supply.
290. Applying the above position of law to the facts of the present case, it is apparent that the
respondent purchased ‘surplus land’ of NCSML in pursuance of the rehabilitation scheme framed by
BIFR. When the respondent was given possession of the land in 2003, NCSML was a going concern
as it continued to PART G be operated by MDTLCIL. The relevant clauses of the sale deed expressly
excluded the respondent from the past dues of NCSML. In fact, the Clause 9 of the sale deed
reiterated that NCSML would be responsible to pay any outstanding dues related to the land.
Further, the 2006 Revised Rehabilitation Scheme solely puts the onus of clearance of electricity
arrears on NCSML, while directing the appellant to release electricity connection to the respondent.
Thus, NCSML being the consumer, was obligated to clear the arrears of electricity pertaining to the
said premises. The appellant could only recover dues from NCSML, since it was a going concern at
the time when the respondent applied for supply of electricity. It is admittedly the case that the
appellant did not institute any proceeding for recovery of dues from NCSML. This has been
observed in the judgment dated 14 June 2010 of the High Court:
“Under these circumstances, no recovery was made by Respondent against NCSML.
If no recovery were made against NCSML, the demand of dues against the Petitioner
(respondent herein) which is the purchaser of portion of land owners by NCSML is
not sustainable.”
291. The High Court has rightly observed that the appellant cannot selectively withhold electricity to
the respondent under the guise of demand for past electricity arrears. The stance of the appellant is
opposed to the rehabilitation scheme framed by the BIFR. The Revised Rehabilitation Scheme
formulated by the BIFR will be binding on the appellant by virtue of Section 18(8) of SICA.
According to the said provision, once a scheme is sanctioned, it shall not only bind the sick
industrial company and the transferee company, but also creditors such as the appellant. The
statutory provision is extracted below: PART G “18. Preparation and sanction of Schemes -
K.C. Ninan vs Kerala State Electricity Board & ... on 19 May, 2023
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/160269658/
96
(8) On and from the date of the coming into operation of the sanctioned scheme or any provision
thereof, the scheme or such provision shall be binding on the sick industrial company and the
transferee company or, as the case may be, the other company and also on the shareholders,
creditors and guarantors and employees of the said companies.”
292. On 20 March 2015, a two-judge Bench of this Court passed an interim order staying the
operation of the impugned judgment in the following terms:
“The impugned judgment and order dated 21.11.2014 passed by the High Court of
Gujarat is stayed subject to Respondent No. 1 furnishing a bank guarantee of 50% of
the total dues.
It is made clear that the electricity will be supplied only on furnishing the aforesaid
bank guarantee. Such of those purchasers who wish to pay the amount due to the
petitioner are permitted to do so. The petitioner will consider the case on merits and
take a decision on providing the electricity connection.”
293. We accordingly vacate the stay on the impugned judgment dated 21 November 2014. Any
amount furnished by the respondent shall be refunded back. The appeal shall stand dismissed.
Item 101.8: Paschim Gujarat Vij Company Limited v. Sarifaben Mehboobbhai Solanki, SLP (C) No.
13400/2018
294. The electricity supply of Kanti Cotton Mills Pvt Ltd, the previous owner, was disconnected on
09 June 1981. The mill was deemed to be a ‘relief undertaking’ under Section 3 of the Bombay Relief
Undertakings (Special PART G Provisions) Act, 1958. In 1982, Gujarat State Textile Corporation108
took over the management of the Mill under the Industries (Development and Regulation) Act, 1951.
In 1996, the BIFR submitted its report stating that huge losses were being suffered and
recommended winding up under Section 20 of SICA. In 1997, the Company Court ordered winding
up and appointed the Official Liquidator. On 21 October 1997, GSTC requested a disconnection of
electricity supply in view of the winding up proceedings. On 22 July 1998, a court auction was held
for the sale of immovable property. The offer of Jay Mahakali Infrastructure Pvt Ltd.109 was found
acceptable and confirmed by the High Court. On 28 June 2004, a sale deed was executed in favour
of JMIPL for a consideration of Rs. 5.5 crores.
295. On 23 May 2005, the appellant served a notice on JMIPL demanding payment of Rs. 2.3
crores. On 05 September 2006, a Single Judge allowed the petition which was instituted by JMIPL
by holding that the claim of the appellant for arrears of electricity dues, being in the nature of a
money claim, was required to be lodged within 3 years, and was barred by limitation. The appeal
was dismissed by the Division Bench by a judgment dated 04 April 2014 on the ground that the
appropriate remedy available to the appellant was to file a civil suit or get a garnishee order so that
the purchaser would know that there is a liability on the property in question. On 16 December
2016, the High Court dismissed the review petition preferred by the appellant on the ground of
delay.

296. The respondents purchased a small residential house from JMIPL in 2012. On 4 October 2014,
the respondents applied for the grant of an electricity “GSTC” “JMIPL” PART G connection. Since
the request was not acceded to, the respondent instituted a complaint before the Consumer
Grievances Redressal Forum seeking a connection without insistence on the dues of the earlier
owner as they had purchased the plot from JMIPL. The forum disposed of the case in light of Clause
4.1.11 of the Electricity Supply Code, which was amended in 2010. The respondent approached the
Electricity Ombudsman, who relied upon the previous order of the High Court to direct the
appellant to supply electricity to the respondents by an order dated 30 March 2015. The appellants
filed a Special Civil Application before the High Court against the order of the Ombudsman. On 16
February 2016, the Single Judge of the High Court dismissed the application. The Division Bench of
the High Court by judgment dated 8 September 2017 declined to interfere on the ground that a
Special Leave Petition110 preferred before this Court against the order dated 4 April 2014 was
dismissed.
297. It is important to reiterate that the appellant had also denied an electricity connection to
JMIPL, the predecessor-in-title of respondent. However, JMIPL filed a petition under Article 226,
which was allowed by a Single Judge of the High Court. The appellant filed a Letters Patent appeal,
which was dismissed by the Division Bench of the High Court by a judgment dated 04 April 2014 on
the ground of limitation. The Ombudsman, in its order dated 30 March 2015, based its decision on
this judgment of the Division Bench. The judgment dated 04 April 2014 attained finality. The right
of the respondent to receive supply of electricity stood crystallised on the judgment attaining finality
upon the dismissal of the Special Leave Petition filed by the appellant. Therefore, the order passed
by the Diary No. 23261 of 2017 PART G Ombudsman, and the subsequent orders passed by the High
Court affirming the decision of the Ombudsman, do not suffer from any infirmity. The impugned
judgment of the High Court is upheld for that reason. The appeal shall stand dismissed.
Item 101.16: Torrent Power Ltd. v. M/s Abhisar Developers, SLP(C) 9092-
9094 of 2013
298. On 01 September 1986, New Gujarat Synthetic Company, the previous owner, went into
liquidation. On 12 September 1986, the electricity connection to the premises of the previous owner
was disconnected for non-payment of dues amounting to Rs. 77 lakhs. On 12 October 2006, a public
auction was conducted of the immovable properties of the previous owner, including their premises.
These were purchased by Star Associates and conveyed to Abhisar Developers, the respondent
herein.
299. On 28 December 2006, the respondent-purchaser applied for a new connection for the
premises. However, the appellant called upon the respondent to clear the outstanding dues of the
premises. In 2007, the respondent filed a writ petition before the High Court of Gujarat praying for
new connection without payment of the arrears. In 2010, the High Court allowed the petition and
directed the Licensee to provide the connection. On 3 December 2012, the Division Bench of the
High Court held that the Clause 4.1.11 of the Gujarat Electricity Supply Code, as amended in 2010, is
ultra vires the provisions of the 2003 Act.
K.C. Ninan vs Kerala State Electricity Board & ... on 19 May, 2023

98
300. The appellant has referred to Clauses 4.1.16, 4.8.1, and 4.8.4 of the Electricity Supply Code to
argue that the auction-purchaser cannot deny PART G knowledge of the requirement to clear the
outstanding dues of the premises. In response, the auction-purchaser has submitted that there was
no statutory provision at the relevant time requiring the payment of the dues of the previous owner
from the subsequent owner as a condition precedent for providing for a fresh connection.
301. The relevant Clauses 4.1.16, 4.8.1, and 4.8.4 of the 2005 Electricity Supply Code are extracted
hereunder:
“4.1.16 The Distribution Licensee shall give no dues certificate to consumer on his
request to avoid any possibilities of pending dues of previous owner while purchasing
new house/ premises.
[...] 4.8.1 The Consumer shall not without prior consent in writing of the Distribution
Licensee assign, transfer or part with the benefit of the Agreement executed with the
Distribution Licensee nor shall part with or create any partial or separate interest
there under in any manner. Transfer of service connection will be effected on
application in case the registered Consumer is dead or if the ownership or occupation
of the property has changed or transferred. In all cases of such transfers, the arrears
of every description shall be paid in full together with transfer fee as prescribed in
relevant GERC Regulations.
[...] 4.8.4 Where Premises to which electricity is supplied by Licensee is transferred to transferee
and the transferee does not get service connection in the Premises transferred to his name, and
continues to use the service connection in previous name, the transferee shall be responsible for
payment of running energy bills as well as unpaid dues of energy bills and other amounts relating to
the service connection. The dues to the Distribution Licensee shall be payable on demand, in default
of which the supply to the Premises may be disconnected, subject to the provisions of the Acts, rules,
and regulations for the time being in force. “ PART G
302. Clause 4.1.16 of the Gujarat Electricity Supply Code obligated the distribution licensee to
provide no-dues certificate when requested by a consumer “to avoid any possibilities of pending
dues of the previous owner while purchasing new house/premises.” This is only a procedural
provision and does not per se impose any obligation on the subsequent owner of the premises. The
term “consumer” will not bring an auction-purchaser within the ambit of Clause 4.1.16 as an
auction-purchaser does not become a consumer before entering into an agreement with the
distribution licensee.
303. According to Clause 4.8.1, a consumer shall not transfer a service connection without the prior
consent of the distribution licensee. It further provides that transfer of a service connection will be
effected on application in case the registered consumer is dead or if the ownership or occupation of
property has changed or been transferred. In case of a transfer, the clause provides that arrears of
every description shall be paid in full together with the transfer fee. However, the said provision
only applies in situations where there has been a transfer of a service connection. In the facts of the
K.C. Ninan vs Kerala State Electricity Board & ... on 19 May, 2023
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/160269658/
99
present case, we are dealing with a situation where the auction-purchaser applied for a new
connection of electricity to the premises. Therefore, Clause 4.8.1 will not be applicable to the facts of
the present case.
304. Clause 4.8.4 provides that a transferee of premises would be liable for the unpaid dues of
energy bills of the defaulter transferor only if they continue to use the service connection in the
previous name without transferring to their name. The said clause is only applicable where a
transferee applies for a transfer of PART G connection, and not where a transferee applies for a new
power connection in their own name.
305. In the present matter, from the perusal of facts, it is evident that the respondent applied for a
fresh electricity connection for the premises on 28 December 2006. Therefore, on the date of the
submission of the application for electricity by the respondent, the unamended Clause 4.1.11 of the
Gujarat Electricity Supply Code was in force, according to which only the dues of the applicant to the
distribution licensee had to be cleared for a new connection or reconnection of electric supply. There
was no statutory provision requiring the auction purchasers to clear the arrears of the previous
owner as a condition precedent for getting a fresh connection.
306. It was only in 2010 that clause 4.1.11 of the said Electricity Supply Code was amended which
required the subsequent owner of the premises to clear the dues of the previous owner as a
condition precedent for receiving a new electricity connection. Thus, at the time when the
respondent applied for a fresh connection of electric supply, there was no existing provision
requiring the applicant of a new connection to clear the dues of the previous owner linked to the
premises. Therefore, the judgment dated 3 December 2012 of the High Court has to be upheld. The
appeal shall stand dismissed.
IV. Assam
307. The Assam Electricity Regulatory Commission framed the AERC Supply Code on 30 August
2004 in exercise of its power under Section 50 of the 2003 PART G Act to provide for recovery of
electricity charges. Clause 3.6 deals with requisition of supply. Clause 3.6.4 is extracted below:
“3.6.4 In case of a person occupying a new property, it will be the obligation of that
person to check the bills for the previous months or, in case of disconnected supply,
the amount due as per the licensee's records immediately before his occupation and
ensure that all outstanding electricity dues as specified in the bills subject to
limitation as per sub-section (2) of Section 56 of the Act are duly paid up and
discharged. The licensee shall be obliged to issue a certificate of the amount
outstanding from the connection in such premises on request made by such person.”
The impugned clause obligates a new occupier of a premises to check the bills for
previous months and ensure that all the outstanding amounts are duly paid up and
discharged.

Item 101.15: Carbon Resources v. Assam Electricity Regulatory Commission; SLP(C) No. 24502 of
2010
308. The previous owner, Eastern Steel and Alloys Company Ltd, had electricity dues pending for
the period 1988-1989, due to which electricity supply was disconnected in 1992. The Assam State
Electricity Board111 filed a money suit before the District Judge against the previous owner, which
was decreed in its favour for Rs 2.07 crore on 24 February 1997. On account of the liabilities due to
UCO Bank, a warrant of attachment was levied on 30 June 2004.
309. In 2002, UCO Bank preferred an application against the previous owner before the Debt
Recovery Tribunal. On 16 March 2007, the Recovery Officer of the Debt Recovery Tribunal,
Guwahati issued an auction sale notice for the land “ASEB” PART G in question. Clause 7 of the
notice of auction sale stipulated that the properties were being sold on “as is where is” basis and
subject to other conditions prescribed in the Second Schedule of the Income Tax Act, 1961 and Rules
made thereunder. The appellant was the highest bidder and was declared as an auction-purchaser
on 20 February 2008. On 24 March 2008, a sale certificate was issued in favour of the appellant and
possession was handed over to the appellant by UCO Bank on 27 March 2008. The Recovery Officer
confirmed the auction sale in favor of the appellant, who took over the possession of the property on
27 March 2008. On 21 January 2009, the appellant applied for a high-tension industries electricity
connection, but ASEB denied it due to pending arrears of the previous owner.
310. Therefore, the appellant filed a writ petition before the Gauhati High Court seeking: (i) an
electricity connection without having to pay the arrears of the previous owner; and (ii) challenging
the vires of Regulation No. 3.6.4 of the AERC Electricity Supply Code. On 2 June 2010, a Division
Bench of the High Court delivered a judgment dismissing the petition.
311. The appellant has drawn the attention of this Court to the fact that the respondent had filed a
suit against the previous consumer, in which a decree was passed. The appellant submits that
recovery of arrears of the previous owner could be effected in execution of the decree. From the
perusal of the facts, it is true that the respondent had already instituted a money suit against the
previous consumer and obtained a decree. However, the respondent has stated before the High
Court that the execution could not be carried out successfully. In these PART G proceedings, we are
not concerned with the validity of the execution proceedings initiated by the respondent against the
previous owner.
312. The respondent has submitted that before purchasing the premises, the appellant was required
to undergo due-diligence and verify that there were no electricity dues in relation to the premises.
The respondent has also questioned the validity of the sale in favor of the appellant on the ground
that there was a subsisting money decree in favour of the respondent and the premises were under
Court attachment. The respondent also referred to a State Government order dated 29 November
2004 directing Deputy Commissioners and Sub- divisional Officers to not issue sale/ transfer
permission of land without clearance of the electricity dues. On 26 June 2006, the electricity
distribution companies also issued a public notice requiring new consumers to clear the dues of the
previous consumer. The relevant extract of the said public notice is hereunder:
K.C. Ninan vs Kerala State Electricity Board & ... on 19 May, 2023
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/160269658/
101
“It is observed that some electricity consumers having outstanding dues payable
against energy consumption are trying to sale or lease out their premises (including
land and building) without clearing the electricity dues. Govt. of Assam has already
prohibited such transfer of premises and made it mandatory to obtain electricity dues
clearance certificate from the concerned officers before applying for permission of
transfer. All prospective buyers or lessee are hereby requested to satisfy themselves
regarding clearance of electricity dues before taking over the possession of such
premises.
In the event of non discharge of liabilities of electricity dues by the previous owner, the purchaser/
lessee will be liable to clear the said dues before power supply provided to them in accordance with
provision of Terms and Condition regulation notified by Assam Electricity Regulatory Commission.”
PART G
313. Therefore, it has been contended by the respondent that the appellants were put to sufficient
notice regarding the requirement of clearing dues before purchasing the property. In the present
proceedings, the validity of the auction sale of the premises to the appellant does not arise for
consideration, as it is a matter to be decided in separate proceedings. We are only concerned with
whether the appellant, being a new owner of the premises, is liable to clear the dues of the previous
consumer before getting a supply of electricity.
314. By the impugned judgment dated 2 June 2010, the High Court has upheld the validity of
Regulation 3.6.4 of the AERC Electricity Supply Code. It held that the stipulation contained in the
said regulation is reasonable and within the ambit of the powers conferred by Section 50 of the 2003
Act. We are of the opinion that the impugned clause is reasonable and consistent with the provisions
of the 2003 Act. Accordingly, the appellant was obligated to check the bills for previous months and
ensure that all the outstanding amounts are duly paid up and discharged. Therefore, we find no
merit in the challenge to the decision of the High Court. However, to balance the interests of parties,
we make it clear that if any arrears of electricity are received from the previous owner, the amount
shall be adjusted with the power bills of the appellant.
V. West Bengal
315. In West Bengal, the WB Electricity Supply Code have been enacted in 2012 under the 2003 Act.
The relevant regulations - Clause 3.4.2, 4.6.1 and 4.6.4
- are set out below:
“3.4.2. The licensee shall be eligible to recover from a new and subsequent consumer(s) the dues of
the PART G previous and defaulting consumers in respect of the same premises only if a nexus
between the previous and the defaulting consumer(s) and the new consumer(s) in respect of the
same premises is proved. The onus of proving a nexus, if claimed by a licensee, shall lie on the
licensee.” 4.6.1. If the power supply to any consumer remains disconnected continuously for a
period of one hundred and eighty days where the disconnection has been effected in compliance
K.C. Ninan vs Kerala State Electricity Board & ... on 19 May, 2023
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/160269658/
102
with any of the provisions of the Act or Regulations, the agreement of the licensee with the
consumer for supply of electricity shall be deemed to have been terminated with consequential effect
on expiry of the said period of one hundred and eighty days. This will be without prejudice to such
other action or the claim that may arise from the disconnection of supply or related issues therefor.
On termination of agreement, the licensee shall have the right to remove the service line and other
installations through which electricity is supplied to the consumer.” “4.6.4. Notwithstanding
anything contained contrary elsewhere in these Regulations where deemed termination of
agreement has taken place, then on the basis of application of any consumer new service connection
can only be provided in the same premises if the outstanding dues against the deemed terminated
consumer is cleared along with the late payment surcharge.”
316. Under Regulation 3.4.2 of the WB Electricity Supply Code, the licensee is entitled to recover the
outstanding dues of the previous owner from the new and subsequent owner if there is a nexus
between the previous owner and the new consumer. Regulation 4.6.1 provides that there shall be a
deemed termination of agreement if the power supply to any consumer remains disconnected for a
continuous period of 180 days. Regulation 4.6.4 overrides other provisions of the WB Electricity
Supply Code as it contains a non-obstante clause. Under Regulation 4.6.4, a new consumer can be
given a service connection only if the PART G outstanding dues against the same premises is cleared
along with late payment surcharge.
Item 101.18: Damodar Valley Corporation v. Sree Ramdoot Rollers Private;
SLP (C) No. 15723 of 2020
317. On 30 June 2012, the appellant electricity utility, Damodar Valley Corporation, and Capricorn
Ispat Udyog Private Limited, the previous owner, entered into an agreement for supply of electrical
energy. The bank guarantees furnished by the respondent expired on 4 June 2014. The electricity
connection to the previous owner was disconnected on 21 September 2016 for default in payment of
electricity dues to the suit premises. On 14 August 2018, the State Bank of India advertised the
property for e-auction under SARFAESI Act for default of dues on “as is where is basis”. The
relevant terms and condition of e- auction sale are as follows:
1. “E-auction is being held on AS IS WHERE IS and will be conducted online. ***
2. [To] the best of knowledge and information of the authorised officer there is no
encumbrance of the properties. However, the intending bidders should make their
own independent enquiries regarding the encumbrance title of properties put on
auction and claim rights dies affecting the properties [prior] to submitting their bid.
The E-auction advertisement does not constitute and will not be deemed to constitute
any commitment or any representation of the bank. The properties is being sold with
all the existing and future encumbrance whether known or unknown to the bank and
authorised officer secured creditor shall not be responsible in any way for the third
party claims, rights, dues.

103
***
7. It shall be the responsibility of the interested bidders to inspect and satisfy themselves about the
properties before submission of the bid.” PART G Clause 1 of the terms and conditions provided that
the e-auction was being held on an “as is where is basis”. Clause 2 provided that the property was
being sold with all present and future encumbrances, whether known or unknown to the bank.
Clause 7 provided that it was the responsibility of interested bidders to inspect and satisfy
themselves about the properties before submission of the bid.
318. On 31 August 2018, the assets of the previous owner were taken over by Magnum Tradelink
Private Limited through an e-auction. The registration of property was done in the name of Shree
Ramdoot Rollers Private Limited, who is the respondent herein. On 04 October 2018, the
respondent filed an application seeking a new connection from the appellant. When the appellant
refused, the respondent filed a writ petition before the High Court of Calcutta. On 17 April 2019, the
Single Judge allowed the petition and ordered the appellant to process the respondent’s application
within a period of three weeks. However, by its letter dated 10 May 2019 the appellant refused to
grant a connection in view of the electricity dues of Rs. 22.05 crores payable by the erstwhile owner
in respect of premises. The respondent again approached the High Court seeking a direction for the
supply of electricity to their premises. On 19 June 2019, the Single Judge of the High Court allowed
the Writ Petition and directed the grant of an electricity connection to the respondent. The Division
Bench by a judgment dated 24 April 2020 dismissed the writ appeal and upheld the decision of the
Single Judge.
319. In the impugned judgment dated 24 April 2020, the High Court’s interpretation largely focused
on the phrase “any consumer” contained in Regulation 4.6.4. Under Regulation 4.6.4, a new
consumer can be given service PART G connection only if the outstanding dues against the same
premises are cleared along with a late payment surcharge. The Court referred to Isha Marbles
(supra) to hold that the definition of “consumer” contained in Section 2(15) does not include an
auction-purchaser. However, the Court held that it is possible to bring an auction-purchaser within
the ambit of Regulation 4.6.4 if: (i) the distribution licensee establishes the fact that the premises
concerned were connected to the works of the distribution licensee; (ii) for the purpose of receiving
electricity; and
(iii) in such a manner that the supply of electricity can be resumed by ‘simply putting on a switch’.
320. The appellant has drawn attention to the fact that the supply of electricity to the premises was
disconnected on 21 September 2016. Therefore, the appellant submits that on the date of the sale of
the premises to the respondent, that is 31 August 2018, the supply of electricity was disconnected for
more than 180 days. Hence, it is the appellant’s contention that Regulation 4.6.1 is applicable and
there is a deemed termination of agreement. It has been further contended that Regulation 4.6.4 has
an overriding effect as it begins with a non-obstante clause. The respondent, on the contrary, has
argued that Regulation 3.4.2 would be applicable in the present case. It has been argued that
Regulation 4.6.4, despite having a non-obstante clause, has no bearing on the operation of
Regulation 3.4.2.
K.C. Ninan vs Kerala State Electricity Board & ... on 19 May, 2023

321. The supply of electricity was disconnected on 21 September 2016. The supply stood
disconnected for more than 180 days on 14 August 2018 which was the date of auction notice and on
31 August 2018 which was the date on which PART H the premises were sold to the respondent. In
terms of Regulation 4.6.1, there was deemed termination of the agreement since the supply was
disconnected for more than 180 days. However, Regulation 4.6.4 requires “any consumer” to clear
the outstanding dues of the premises to be eligible for grant of service connection. In the present
case, the respondent cannot be considered a “consumer” unless an agreement was entered into with
the distribution licensee. This has also been reiterated in Isha Marbles (supra) in the following
words:
“62. No doubt, from the tabulated statement above set out, the auction-purchasers
came to purchase the property after disconnection but they cannot be “consumer or
occupier” within the meaning of the above provisions till a contract is entered into.”
An auction-purchaser, such as the respondent, cannot be termed as a “consumer”
unless an agreement was entered into with the distribution licensee.
Therefore, we find no fault with the reasoning of the High Court.
322. Consequently, we uphold the impugned judgment of the High Court. The appeal shall stand
dismissed.
H. Equity and Fairness
323. This Court is entrusted with the constitutional authority under Article 142 of the Constitution
to render complete justice. Where appropriate, this Court has to take recourse to its constitutional
power under Article 142 to bring about substantial justice.
324. Since the decision of this Court in Isha Marbles (supra), the law as regards the liability of the
subsequent owner for the payment of arrears of the PART H electricity dues of the previous owner
has been in flux. Petitions challenging the decisions of different Electric Utilities were filed as early
as 2001. The orders of the High Courts had the effect of either directing the Electric Utilities to grant
electricity connections to auction purchasers without insisting on payment of outstanding electricity
dues, or directing the auction purchasers to comply with the conditions of supply or Electricity
Supply Code, as the case may be. In some of the nineteen cases, this Court while granting leave
passed interim orders. The legal issue of whether electricity dues constitute a charge on the property
so far as the transferor and the transferee are concerned was referred to a larger bench by an order
of this Court way back in 2006. The litigation in this batch of cases remained pending.
325. In the specific cases before us, where this Court has upheld the validity of the subordinate
regulations (Conditions of Supply or Electricity Supply Code, as the case may be) and has held the
relevant regulation to be applicable to the factual matrix, the auction purchasers would be liable to
pay the outstanding dues of the previous consumer. On behalf of the Electric Utilities, claims have
been made for interest on such arrears.
K.C. Ninan vs Kerala State Electricity Board & ... on 19 May, 2023
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/160269658/
105
326. This Court must bear in mind the element of public interest in balancing the equities,
particularly, at this stage where more than two decades have passed in litigation since the issue first
arose. The 2003 Act was enacted to promote the development of the electricity industry, while
protecting the interest of consumers. It must be kept in mind that many of the auction-purchasers
are commercial entities who had purchased the premises for commercial ventures. Electricity PART
I being a necessity for operation of any commercial venture, denial of electricity connections to the
auction-purchasers for an indefinite period of time resulted in loss of business. The delay in the
court proceedings should not be to the further detriment of the litigants.
327. Taking all facts and circumstances into consideration, including the lapse of more than two
decades since the appeals were filed before this Court and the equities arising in favour of one party
or the other, we direct the Electric Utilities to waive the outstanding interest accrued on the
principal dues from the date of application for supply of electricity by the auction purchasers.
I. Conclusions
328. The conclusions are summarised below:
a. The duty to supply electricity under Section 43 of the 2003 Act is not absolute, and is subject to
the such charges and compliances stipulated by the Electric Utilities as part of the application for
supply of electricity; b. The duty to supply electricity under Section 43 is with respect to the owner
or occupier of the premises. The 2003 Act contemplates a synergy between the consumer and
premises. Under Section 43, when electricity is supplied, the owner or occupier becomes a consumer
only with respect to those particular premises for which electricity is sought and provided by the
Electric Utilities;
c. For an application to be considered as a ‘reconnection’, the applicant has to seek supply of
electricity with respect to the same premises for which electricity was already provided. Even if the
consumer is the same, but the PART I premises are different, it will be considered as a fresh
connection and not a reconnection;
d. A condition of supply enacted under Section 49 of the 1948 Act requiring the new owner of the
premises to clear the electricity arrears of the previous owner as a precondition to availing electricity
supply will have a statutory character;
e. The scope of the regulatory powers of the State Commission under Section 50 of the 2003 Act is
wide enough to stipulate conditions for recovery of electricity arrears of previous owners from new
or subsequent owners;
f. The Electricity Supply Code providing for recoupment of electricity dues of a previous consumer
from a new owner have a reasonable nexus with the objects of the 2003 Act;
g. The rule making power contained under Section 181 read with Section 50 of the 2003 Act is wide
enough to enable the regulatory commission to provide for a statutory charge in the absence of a
K.C. Ninan vs Kerala State Electricity Board & ... on 19 May, 2023
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/160269658/
106
provision in the plenary statute providing for creation of such a charge;
h. The power to initiate recovery proceedings by filing a suit against the defaulting consumer is
independent of the power to disconnect electrical supply as a means of recovery under Section 56 of
the 2003 Act; i. The implication of the expression “as is where is” basis is that every intending
bidder is put on notice that the seller does not undertake responsibility in respect of the property
offered for sale with regard to any PART I liability for the payment of dues, like service charges,
electricity dues for power connection, and taxes of the local authorities; and j. In the exercise of the
jurisdiction under Article 142 of the Constitution, the Electric Utilities have been directed in the
facts of cases before us to waive the outstanding interest accrued on the principal dues from the date
of application for supply of electricity by the auction purchasers.
329. Pending applications, if any, shall stand disposed.
