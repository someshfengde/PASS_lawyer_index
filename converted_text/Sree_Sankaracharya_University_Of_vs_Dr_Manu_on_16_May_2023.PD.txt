NAGARATHNA, J.
Leave granted.
2. The present appeal has been filed by the Appellant-University assailing the final judgment and
order dated 10th August, 2016, passed by the High Court of Kerala at Ernakulam in Writ Appeal No.
254 of 2016. By the impugned judgment, the Division Bench of the High Court dismissed the Writ
Appeal filed by the Appellant-University and confirmed the judgment of the learned Single Judge of
the High Court, dated 13th October, 2015 whereby the appellant-University was directed Signature
Not Verified to grant two advance increments to Respondent No. 1 in terms of Clause Digitally
signed by Nidhi Ahuja Date: 2023.05.16 18:26:34 IST Reason:
6.18 of the revised University Grants Commission (“UGC”) Scheme, 1998 and Government Order
dated 21st December, 1999, on his placement as a Selection Grade Lecturer.
3. Succinctly stated, the facts giving rise to the present appeal are as under:
3.1. Respondent No.1, namely, Dr. Manu joined the service of the Appellant-University on 14th July,
1999, as a Lecturer in the Hindi language department. At the time, he had previously rendered over
eleven years of service as a Lecturer of Hindi in Mahatma Gandhi Government Arts College, Mahe,
Pondicherry for the period between 23rd December, 1988 and 13th July, 1999.
3.2. By an order dated 25th November, 2004, Respondent No. 1 was placed in the senior scale w.e.f.
14th July, 1999. Further, he was granted four advance increments by virtue of Clause 6.16 of the
Sree Sankaracharya University Of ... vs Dr. Manu on 16 May, 2023
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/193091992/
1
UGC Scheme dated 21st December, 1999 which provides that candidates who hold Ph.D. degree at
the time of recruitment as lecturers would be eligible for four advance increments.
3.3. Thereafter, by an order dated 20th October, 2011, Respondent No. 1 was placed as a Selection
Grade Lecturer w.e.f. 14th July, 2000, with the notional date of placement as 22nd December, 1999
and consequently, his pay was fixed by order dated 12th January, 2012 at Rs.
46,440-9000-55,440/-. In fixing the pay, two advance increments, payable on placement of a
Lecturer holding a Ph.D. degree as a Selection Grade Lecturer, as per Clause 6.18 of the UGC
Scheme dated 21st December, 1999, were not granted.
3.4. Respondent No. 1 filed a writ petition, being W.P. (C) No. 28567 of 2012 before the High Court
of Kerala challenging the orders of the Appellant-University dated 20th October, 2011 and 12th
January, 2012, on the ground that two advance increments, payable to him on placement as a
Selection Grade Lecturer were erroneously withheld. The reliefs, inter alia, prayed for in the said
writ petition are as under:
i) To issue a direction in the nature of a writ of certiorari quashing the order dated 12th January,
2012 to the extent of denial of placement benefits from 22nd December, 1999 to 14th July, 2000.
ii) To issue a writ of mandamus commanding the Appellant-
University to grant two advance increments to Respondent No. 1, in accordance with
Clause 6.18 of the UGC Scheme dated 22nd December, 1999, at the time of his
placement in the selection grade and accordingly refix his pay with effect from 22nd
December, 1999.
iii) To issue a writ of mandamus commanding the Appellant-
University to disburse the salary and arrears payable to Respondent No. 1 from 22nd
December, 1999, i.e., the date on which he was placed in the selection grade to 14th
July, 2000.
3.5. The Appellant-University filed a counter affidavit in the said writ petition taking the stand that
Respondent No. 1 was not eligible to claim any further increments based on his Ph.D. degree, on his
placement in the selection grade in light of the Government Order, G.O. (P) No. 44/2001/H.Edn.
dated 29th March, 2001 which had clarified that teachers who had already got the benefit of
advance increments for having a Ph.D. degree, would not be eligible for advance increments at the
time of their placement in the selection grade. That since Respondent No. 1 had already been
granted four advance increments by virtue of holding a Ph.D. degree, he would not be eligible to
claim two more advance increments based on his Ph.D. degree, at the time of being placed in the
selection grade.
3.6. The learned Single Judge of the High Court partly allowed W.P. (C) No. 28567 of 2012 and
directed the Appellant-University to pay Respondent No.2 two advance increments in terms of
Sree Sankaracharya University Of ... vs Dr. Manu on 16 May, 2023
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/193091992/
2
Clause 6.18 of the Government Order dated 21st December, 1999. The other reliefs sought for by
Respondent No.1 were left open to be decided in appropriate proceedings.
3.7. The findings and reasoning of the learned Single Judge of the High Court in partly allowing the
writ petition filed by Respondent No.1, have been encapsulated as under:
i) That there was no requirement to consider the validity of the orders of the Appellant-University
dated 20th October, 2011 and 12th January, 2012. That the only question that would require
consideration is as to the entitlement of Respondent No. 1 to two advance increments which had
been denied to him only on account of the fact that a subsequent Government Order had been
passed stipulating that teachers who had already got the benefit of advance increments for having a
Ph.D. degree, would not be eligible for advance increments at the time of their placement in the
selection grade.
ii) That the subsequent Government Order dated 29th March, 2001 had modified the Government
Order dated 21st December, 1999 to the extent of stating that teachers who had already got the
benefit of advance increments for having a Ph.D. degree, would not be eligible for advance
increments at the time of their placement in the selection grade. That an amendment cannot be
stated to have retrospective effect unless it is expressly provided that it shall operate retrospectively,
vide Ex-Capt. K.C. Arora vs. State of Haryana, 1984 (3) SCC 281 (K.C. Arora). That a perusal of the
Government Order dated 29th March, 2001 would not indicate that it was meant to operate
retrospectively.
iii) That since Respondent No.1 was notionally placed in the selection grade from 22nd December,
1999, i.e., before the subsequent Government Order dated 29th March, 2001 was passed, he would
be entitled to the benefit of Clause 6.18 of the Government Order dated 21st December, 1999.
3.8. The Appellant-University challenged the judgment passed by the learned Single Judge of the
High Court by filing a writ appeal, numbered as W.A. No. 254 of 2016, before the Division Bench of
the High Court. 3.9. By the impugned judgment dated 10th August, 2016, the Division Bench of the
High Court of Kerala dismissed the said writ appeal filed by the Appellant-University and confirmed
the judgment of the learned Single Judge of the High Court, dated 13th October, 2015 whereby the
Appellant-University was directed to grant two advance increments to Respondent No.1 in terms of
Clause 6.18 of the Government Order dated 21st December, 1999.
The pertinent findings of the Division Bench of the High Court in the impugned judgment dated
10th August, 2016 have been culled out as under:
i) That admittedly, the Government, by way of the order dated 29th March, 2001 had modified the
Government Order dated 21st December, 1999 by specifying certain conditions for eligibility for
grant of advance increments on being placed in the selection grade. Simply because the order dated
29th March, 2001 had been passed when a clarification was sought as to whether teachers who had
already got the benefit of advance increments for having a Ph.D. degree, would be eligible for
advance increments at the time of their placement in the selection grade, the said order cannot be

3
termed as a clarificatory order and be made effective retrospectively.
ii) Reliance was placed on the decision of a co-ordinate Bench of the High Court in Writ Appeal (C)
No.749 of 2013 wherein the contention of the Government that a Lecturer who was already granted
advance increments at the time of her recruitment, would not be eligible for further increments on
moving to the selection grade in light of the order dated 29th March, 2001, was repelled.
iii) That the Government Order dated 29th March, 2001 could not be made applicable to
Respondent No.1 who had been placed in the selection grade notionally from 22nd December, 1999
with actual benefits accruing from 14th July, 2000.
Aggrieved by the said judgment, the present appeal has been filed by the Appellant-University.
Submissions:
4. We have heard learned Senior Counsel Sri P.V. Surendranath for the Appellant-University and Sri
Raghenth Basant, learned counsel for Respondent No. 1 and perused the material on record. 4.1. Sri
P.V. Surendranath, learned Senior Counsel appearing on behalf of the Appellant-University at the
outset submitted that the judgments of the learned Single Judge and the Division Bench of the High
Court of Kerala dated 13th October, 2015 and 10th August, 2016 respectively, were based on an
incorrect appreciation of the law and facts of the case and, therefore, deserve to be set-aside by this
Court. 4.2. It was further contended that a close reading of Clauses 6.16 to 6.19 of the Government
Order dated 21st December, 1999 would indicate that the maximum number of advance increments
that a teacher having a Ph.D. degree could avail is limited to four, under all circumstances. That is to
say that a teacher who had a Ph.D. degree at the time of recruitment as a Lecturer and had therefore
been granted four advance increments, would not be eligible for advance increments on the basis of
the Ph.D. degree on being placed in the selection grade. 4.3. Referring to the text of Clauses 6.16 to
6.19 of the said Government Order, it was contended that the said provisions do not contemplate a
double benefit by virtue of a Ph.D. qualification. That the provisions do not seek to confer the
benefit of advance increments based on a Ph.D. qualification, at the time of recruitment and also at
the time of being placed in the selection grade. That having availed the benefit of advance
increments at the time of recruitment by virtue of holding a Ph.D. qualification, a Lecturer cannot
once again claim increments based on his/her Ph.D. qualification at the time of being placed in the
selection grade.
4.4. It was contended that the subsequent Government Order dated 29th March, 2001 clarified that
teachers who had already got the benefit of advance increments for having a Ph.D. qualification,
would not be eligible for advance increments at the time of their placement in the selection grade.
That the Government Order dated 29th March, 2001 was a clarificatory order and not one that
would vest or withdraw any substantive rights. That the Government Order dated 29th March, 2001
clearly records that the same was being issued pursuant to a clarification sought with respect to the
incentives for persons possessing/acquiring Ph.D. and M.Phil. qualifications. Therefore, the said
clarification would relate back to the date on which the previous Government Order dated 21st
December, 1999 came into effect. 4.5. It was further contended that the clarificatory order dated
Sree Sankaracharya University Of ... vs Dr. Manu on 16 May, 2023
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/193091992/
4
29th March, 2001 was issued only for the purpose of removal of ambiguities in the implementation
of the earlier Government Order dated 21st December, 1999. Therefore, it is to be read as a part and
parcel of the Government Order dated 21st December, 1999 and must not be construed as a separate
order which seeks to modify or alter the rights conferred by way of the order dated 21st December,
1999. 4.6. It was submitted that when an order itself records in no unclear terms that it has been
issued as a clarification of a previous order, it must be construed as a clarification and not as an
amendment/modification. Accordingly, such an order must be made applicable retrospectively from
the date on which the order sought to be clarified came into effect.
4.7. It was next contended that since it was specifically stated in the order dated 29th March, 2001
that the same was a clarificatory order, it was needless to specify expressly that the said order would
operate retrospectively. Hence, the learned Single Judge had erred in recording a finding that since
the order dated 29th March, 2001 did not specifically state that it would operate retrospectively, the
same could not be held to have retrospective operation.
In order to buttress this contention, Sri Surendranath has placed reliance on the decisions of this
Court in Zile Singh vs. State of Haryana, (2004) 8 SCC 1; Commissioner of Income Tax, Ahmedabad
vs. Gold Coin Health Food Pvt. Ltd., (2008) 9 SCC 622 and State of Bihar vs. Ramesh Prasad Verma
(Dead) through LRs, (2017) 5 SCC 665 (Ramesh Prasad Verma) regarding the retrospective
application of a clarificatory amendment to a statute. 4.8. Reliance was placed on the decision of this
Court in S. Sundaram Pillai vs. V.R. Pattabiraman, A.I.R. 1985 SC 582 wherein this Court observed
that an explanation added to a statutory provision is not a substantive provision, but as the plain
meaning of the word itself suggests, it is merely meant to explain or clarify certain ambiguities
which may have crept into interpreting the statutory provision. In this context, it was contended
that a perusal of the order dated 29th March, 2001 would make it abundantly clear that it was meant
to clear ambiguity in the application of Clauses 6.16 to 6.19 of the order dated 21st December, 1999
and not to withdraw any substantive rights. Therefore, there would be no bar to allow the said
clarification to operate retrospectively.
With the aforesaid contentions, it was prayed that the present appeal be allowed and the judgments
of the learned Single Judge and the Division Bench of the High Court of Kerala dated 13th October,
2015 and 10th August, 2016 respectively be quashed and set aside.
5. Per contra, learned Senior Counsel, Sri Raghenth Basant, appearing on behalf of Respondent No.
1 submitted that the impugned judgment of the High Court is based on an unimpeachable
understanding of the law and facts of the present case and therefore, does not call for interference by
this Court.
5.1. It was further submitted that a conjoint reading of Clauses 6.16, 6.18 and 6.19 would reveal that
a Lecturer with a Ph.D. degree at the time of recruitment as a Lecturer would be eligible for six
advance increments, i.e., four advance increments at the time of recruitment and two additional
increments at the time of being placed in the selection grade. Further, a Lecturer who does not
possess a Ph.D. degree at the time of his recruitment, but subsequently obtains one while serving as
a Lecturer before placement in the selection grade, would be eligible for four advance increments,
Sree Sankaracharya University Of ... vs Dr. Manu on 16 May, 2023
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/193091992/

i.e., two advance increments on obtaining a Ph.D. degree and two more increments on being placed
in the selection grade.
5.2. It was further submitted that merely because increments granted at the time of recruitment as
well as those that could be availed at the time of placement in the selection grade, were all based on
the Ph.D. qualification, the former tranche of increments was not to be granted to the exclusion of
the latter. That though granted on the basis of a Ph.D. qualification, the increments were made
effective at different phases of a Lecturer’s career. Hence, Clauses 6.16, 6.18 and 6.19 could not be
construed to imply that a Lecturer who had already got the benefit of four advance increments at the
time of recruitment, would not be eligible for two more advance increments on being placed in the
selection grade.
5.3. It was contended that a reading of Clauses 6.16, 6.18 and 6.19 would not suggest that a Lecturer
who had already got the benefit of four advance increments at the time of recruitment, would not be
eligible for two more advance increments on being placed in the selection grade. Therefore, the
Government Order dated 29th March, 2001 which significantly modified/amended the meaning of
Clauses 6.16, 6.18 and 6.19, could not be stated to be a clarification and therefore made applicable
retrospectively.
5.4. Reliance was placed on the decision of this Court in K.C. Arora to contend that an amendment
cannot be stated to have retrospective effect unless it is expressly provided that it shall operate
retrospectively (or by necessary implication). That the Government Order dated 29th March, 2001
did not indicate that the same was to operate retrospectively and hence, cannot be stated to have
retrospective effect. 5.5. It was submitted that the High Court rightly held that simply because the
order dated 29th March, 2001 had been passed when a clarification was sought as to whether
teachers who had already got the benefit of advance increments for having a Ph.D. degree, would be
eligible for advance increments at the time of their placement in the selection grade, the said order
cannot be termed as a clarificatory order and be made effective retrospectively. If the order dated
29th March, 2001 is made applicable retrospectively, it would have the effect of withdrawing vested
rights of Lecturers such as Respondent No. 1 and would hence be in contravention of settled
principles of law that an amendment could not be made applicable retrospectively, if such
application would have the effect of nullifying vested rights.
With the aforesaid submissions, it was prayed that the present appeal be dismissed as being devoid
of merit and the judgments of the learned Single Judge and the Division Bench of the High Court of
Kerala dated 13th October, 2015 and 10th August, 2016 respectively be affirmed.
Points for consideration:
6. Having heard learned Senior Counsel and learned counsel for the respective parties and on
perusal of the material on record, we find that the following points would arise for our
consideration:
Sree Sankaracharya University Of ... vs Dr. Manu on 16 May, 2023
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/193091992/
6
i) Whether the High Court was right and justified in directing grant of two advance increments to
Respondent No. 1 in terms of Clause 6.18 of the Government Order dated 21st December, 1999, on
his placement as a Selection Grade Lecturer?
ii) What order?
Discussion and analysis:
7. This matter calls for a determination as to whether the 29th March, 2001 was a clarification of
Clauses 6.16 to 6.19 of the Government Order dated 21st December, 1999, or whether, it amended or
modified the same. If the subsequent Government Order is declared to be in the nature of a
clarification of the earlier order, it may be made applicable retrospectively. Conversely, if the
subsequent Government Order is held to be a modification/amendment of the earlier order, its
application would be prospective as retrospective application thereof would result in withdrawal of
vested rights which is impermissible in law and the same may also entail recoveries to be made.
7.1. For a ready reference, the relevant clauses of the Government Order bearing number G.O. (P)
No. 171/99/H.Edn. dated 21st December, 1999 have been extracted hereinunder:
“Incentives for Ph.D./M.Phil.
6.16. Four and two advance increments will be admissible to those who hold Ph.D.
and M. Phil. degrees, respectively at the time of recruitment as Lecturers. Candidates
with D.Litt./D.Sc. should be given benefit on par with Ph.D. and M.Litt. on par with
M.Phil.
6.17. One increment will be admissible to those teachers with M.Phil. who acquire
Ph.D. within two years of recruitment.
6.18. A Lecturer with Ph.D. will be eligible for two advance increments when she/he
moves into Selection Grade/Reader.
6.19. A teacher will be eligible for two advance increments as and when she/he
acquires a Ph.D.
degree in her/his service career.” 7.2. On a conjoint reading of the aforesaid Clauses of the
Government Order dated 21st December, 1999, the following aspects would emerge:
i) A Lecturer, who at the time of recruitment has a Ph.D. degree to his/her credit, would be eligible
to four increments. Such a candidate, on being placed in the Selection Grade or as a Reader, would
be eligible to two additional advance increments. Therefore, a Lecturer with a Ph.D. degree at the
time of recruitment as a Lecturer and is later placed in the selection grade would be eligible for a
total six advance increments.

ii) A Lecturer, who possesses an M.Phil. degree at the time of recruitment, would be eligible for two
increments. If such a Lecturer acquires a Ph.D. degree within two years of recruitment, he/she
would be eligible for one additional increment. On being placed in the selection grade such a
Lecturer would be eligible for two additional advance increments. Therefore, a Lecturer who
possessed an M.Phil. degree at the time of recruitment, but later acquired a Ph.D. degree and is
placed in the selection grade would be eligible for a total five advance increments.
iii) A Lecturer who possessed neither an M.Phil. degree nor a Ph.D.
degree at the time of recruitment, but acquires a Ph.D. degree during his/her career, would be
eligible for two advance increments on acquiring a Ph.D. degree. Further, on being placed in the
selection grade, such a Lecturer would be eligible for two additional advance increments. Therefore,
a Lecturer who possessed neither an M.Phil. degree nor a Ph.D. degree at the time of recruitment,
but acquires a Ph.D. degree during his/her career and is placed in the selection grade would be
eligible for a total four advance increments.
The entitlements of different categories of lecturers, as defined under the Government Order dated
21st December, 1999 has been presented in a tabular form as under:

7.3. Having discussed the import of the aforesaid Clauses of the Government Order dated 21st
December, 1999, it is necessary to examine the extent to which it was modified by way of the
subsequent Government Order dated 29th March, 2001 numbered as G.O. (P) No. 44/2001 H. Edn.
which reads as under:

read as second paper above. He has also sought some clarifications in the incentive for Ph.D/M.Phil
laid down in Cl.6.16 to 6.19 in the G.O. read as first paper above. Government have examined the
matter in detail and are pleased to order the following:
1. The ready reckoner furnished by the Accountant General, Thiruvananthapuram along with his
letter read above, for calculating the arrears of pay from 1-1-96 to 31-1-97, reckoning the first
interim relief alone, is approved by government and is appended to this Order.
2. Teachers drawing pay at 10th stage in the pre-
revised scale of Rs.3700-5700 i.e. from Rs.4825/- onwards will get their increments after one year
and not on the normal dates of their increments.
3. Teachers holding both M.Phil and Ph.D at the time of their entry in service are entitled to 4
advance increments.
4. The incentives specified in para 6.16 to 6.18 of the government order dated 21.12.99 are not
eligible simultaneously.
5.Teachers who have got the benefit of advance increments for having Ph.D will not be eligible for
advance increments at the time of their placement in the selection grade. But the teachers who got
Ph.D. subsequently and who had not got the benefit earlier will be eligible for 2 advance increments
when he/she moves into selection Grade Reader.
The date of effect of this benefit will be from 1.1.96. Those who have acquired/will acquire Ph.D. on
or after 1.1.96 will become eligible for advance increment from the date of award of Ph.D degree.

senior scale/selection grade. The advance increment will be sanctioned in the lower scale for fixing
the pay in the higher scale.
6.A teacher is not simultaneously eligible for the incentives as stated in para 6.18 and 6.19.
7. A teacher is not eligible for benefits specified both in paras 6.17 and 5.19 (should read as 6.19)

N. Chandrasekharan Nair, Principal Secretary (Higher Education)” (Underlining by us) 7.4. The
following aspects emerge on studying the Government Order dated 29th March, 2001:
i) That the said order was issued pursuant to clarifications being sought by the Accountant General,
Thiruvananthapuram, regarding the incentives under Clauses 6.16 to 6.19 of the Government Order
dated 21st December, 1999.
ii) According to the order dated 29th March, 2001, lecturers who had got the benefit of four advance
increments at the time of their recruitment, by virtue of holding a Ph.D. degree, would not be
eligible for two more increments on being placed in the selection grade. Those lecturers who
obtained a Ph.D. degree subsequent to their recruitment would be eligible for two increments on
moving to the selection grade.
iii) A Lecturer would not be simultaneously eligible for the incentives under Clause 6.16 and 6.19.
7.5. It is necessary to contrast the entitlements of different categories of lecturers on being placed in
the selection grade, under the Government Order dated 21st December, 1999, vis-à-vis, the
subsequent Government Order dated 29th March, 2001. The same is presented in a tabular form as
under:
 Qualification    of    Total   number     of      Total number of
 the Lecturer at the    advance    increments      advance
 time             of    under the Government       increments under
 recruitment            Order   dated    21st      the   Government
                        December, 1999             Order dated 29th
                                                   March, 2001
 A Lecturer, who Six advance increments            Four       advance

 the     time      of
 recruitment
 A Lecturer who Four             advance Four       advance

 degree       during
 service
7.6. As noted from the table above, a Lecturer who has a Ph.D. degree to his/her credit at the time of
recruitment was entitled to six advance increments on being placed in the selection grade, as
stipulated under Clauses 6.16 and 6.18 of the Government Order dated 21st December, 1999.
However, the number of advance increments that would accrue to such a Lecturer on being placed
in the selection grade was reduced to four, vide Government Order dated 29th March, 2001. The
Government Order dated 29th March, 2001 restricted the eligibility of lecturers to the advance
increments which would accrue on being placed in the selection grade by providing that a teacher

11
who had got the benefit of advance increments by virtue of having a Ph.D. degree at the time of
recruitment, would not be eligible for advance increments on being placed in the selection grade.
The benefit of increments on being placed in the selection grade was restricted to those lecturers
who obtained a Ph.D. degree subsequent to their recruitment. As noted above, the Government
Order dated 29th March, 2001 modifies the Government Order dated 21st December, 1999 by
providing, inter-alia, that Lecturer would not be simultaneously eligible for the incentives under
Clause 6.16 and 6.19 thereof. On a reading of the Government of Kerala’s Order dated 29th March,
2001, it is evident that teachers holding both M.Phil. degree and Ph.D. degree at the time of their
entry in service are entitled to four advance increments which is as per the Government Order dated
21st December, 1999 extracted above. However, the incentives specified in paragraphs 6.16 to 6.18
of the aforesaid Government Order are not to be given simultaneously. In other words, a teacher is
not simultaneously eligible for the incentives as stated in paragraphs 6.18 and 6.19. Similarly, a
teacher is not eligible for benefits specified in paragraphs 6.17 and 6.19 simultaneously. This would
mean that this is the only modification made to the Order dated 21st December, 1999.
It is also to be noted that the object of providing four advance increments to a Lecturer holding
Ph.D. degree and two advance increments to a Lecturer holding M.Phil. degree at the time of
recruitment as Lecturer is in recognition of the higher qualification that they possess, as ordinarily a
Lecturer must possess a post-graduation degree to be recruited as a Lecturer. Therefore, if a person
has an M.Phil. degree at the time of recruitment as a Lecturer, he or she would be entitled to two
advance increments and if any Lecturer possesses a Ph.D. degree at the time of appointment as a
Lecturer, four advance increments are admissible. This, is in contrast to, being eligible for two
advance increments when a Lecturer acquires a Ph.D. degree during the course of service/career. On
the other hand, if a Lecturer with an M.Phil. degree acquires a Ph.D. degree within two years of
recruitment would be admissible to one increment. Also, a Lecturer with Ph.D. degree would be
eligible for two advance increments when promoted as a Selection Grade Lecturer/Reader.
In fact, in the subsequent State Government Order dated 29 th March, 2001 also, paragraph 3
reiterates that teachers holding both M.Phil. degree and Ph.D. degrees at the time of their entry in
service are entitled to four advance increments which is on par with paragraph 6.16 of the
Government Order dated 21st December, 1999. Paragraphs 4 and 6 of the said Order categorically
state that the incentive specified in paragraphs 6.16 to 6.18 and paragraphs 6.18 and 6.19 of the
earlier Government Order would not be simultaneously applicable. Even paragraph 7 of the said
Order states that the teacher is not eligible for the benefits specified both in paragraphs 6.17 and
6.19 simultaneously.
8. The next aspect that requires consideration is whether such a modification could be made
applicable retrospectively., i.e., whether the Government Order dated 29th March, 2001 to the
extent that it modifies the Government Order dated 21st December, 1999 would be applicable to
those lecturers who had acquired a Ph.D. degree at the time of their recruitment, such as,
Respondent No. 1, who were placed in the selection grade before 29th March, 2001.
8.1. It is trite that any legislation or instrument having the force of law, which is clarificatory or
explanatory in nature and purport and which seeks to clear doubts or correct an obvious omission in
Sree Sankaracharya University Of ... vs Dr. Manu on 16 May, 2023

12
a statute, would generally be retrospective in operation, vide Ramesh Prasad Verma. Therefore, in
order to determine whether the Government Order dated 29th March, 2001 may be made applicable
retrospectively, it is necessary to consider whether the said order was a clarification or a substantive
amendment.
8.2. In order to effectively deal with the aspect as to retrospective operation of the Government
Order dated 29th March, 2001 it may be useful to refer to the following extract from the treatise,
Principles of Statutory Interpretation, 11th Edition (2008) by Justice G.P. Singh on the sweep of a
clarificatory/declaratory/explanatory provision:
“The presumption against retrospective operation is not applicable to declaratory
statutes. As stated in Craies and approved by the Supreme Court: For modern
purposes a declaratory Act may be defined as an Act to remove doubts existing as to
the common law, or the meaning or effect of any Statute. Such acts are usually held to
be retrospective.
[…] An explanatory Act is generally passed to supply an obvious omission or to clear up doubts as to
the meaning of the previous Act. It is well settled that if a statute is curative or merely declaratory of
the previous law, retrospective operation is generally intended. The language 'shall be deemed
always to have meant' or 'shall be deemed never to have included' is declaratory and is in plain
terms retrospective. In the absence of clear words indicating that the amending Act is declaratory, it
would not be so construed when the amended provision was clear and unambiguous. An amending
Act may be purely clarificatory to clear a meaning of a provision of the principal Act which was
already implicit. A clarificatory amendment of this nature will have retrospective effect and,
therefore, if the principal Act was existing law when the constitution came into force, the amending
Act also will be part of the existing law.” [Emphasis by us] 8.3. This Court in Commissioner of
Income Tax, Bombay vs. Podar Cement Pvt. Ltd., (1997) 226 ITR 625 (SC) noted that circumstances
under which an amendment or modification was introduced and the consequences thereof would
have to be borne in mind while deciding the issue as to whether the amendment was clarificatory or
substantive in its nature and whether it would have retrospective effect or not. 8.4. In Allied Motors
Pvt. Ltd. vs. Commissioner of Income Tax, Delhi, (1997) 224 ITR 677 (SC), this Court found that
certain unintended consequences flowed from a provision enacted by the Parliament. There was an
obvious omission. In order to cure the defect, a proviso was sought to be introduced through an
amendment. The Court held that literal construction was liable to be avoided if it defeated the
manifest object and purpose of the Act. This Court held that if the amendment was not read into the
relevant provision retrospectively, it would be impossible to reasonably interpret the said provision.
That since there was an obvious omission in the provision, an amendment was necessitated which
would clarify/declare the law retrospectively.
9. The proposition of law that a clarificatory provision may be made applicable retrospectively is so
well established that we do not wish to burden this judgment by referring to rulings in the same
vein. However, it is necessary to dilate on the role of a clarification/explanation to a statute and how
the same may be identified and distinguished from a substantive amendment.

9.1. An explanation/clarification may not expand or alter the scope of the original provision, vide
Bihta Cooperative Development Cane Marketing Union Ltd. vs. Bank of Bihar, A.I.R. 1967 SC 389.
Merely describing a provision as an “Explanation” or a “clarification” is not decisive of its true
meaning and import. On this aspect, this Court in Virtual Soft Systems Ltd. vs. Commissioner of
Income Tax, Delhi, (2007) 289 ITR 83 (SC) observed as under:
“Even if the statute does contain a statement to the effect that the amendment is
declaratory or clarificatory, that is not the end of the matter. The Court will not
regard itself as being bound by the said statement in the statute itself, but will
proceed to analyse the nature of the amendment and then conclude whether it is in
reality a clarificatory or declaratory provision or whether it is an amendment which is
intended to change the law and which applies to future periods.” This position of the
law has also been subscribed to in Union of India vs. Martin Lottery Agencies Ltd.,
(2009) 12 SCC 209 wherein it was stated that when a new concept of tax is
introduced so as to widen the net, the same cannot be said to be only clarificatory or
declaratory and therefore be made applicable retrospectively, even though such a tax
was introduced by way of an explanation to an existing provision. It was further held
that even though an explanation begins with the expression “for removal of doubts,”
so long as there was no vagueness or ambiguity in the law prior to introduction of the
explanation, the explanation could not be applied retrospectively by stating that it
was only clarificatory.
9.2. From the aforesaid authorities, the following principles could be culled out:
i) If a statute is curative or merely clarificatory of the previous law, retrospective operation thereof
may be permitted.
ii) In order for a subsequent order/provision/amendment to be considered as clarificatory of the
previous law, the pre-amended law ought to have been vague or ambiguous. It is only when it would
be impossible to reasonably interpret a provision unless an amendment is read into it, that the
amendment is considered to be a clarification or a declaration of the previous law and therefore
applied retrospectively.
iii) An explanation/clarification may not expand or alter the scope of the original provision.
iv) Merely because a provision is described as a clarification/explanation, the Court is not bound by
the said statement in the statute itself, but must proceed to analyse the nature of the amendment
and then conclude whether it is in reality a clarificatory or declaratory provision or whether it is a
substantive amendment which is intended to change the law and which would apply prospectively.
10. Applying the law as discussed hereinabove to the facts of the present case, we are of the view that
the subsequent Government Order dated 29th March, 2001 cannot be declared as a clarification and
therefore be made applicable retrospectively. The said order has substantively modified the
Government Order dated 21st December, 1999 to the extent of stating that teachers who had already

14
got the benefit of advance increments for having a Ph.D. degree, would not be eligible for advance
increments at the time of their placement in the selection grade. As noted above, the law provides
that a clarification must not have the effect of saddling any party with an unanticipated burden or
withdrawing from any party an anticipated benefit. However, the Government Order dated 29th
March, 2001 has restricted the eligibility of lecturers for advance increments at the time of
placement in the selection grade, only to those who do not have a Ph.D. degree at the time of
recruitment and subsequently acquire the same. 10.1. The purpose of the incentives in question
seems to be twofold: First, to incentivize persons with advanced educational qualifications to apply
for the post of lecturers. Second, in order to retain in the teaching profession, persons with advanced
qualifications. In order to secure the first of the aforestated objectives, Clause 6.16 of the
Government Order dated 21st December, 1999 provided for increments that would accrue on
recruitment. In order to secure the second of the aforesaid purposes, Clause 6.19 thereof provided
for incentives that would accrue at the time of placement in the selection grade. Therefore, it could
not be said that the original intention of the Government while issuing the order dated 21st
December, 1999 was that a Lecturer would not be simultaneously eligible for the incentives under
Clause 6.16 and 6.19. 10.2. Further, as evident from the tabular comparison presented hereinabove,
the number of advance increments that would accrue in favour of a Lecturer who has a Ph.D. degree
to his/her credit at the time of recruitment, was reduced by way of the Government Order dated
29th March, 2001 from six to four. Therefore, permitting retrospective application of the said order
would result in withdrawing vested rights of lecturers who had a PhD. at the time of their
recruitment and who were placed in the selection grade before 29th March, 2001 with four plus two
advance increments.
10.3. Further, merely because the subsequent Government Order has been described as a
clarification/explanation or is said to have been issued following a clarification that was sought in
that regard, the Court is not bound to accept that the said order is only clarificatory in nature. On an
analysis of the true nature and purport of the subsequent Government Order dated 29th March,
2001, we are of the view that it is not merely clarificatory, but is a substantial amendment which
seeks to withdraw the benefit of two advance increments in favour of a certain category of lecturers.
The benefit withdrawn was not anticipated under the previously existing scheme. Therefore, such an
amendment cannot be given retrospective effect.
11. For the reasons set out above, lecturers such as Respondent No. 1 who were placed in the
selection grade before 29th March, 2001 would be entitled to all the incentives stipulated in the
Government Order dated 21st December, 1999.
12. The present appeal is dismissed. The judgments of the learned Single Judge and Division Bench
of the High Court of Kerala, dated 13th October, 2015 and 10th August, 2016 respectively are
affirmed.
Parties to bear their respective costs.
