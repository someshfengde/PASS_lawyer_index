M.Y. EQBAL, J.
Aggrieved by the judgment and order dated 16th January, 2014 passed by the High Court of
Chhattisgarh in Criminal Appeal No. 2554 of 1997 affirming the judgment dated 29.11.1997 passed
by the Sixth Additional Sessions Judge, Durg, in Sessions Trial No. 342 of 1996, whereby the
appellant has been convicted under Section 376 IPC and sentenced to 7 years R.I., the
accused-appellant has preferred this appeal challenging the conviction and sentence.
2. This is a case where the prosecutrix, who is blind and an illiterate girl, was subjected to sexual
intercourse on the promise of marriage.
3. The case of the prosecution in brief is that the prosecutrix was residing with her father at Village
Nandini Khundini. Her mother had left and married somewhere else and, thereafter, the prosecutrix
was living with her three brothers Nand Kumar, Iswari and Baldau. Along with brother of
prosecutrix Iswari, the accused Tikendra was also studying. Because of the friendship, the accused
used to visit the house of the prosecutrix and was in conversation with her. It is the case of the
prosecution that when the prosecutrix used to remain alone in her house, the accused used to visit
her and expressed her that he is in love with her. Further, the case of the prosecution is that about
one year before the incident, the accused came to the house of the prosecutrix when she was alone.
Thereafter, the accused had told her that he is in love with her and will marry her and wanted to
commit sexual intercourse with her. The prosecutrix tried to avoid it since she was a blind girl, but
the prosecutrix was told by the accused that he will marry her and will give her all support and,
therefore, she submitted herself to the accused. Thereafter, the accused committed sexual
intercourse with her. It is the case of the prosecution that whenever the prosecutrix remained alone

in the house, the accused used to come and commit sexual intercourse with her. By such course of
action, when the prosecutrix became pregnant, the prosecutrix told the accused to marry her. At that
point of time, the accused stopped visiting the house of the prosecutrix. Subsequent to it, the
incident was disclosed to the father of the prosecutrix who called the meeting of the Panchayat in
the Village. In the Panchayat, the accused was also called. It is the case of the prosecution that in the
Panchayat, the accused admitted the fact that he had committed sexual intercourse with the
prosecutrix but refused to marry her and left the Panchayat. It was the specific case of prosecution
that though the prosecutrix was blind, she could recognize the accused person by his voice and by
touch.
4. It reveals that the matter was investigated by the police and the prosecutrix was also subjected to
medical examination and finally a charge- sheet was filed under Section 376 IPC. Number of
witnesses was examined from the prosecution side including the Doctor who submitted the medical
examination report (Ex.P2 and P3) and the radiologist who obtained X-Ray of the prosecutrix and
gave his report (Ex. P4) confirming the age of the prosecutrix as approximately 18 years. The
prosecutrix was also examined as PW-1, who narrated the entire incident and the manner in which
she was subjected to sexual abuse. In her evidence, she has categorically stated that she is blind but
she could recognize a person by his voice. She has also stated that the accused-appellant had told
her that he will keep her. She has further stated that the accused committed rape on her and,
thereafter, whenever she used to stay alone in the house the accused- appellant used to come and
committed sexual intercourse with her on the pretext of marriage. It has further come in evidence
that when the prosecutrix became pregnant the accused stopped visiting her house. She has further
stated that after the incident was disclosed by her the accused was called before the Panchayat.
5. The trial court after appreciating the entire evidence including the evidence of the Doctor and the
persons who attended the Panchayat and the medical reports, recorded a finding and held that the
prosecution was able to prove the guilt of the accused-appellant. Accordingly, the accused was
convicted under Section 376 IPC and was sentenced to 7 years rigorous imprisonment.
6. As against the judgment of the trial court, the appellant filed an appeal before the High Court
being Criminal Appeal No.2554 of 1997. The High Court examined the facts and re-appreciated the
entire evidence adduced from the side of the prosecution and recorded an independent finding and
affirmed the judgment of conviction passed by the trial court.
7. We have heard learned counsel for the appellant and the respondent State. We have also
meticulously examined the finding recorded by the two courts on the basis of the evidence brought
on record by the prosecution side. After giving our anxious consideration to the matter we are of the
definite view that the prosecution has been able to prove the guilt of the appellant beyond all
reasonable doubt. We, therefore, do not find any infirmity or illegality in the judgment passed by the
two courts. Hence, the judgment of conviction must sustain in law.
8. Now the question that arises for consideration is as to whether in the facts and circumstances of
the case the prosecutrix is entitled to victim compensation and, if so, to what extent? During the
course of hearing, this Court by order dated 01.07.2015 directed the learned counsel appearing for

the respondent-State to file a copy of the Victim Compensation Scheme applicable in the State of
Chhattisgarh and to inquire about the financial status of the victim, her brothers and also of the
accused-appellant. Pursuant to the aforesaid order, learned counsel for the State has filed an
additional affidavit giving details of the inquiries made to ascertain the financial status of the victim
and the accused and also has placed on record a copy of Notification/ Compensation Scheme.
9. From the inquiry, it reveals that the victim (now aged about 37 years) lives alone in Village
Nandini Kundini, District- Durg, Chhattisgarh. She is unmarried and lives in a kuccha house. She
has two brothers who lives separately from her. One of the brothers Ishwari Sahu lives in a different
village Dhour (distance 12 kms from Nandini Kundini). Another brother Baldau Sahu lives is district
Bhila (distance 22 kms from Nandini Kundini) and works as a daily-labourer. She receives a pension
of Rs.300/- per month from the State being a person with disability. She is also a BPL card holder
which entitles her 35kg rice per month at the rate of Rs.1/- per kg. and free salt. The financial status
of victim’s brothers is also not good.
10. It further reveals from the inquiry regarding financial status of the accused that the accused lives
in the same village i.e. Nandini Kundini where the victim lives. He is married and has four children.
Mother of the accused also lives with him. He has inherited about 2 acres of land being ancestral
property which is also the source of his livelihood. Further, the wife of the accused is a blue card
holder which entitles the family to receive 35 kg. rice per month at the rate of Rs.2/- per kg. The
accused lives in a pucca house.
11. Learned counsel for the State submitted that the State of Chhattisgarh has notified Victim
Compensation Scheme under Section 357-A, Cr.P.C for providing fund for the purpose of
compensation to the victim or his dependents who has have suffered loss or injury as a result of
crime and who require rehabilitation. Relevant part of the Schedule appended to the aforesaid

13. Perusal of the aforesaid victim compensation schemes of different States and the Union
Territories, it is clear that no uniform practice is being followed in providing compensation to the
rape victim for the offence and for her rehabilitation. This practice of giving different amount
ranging from Rs.20,000/- to Rs.10,00,000/- as compensation for the offence of rape under section
357A needs to be introspected by all the States and the Union Territories. They should consider and
formulate a uniform scheme specially for the rape victims in the light of the scheme framed in the
State of Goa which has decided to give compensation up to Rs.10,00,000/-.
14. While going through different schemes for relief and rehabilitation of victims of rape, we have
also come across one Scheme made by the National Commission of Women (NCW) on the direction
of this court in Delhi Domestic Working Women’s Forum vs. Union of India and Ors. [Writ Petition
(Crl) No. 362/93], whereby this Court inter alia had directed the National Commission for Women
to evolve a “scheme” so as to wipe out the tears of unfortunate victims of rape. This scheme has been
revised by the NCW on 15th April 2010. The application under this scheme will be in addition to any
application that may be made under Section 357, 357A of the Code of Criminal Procedure as
provided in paragraph 22 of the Scheme. Under this scheme maximum of Rs.3,00,000/- (Three
lakhs) can be given to the victim of the rape for relief and rehabilitation in special cases like the

present case where the offence is against an handicapped woman who required specialized
treatment and care.
15. Coming to the present case in hand, victim being physically disadvantaged, she was already in a
socially disadvantaged position which was exploited maliciously by the accused for his own ill
intentions to commit fraud upon her and rape her in the garb of promised marriage which has put
the victim in a doubly disadvantaged situation and after the waiting of many years it has worsened.
It would not be possible for the victim to approach the National Commission for Women and follow
up for relief and rehabilitation. Accordingly the victim, who has already suffered a lot since the day
of the crime till now, needs a special rehabilitation scheme.
16. Mr. Atul Jha, learned counsel appearing for the Respondent-State, on instructions received from
the Superintendent of Police, District Durg, submitted that for the rehabilitation of the victim the
Home Secretary, Department of Home has taken decision to keep the victim in Nari Niketan, to
provide her food, clothes and shelter and the monthly pension of Rs.300/- throughout her life. For
the said rehabilitation programme, the State has to incur about Rs.8,000/- to Rs.10,000/- per
month.
17. Indisputably, no amount of money can restore the dignity and confidence that the accused took
away from the victim. No amount of money can erase the trauma and grief the victim suffers. This
aid can be crucial with aftermath of crime.
18. The victim, being in a vulnerable position and who is not being taken care of by anyone and
having no family to support her either emotionally or economically, we are not ordering the
respondent-State to give her any lump sum amount as compensation for rehabilitation as she is not
in a position to keep and manage the lump sum amount. From the records, it is evident that no one
is taking care of her and she is living alone in her Village. Accordingly, we in the special facts of this
case are directing the respondent-State to pay Rs.8,000/- per month till her life time, treating the
same to be an interest fetched on a fixed deposit of Rs.10,00,000/-. By this, the State will not be
required to pay any lump sum amount to the victim and this will also be in the interest of the victim.
19. In the result, we dismiss the appeal having no merit and issue the following directions:-
1) All the States and Union Territories shall make all endeavour to formulate a uniform scheme for
providing victim compensation in respect of rape/sexual exploitation with the physically
handicapped women as required under the law taking into consideration the scheme framed by the
State of Goa for rape victim compensation;
2) So far as this case is concerned, the respondent-State shall pay a sum of Rs.8,000/- per month as
victim compensation to the victim who is physically handicapped, i.e. blind, till her life time.
