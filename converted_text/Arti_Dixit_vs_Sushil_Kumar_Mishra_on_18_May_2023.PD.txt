                                           JUDGMENT
K.M. JOSEPH, J.
1. Leave granted.
2. The Respondents No.1 to 4 obtained an ex-parte decree against the appellants. The decree was
one for ejectment and recovery of arrears of rent, taxes, damages etc. This decree was passed on
18.10.2012. The appellants filed an application under Order IX Rule 13 read with Section 151 of the
Code of Civil Procedure (hereinafter Signature Not Verified referred to as ‘CPC’) on 06.05.2014
Digitally signed by Jagdish Kumar Date: 2023.05.18 claiming 18:45:22 IST Reason: knowledge of
the Decree on execution proceeding on 05.04.2014. It was numbered as 4C. On the very same day,
an application was filed under Section 17 of the Provincial Small Cause Courts Act 1887 (hereinafter
referred to as the ‘Act’).
3. Section 17 of the Act reads as follows:
“17. Application of the Code of Civil Procedure.— (1) The procedure prescribed in the
Code of Civil Procedure, 1908 (5 of 1908), shall save in so far as is otherwise provided
by that Code or by this Act,] be the procedure followed in a Court of Small Causes, in
all suits cognizable by it and in all proceedings arising out of such suits:
Provided that an applicant for an order to set aside a decree passed ex parte or for a
review of judgment shall, at the time of presenting his application, either deposit in
the Court the amount due from him under the decree or in pursuance of the

judgment, or give such security for the performance of the decree or compliance with
the judgment as the Court may, on a previous application made by him in this behalf,
have directed.
(2) Where a person has become liable as surety under the proviso to sub-section (1),
the security may be realised in manner provided by section 145 of the Code of Civil
Procedure, 1908 (5 of 1908).” (Emphasis Supplied)
4. The relevant contents of the Application under Section 17 and the relief sought was as follows:
“3. That the applicants pray to the Hon’ble Court that it shall be necessary in the
interest of justice to grant the permission for depositing/ paying the total amount of
Rs.
98,624/- (Rupees Ninety Eight Thousand Six Hundred Twenty Four Only) including decrial
amount, compensation, incurred expenses etc., out from such amount, a sum of Rs. 12,600/-
(Rupees Twelve Thousand Six Hundred Only) have already been deposited under section 30 (1) of
Uttar Pradesh Act No. 13 of 1972 and balance amount is calculated Rs. 86,024/- (Rupees Eighty Six
Thousand Twenty Four Only), out from the same, the applicants intend to furnish the surety of a
sum of Rs. 50,000/- (Rupees Fifty Thousand Only) and deposit balance amount before Hon’ble
Court.
4. That the applicants are annexing the Tendering Application for depositing cash amount of Rs.
36,024/- (Rupees Thirty Six Thousand Twenty Four Only), it shall be appropriate in the interest of
justice to pass tender for depositing the such amount. PRAYER Therefore, it is humbly prayed to
this Hon’ble court that grant the permission for depositing/ furnishing the surety of a sum of Rs.
50,000/- (Rupees Fifty Thousand Only) by passing the annexed tender along with application in
compliance of section 17 of Provincial Small Cause Act, 1800 presented by applicants.” (Emphasis
supplied)
5. This Application came to be numbered as 8C. Subsequently, on 12.05.2014, an Application was
filed with a prayer that the security in the form of a rental shop owned by the Nagar Nigam may be
taken on record. This Application was ‘allowed’ or ‘admitted’ on 24.05.2014, a point of controversy
to be noticed and dealt with. The surety was one Abhishek Dixit (the 7th proforma respondent in
this appeal). This was the Application numbered as 14C. On 23.09.2015, the Trial Court dismissed
Application 8C filed under Section 17 of the Act. The Order, inter alia, states as follows:
“In the light of above contentions/ arguments, I carefully inspected record file and
found that the Restoration Application i.e. 08C was presented itself on 06.05.2014,
but this application was not corroborated before the then Presiding Officer, but after
submitting the application i.e. 8C, it has been submitted the application i.e. 14C
before Court, which was admitted by Court on 24.05.2015, but it was not deposited
necessary compensation with the same. Therefore, it was not remained any relevance
to again pass the order on application i.e., 08C after submitting the application i.e.,

14C. In the above circumstances, the application i.e. 08C has been fruitless as the
application i.e. 14C has already been admitted on 24.05.2014 by the then Presiding
Officer. Therefore, at this stage, it is not any relevance of application i.e., 08C and the
same is liable to be dismissed.” (Emphasis supplied)
6. This Order was challenged by the appellants by filing a Revision before the High Court. It is
relevant to notice the following part of the Order passed by the High Court:
“Heard Sri Umesh Narain Sharma, learned Senior Advocate, assisted by Sri Shailendra Kumar
learned counsel for the revisionists and Sri W.H.Khan, learned Senior Advocate assisted by Sri
Anand Srivastava learned counsel for the opposite parties. The present revision has been filed
against the order dated 23.09.2015 passed by learned Additional District Judge/Special Judge (E.C.
Act) Kanpur Nagar, in Misc. Case No. 11/74/2014 whereby application paper no. 8-C under Section
17 of the Small Causes Court Act filed by the revisionists has been rejected arising out of ex-parte
Judgement and decree dated 18.10.2013 passed in Small Causes Case No. 27 of 2012. Learned
counsel for the revisionists contends that no notice in the SCC suit was served upon the revisionists
and ex- parte order passed against the defendants- revisionists and even in execution proceedings
no notice was served and ex-parte order passed against which application under Order IX Rule 13
C.P.C.. Learned counsel further contends that application under Section 17 of Small Causes Court
Act was filed which remain pending which application was also filed within the statutory period.
Learned has next contended that again another application under the statutory period was filed
accepting the sureties which was accepted by the learned court below after one year. Thereafter
earlier application paper no.8Ga has been rejected vide order impugned which is impugned in the
present revision. Sri W.H.Khan, learned Senior Counsel assisted by Sri Anand Srivastava, learned
counsel for the opposite parties states that once the surety has been accepted, the earlier application
has become redundant which is the order impugned in the present revision, therefore no adversity
has been attended to by the revisionists. In view of the submissions made by learned counsel for the
parties this Court is of the opinion that once the surety has been accepted by the Court below as has
also been stated by Sri W.H.Khan, learned counsel for the opposite parties, the matter may be
directed to be decided expeditiously, according it is directed as such. With the aforesaid directions,
this revision stands disposed off”.
(Emphasis supplied)
7. This Order was passed on 03.12.2015. On the basis of the said order the Trial Court by Order
dated 07.12.2016, after noticing the Order of the High Court, found that the appellants have
presented the Application under Section 17 of the Act at the time of presenting the Application
under Order IX Rule 13 of the CPC, and that though the Application 8C was dismissed by Order
dated 23.09.2015 on the basis of the Application No. 14C, in view of the decision of this Court in
Kedarnath v. Mohan Lal Kesarwari and others1, the Trial Court found that the appellant had
complied with Section 17(1) of the Act in relation to depositing the decretal amount and also in view
of the High Court order about surety being ‘admitted’ it was found that the surety submitted by the
appellants was also sufficient. It further proceeded to find that service AIR 2002 SC 582 of
summons could not be inferred on the appellants. Therefore, the application under Order IX Rule

Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/79688880/

13, (4C) was allowed with cost of Rs.1500. This Order was, in turn, challenged before the Additional
District Judge, Kanpur (Urban). By Order dated 01.08.2017, the Orders dated 07.12.2016,
23.09.2015 and 04.10.2016 were ‘dismissed’ and it was found, inter alia, as follows:
“26. In the apparent view of this Court in judicial citation i.e. Kedarnath (above), the
Hon’ble Supreme Court established the principle, such principle completely clarified
in the judicial citation i.e. Rajkumar Makhija (above) by the Bench of Hon’ble High
Court. If it is any previously established legal principle contrary to above both legal
principles, in such circumstances, it cannot be given preference to established
principle in the same. It is mandatory and prior to considering the revision
application, the Learned Trial Court must satisfy by this fact that whether the above
section 17 has been complied or not? and Such kind of satisfaction cannot be left for
later stage. In the present case, it was presented the application i.e. document no.
28C under section 17 of Provincial Small Cause Act, in fact till date, it is not passed
any order on the same and on 23.09.2015 the application dismissed on the ground
that it has already been passed order on the application i.e. document no. 34C. The
application i.e. document no. 34C had been presented only with the intention that the
surety is to be taken on record, which was admitted by Court, it means the surety had
been taken on record, but this order cannot be considered that the surety was
admitted by considering/ inferring sufficient. Thereafter again, when on the direction
of Court, it was presented the applications i.e. document nos. 90C and 102C on behalf
of defendant, in such circumstances; it was not passed any appropriate order on such
applications. If it is observed in these circumstances, it is not placed any order for
admitting surety, in absence of the same, it cannot be inferred/ considered to not
comply in any condition to the provisions of section 17 of Provincial Small Cause Act,
but as the principle established by Hon’ble Supreme Court in the case of Kedarnath
that in the condition of causing delay in passing order on the part of Court, the
defendant cannot be declared guilty/ defaulter, in the present case also, this Revision
Court cannot declare guilty/ defaulter to the defendants.
27. Whether the defendant complied the provisions of section 17 of Provincial Small
Cause Court Act or not? It is the question of one fact and it can only be decided/
adjudicated by Learned Trial Court accordingly. In such circumstances, it was not in
accordance of stipulated provisions of law to admitted revision petitioner without
concrete conclusion in relation of compliance of above section 17 and the impugned
order is liable to be set aside.” (Emphasis supplied)
8. It was thereafter ordered as follows:
“The revision is admitted. The impugned order dated 07.12.2016 and orders dated
23.09.2015 and 04.10.2016 respectively are dismissed and it is direction to Learned
Trial Court that firstly, in the light of objections of plaintiff, pass the decree after
compliance of section 17 of Provincial Small Cause Act or non-compliance in relation
its report on deposited amount and presented surety i.e. document nos. 16C/36C and

thereafter pass the appropriate order in accordance of stipulated provisions of law on
hearing the parties on revision petition. In the facts and circumstances of present
case, the parties shall afford their respective incurred expenses. Return the record
file. The parties are directed to appear on 24.08.2017 before Ld. Trial Court”.
(Emphasis supplied)
9. On the basis of the aforesaid order the Trial Court by order dated 11.02.2019 rejected the
application under Section 17 dated 06.05.2014 and also the application dated 12.05.2015. The surety
provided by the appellants was also rejected. This order was confirmed by the ADJ by Order dated
26.02.2021 in revision filed by the appellants. It was found that the Order dated 01.08.2017 passed
by the ADJ was binding on the Trial Court. We notice the following reasoning:
“ … It is apparent on the basis of above whole discussion that applicant no. 3 namely
Abhishek Dixit is not owner of the land of shop, of which, it was presented the surety
of shop by the applicant no. 3 namely Abhishek Dixit on behalf of revisionists/
applicants and the ownership of above land of shop is vested in Municipal
Corporation Kanpur Metropolitan, Kanpur. Therefore, under the provisions of
section 145 of Civil Procedure Code, the surety cannot be recovered by selling the said
shop as it is vested ownership right of Municipal Corporation, Kanpur Metropolitan,
Kanpur on the said land of shop. The applicant no. 3 namely Abhishek Dixit is not
owner of said land of shop. … … In accordance of principle established by the Bench
of Hon’ble High Court in judicial citation/ judgment i.e. Rajkumar Makheja & Others
Versus M/s. S.K.S. & Company & Others, 2012 (3) A.R.C. 117, now it cannot be
granted/ extended the time limit to the revisionists for presenting surety at this stage
as now, the limitation period of presenting the surety has been ceased. In this way, it
is clear that applicants/ revisionists have completely not complied the provisions of
section 17 of Provincial Small Cause Act.”
10. The appellants thereupon filed a Writ Petition before the High Court of Allahabad by challenging
the Order dated 01.08.2017 passed by the ADJ, the Order dated 11.02.2019 passed by the Trial Court
and the order dated 26.02.2021 passed by the ADJ. Further order dated 09.03.2021 passed by the
ADJ in Execution Case, ordering the eviction of the appellants based on the ex-parte decree, was
also challenged.
11. By the impugned Order, the High Court has dismissed the said Writ Petition. It was, inter alia,
found by the High Court that no Application for dispensing with surety was filed. Rather permission
was sought for the security being given. It was further found that the requirement of Section 17 is
mandatory and filing of application without furnishing surety and making no prayer for dispensing
would be read against the appellants. It was found that only an Application (14C) was filed on
12.05.2014, wherein the only prayer was to keep the ‘Application on record’. On 24.05.2014, Order
was passed for keeping the Application on record. There was neither any prayer for accepting the
surety towards the part of the decretal amount nor any such Order was passed. The Application
(14C), it was found, was made after the filing of the Application under Order IX Rule 13 of the CPC.

The security for the amount of Rs.50,000/- was submitted on 24.05.2014. This Court in Kedarnath
(supra), it was found, has not held that where the incompetent surety had been furnished, the Court
may dispense with the same. It was also found the Judgments relied upon by the appellants would
not apply as instead of making prayer before the Trial Court to furnish appropriate security, prior to
the Order dated 23.09.2015 was passed, the appellants resorted to litigation and at no stage they
offered any surety as per law. The concession by a Counsel regarding a question of law, it was found,
was not binding on the party. This is by way of dealing with the submission of the appellants based
on the statement of the Senior Counsel for the plaintiffs, as seen reflected on the Order of the High
Court, which we have extracted.
12. We have heard Shri Pranaya Kumar Mohapatra on behalf of the appellants. We have also heard
Sh. S.R. Singh, learned Senior Counsel on behalf of the respondents.
THE CONTENTIONS OF THE APPELLANTS
13. The appellants had moved the Application under Order IX Rule 13 of the CPC as well as the
Application under Section 17 of the Act on the same day, i.e., 06.05.2014. The Trial Court did not
pass any Order on the Application under Section 17 dated 06.05.2014. The Application under
Section 17 being filed on the same day as an Application under Order IX Rule 13, was validly filed in
terms of the Judgment of this Court in Kedarnath (supra). There was a fault on the part of the Court
in not passing Order on the Application under Section 17 filed on 06.05.2014. The appellants cannot
be made to suffer on account of the fault of the Court. On 24.05.2014, the Application filed for
taking on record the security, was accepted. The prayer in the application (14C) was ‘TAKEN ON
RECORDS’. The earlier Application dated 06.05.2014, under Section 17, was pending consideration.
The security, which was accepted, was Shop No. 25. The same was allotted by the Municipal Council,
Kanpur. For the allotment, a sum of Rs.85,000/- had been received by the Local Body, which had
been deposited. Once the security was accepted, any insufficiency found after the prescribed period,
cannot be laid at the doorstep of the appellants. Reliance is placed on the Judgment of the Full
Bench of the Allahabad High Court in the case of Bhagwandas Arora v. First ADJ Rampur. Also,
reliance is placed on the decision of this Court reported in Bhagwan Dass Arora v. First Additional
District Judge, Rampur and others2. The Trial Court passed Order on security after two years, viz.,
on 29.03.2015 with the expression ‘inappropriate security’. The Trial Court (1983) 4 SCC 1 had to
give direction on sufficiency of security within the prescribed period. If that had been passed and the
Trial Court raises questions about sufficiency of the security, the appellants could not have
submitted other security or cash without the Order of the Court. Reliance is placed on the Order
dated 03.12.2015 passed by the High Court. In view of the Order passed by the High Court, in the
hierarchical system, the ADJ erred in overlooking the Order of the High Court. We are reminded
that the Order of the ADJ dated 01.08.2017 was also challenged before the High Court in the Writ
Petition. The merits of the case must be considered. THE SUBMISSIONS OF RESPONDENTS 1 TO

14. The requirements under Section 17 are mandatory. Security was not filed on 06.05.2014 but on
24.05.2014. Therefore, the mandatory condition in proviso to Section 17(1) was not complied with.
The Court should have passed an Order on the Application under Section 17(8C) dated 06.05.2014
Arti Dixit vs Sushil Kumar Mishra on 18 May, 2023
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/79688880/

indicating the nature of the security, that would be sufficient for the performance of the Decree.
However, it was contended that it is not forthcoming as to why appellants did not press the
Application under Section 17 dated 06.05.2014 and also filed other Application for security.
Therefore, the failure on the part of the Court to pass Orders on the Application dated 06.05.2014
under Section 17 could not be a factor entitling appellants to contend that in the absence of an
Order, they were prejudiced. This is for the reason that they are presumed to know, having regard to
Section 17(2) of the Act, that security must be such as may be enforceable in law. The security, which
was furnished, consisted of a shop room, which belonged to the Municipal Corporation and not to
Shri Abhishek Dixit (the surety) who was the third Writ Petitioner and who is shown as Proforma
Respondent No.7 in the Appeal. The security was not enforceable. The period of limitation for
providing security had expired. While an Application under Section 17 can be filed with application
under Order IX Rule 13, the security must be filed along with the Application. Otherwise, it may not
be possible for the Court to find whether the security, which was filed, was in conformity of the
Section 17(2) of the Act. Even assuming that the security could be furnished subsequently, the
subsequently furnished security was not enforceable in law. The Application under Order IX Rule 13
has not been rejected on the ground that security was not furnished but on the ground that the
security furnished on 12.05.2014 (Application 14C) was not a valid security. Therefore, the plea that
the appellants cannot suffer on account of the fault of the Court, does not arise.
ANALYSIS; 3 DECISIONS; KEDARNATH (SUPRA)
15. We have already set out Section 17 of the Act. It is necessary to notice that in Kedarnath (supra),
this Court, inter alia, held as follows:
“8. A bare reading of the provision shows that the legislature has chosen to couch the
language of the proviso in a mandatory form and we see no reason to interpret,
construe and hold the nature of the proviso as directory.
An application seeking to set aside an ex parte decree passed by a Court of Small Causes or for a
review of its judgment must be accompanied by a deposit in the court of the amount due from the
applicant under the decree or in pursuance of the judgment. The provision as to deposit can be
dispensed with by the court in its discretion subject to a previous application by the applicant
seeking direction of the court for leave to furnish security and the nature thereof. The proviso does
not provide for the extent of time by which such application for dispensation may be filed. We think
that it may be filed at any time up to the time of presentation of application for setting aside ex parte
decree or for review and the court may treat it as a previous application. The obligation of the
applicant is to move a previous application for dispensation. It is then for the court to make a
prompt order. The delay on the part of the court in passing an appropriate order would not be held
against the applicant because none can be made to suffer for the fault of the court.
9. In the case at hand, the application for setting aside ex parte decree was not accompanied by
deposit in the court of the amount due and payable by the applicant under the decree. The applicant
also did not move any application for dispensing with deposit and seeking leave of the court for
furnishing such security for the performance of the decree as the court may have directed. The
Arti Dixit vs Sushil Kumar Mishra on 18 May, 2023

7
application for setting aside the decree was therefore incompetent. It could not have been
entertained and allowed.
(Emphasis supplied) THE FULL BENCH IN RAM BHAROSE
16. Since the appellants have also relied upon the Judgment of the Full Bench of the High Court of
Allahabad, we deem it appropriate to advert to the same, i.e., Ram Bharose v. Ganga Singh3. The
Full Bench of the High Court was dealing with the following facts:
The Application under Order IX Rule 13 was accompanied by a security bond to cover
the decretal amount. One of the questions, which arose was, as to whether the
Application was not maintainable in as much as the direction of the Court had not
been obtained in regard to the deposit of the decretal amount or the filing of the
security in terms of the proviso to Section 17 of the Act. Three separate opinions were
pronounced. In the opinion rendered by Mukherjee, J., we consider it appropriate to
refer to the following:
“17. Now I come to consider the second point. On a plain reading of Section 17,
Provincial Small Cause Courts Act, the applicant for the setting aside of a judgment
has to do these things: To start with, he ought to apply to the Court to which he
proposes to make an application, to tell him what kind of security, in the
circumstances detailed in the applicant's application, the Court would require of him
to furnish. Usually the Court would ask for a cash security, but it may be satisfied on
the applicant's representation that a cash security may be dispensed with.
In rare cases, as in the illustration given AIR 1931 Allahabad 727 by me in my judgment in Jhabboo
Misir's case, cited below, the Court may refuse to take a cash security and may insist on other kind of
security being taken and may insist on the move-able property in dispute being itself produced.
When the Court gives its direction, namely, whether the applicant is to furnish cash security or is to
give some other kind of security, the applicant should present his application for setting aside the
decree, together with the security demanded. Then his duties are over. The security filed will then be
scrutinized by the Court, and the Court shall see whether the security is to its satisfaction. Then
'presumably a notice would go to the plaintiff to show cause why the decree should not be set aside.
This was also the view which I took in the case of Jhabboo Misir v. Howladar Tewari.
18. Although the rule (Section 17, Small Cause Court Act), requires that the security is to be
furnished at the time of presenting an application for setting an ex parte decree, it has been held in
this Court in Moti Lal Ram Chandar Das. v. Durga Prasad MANU/UP/0193/1930 : AIR1930All830
that the security may be furnished even after the application has been made provided the security is
forthcoming within the period of 30 days of limitation. To this decision I was a party. This view was
taken by other High Courts also : see V. M. Assan Mohamad Sahib v. M.E. Rahim Sahib [1920] 43
Mad. 579, Jenu Muchi v. Budhiram Muchi [1905] 32 Cal. 339 and Narain v. Pudan
MANU/OU/0001/1929. The reason of this decision is that the previously made application may be
taken as made on the date on which the security was furnished, as the period of limitation has not
Arti Dixit vs Sushil Kumar Mishra on 18 May, 2023
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/79688880/
8
yet expired, and it would be a mere formality (which may be safely dispensed with) to direct the
applicant to file a fresh application on the day when he furnishes the security.
xxx xxx xxx
20. Where an applicant, without formally applying for the Court's direction, makes an application
for setting aside an ex parte decree and furnishes security with it, and the Court directs a notice to
issue to the other side, it must be taken that the Court is cognizant of the fact that the applicant has
furnished security as required by Section 17, Small Cause Courts Act. The order that notice should
issue may be taken as an approval by the Court of the security furnished, in the circumstances
disclosed by the applicant in his application and affidavit (if any). We may also take it that, the
Court, by implication, gave the applicant a direction that he should furnish security of the kind
actually furnished by him. This is not a more attempt to get over what may be believed to be rather
hard directions of the law. If the Court instead of issuing a notice in the case just mentioned, rejects
this application because its direction has not been obtained, and if limitation has not already
expired, it would be open to the applicant to make a fresh application and to furnish such security as
the Court may direct. A party cannot suffer by the act of a Court, and therefore we must accept the
position that the Court has given the direction, according to law to the furnishing of the security
actually furnished, where the Court instead of rejecting the application of the defendant directs that
a notice should issue.
23. The conclusion that I arrive at; therefore is that the proper course is for a party to make an
application to the Court to obtain its direction as to the nature of the security, and then to apply with
the security of the nature directed by the Court for setting aside the ex parte decree. The security
furnished must comply with the directions of the Court, and the Court will see that the security is to
its satisfaction, i. e., sufficient. But where the Court adopts a security without question and directs a
notice to issue, it, by necessary implication, gives a direction that the security should be of the
nature directed by it 'and that the security furnished is sufficient to its mind.” (Emphasis supplied)
The view taken by Boys J., insofar as it is relevant, is contained in the following paragraph: “37. The
conclusion from this, then, is that no initial defects in the making of the application must be allowed
to stand in the way of the applicant getting a notice issued to the decree-holder, provided that an
application has been filed, and further that cash has been deposited, or, if the Court has so
permitted, security has been given, all before the expiry of 30 days. A reasonable and practical
interpretation of the section is therefore as follows: (1) the applicant must within 30 days file his
application either with cash or with a [statement that he is prepared to give security (and in the
latter case, he may, of course, tender the security he proposes and ask for the direction of the Court
(2) In the case where he wants to give security, if the Court refuses to direct (security, he must
deposit cash within [the 30 days, or his application will be [rejected. (3) If the Court agrees to direct
security, then (a) it will consider (the security already offered, if it has been so offered; or (b) name
security to its satisfaction which must be filed within the 30 days. (4) If the applicant does not in fact
ask for a direction or if, though the applicant does ask for a direction, the Court does not in fact give
any direction, but in fact the Court does issue notice, the Court shall be taken to have approved the
deposit of cash or the security offered as the case may be. (5) If filed within the 30 days and accepted
by the Court expressly or impliedly by the issue of notice the application is a good application,

though it will be open to the decree-holder to challenge the nature land sufficiency of the security
and to the Court under Order 9, Rule 9 to make such further conditions as it thinks fit. In the course
of the argument it has been suggested that difficulty might arise if the Court delayed in giving its
direction, or approving expressly or impliedly the security already tendered, so long that the period
of limitation had expired before the applicant had fair opportunity of complying with the direction.
It is not a case which we have now to consider, but in a suitable case it would bet open to the Court
itself to consider and exercise its inherent powers reserved to it by Section 151, Civil P.C.” (Emphasis
supplied) Chief Justice Suleman concurred with the other Judges that the Revision must be
dismissed and he, inter alia, held as follows:
“46. No doubt the language of the proviso-is very unhappy and there is some apparent inconsistency
between the expression " at the time of presenting his application " and the expression " as the Court
may direct. " If we take the two expressions literally, the two things cannot happen exactly
simultaneously. But the direction of the Court may be obtained before the application is presented
or just after presenting the application.
47. It is quite clear to me that an application cannot be presented after the prescribed period, nor
can cash or security be deposited after the expiry of that period. The Court is not given any
discretion at all to extend the time. If the security deposited within the time is discovered afterwards
to be defective or unsatisfactory in any way, the Court has no power to direct a fresh security to be
substituted for it after the expiry of the period.
52. Of course, the question whether the security is sufficient and satisfactory need not be finally
determined during the period of 30 days. Indeed, the plaintiff decree- holder may come in
afterwards and challenge its sufficiency. The mere fact that it is found afterwards that the security
was sufficient, would not make the deposit of the security within the time in any way defective.”
BHAGWANDAS (SUPRA)
17. As far as the Judgment of this Court in Bhagwandas (supra) is concerned, the relevant facts were
as follows:
A suit was decreed ex-parte on 06.08.1977. The appellant moved an Application on
the said day within the meaning of the proviso to Section 17 of the Act to permit him
to furnish such security for the performance of the decree in lieu of cash due under
the decree. On the same day, Court granted him permission subject to making a cash
deposit for part and for the balance he had to furnish the security. Thereafter, on the
31.08.1977, he moved the Application under Order IX Rule 13 to set aside the
ex-parte decree. He also deposited the cash on 31.08.1977. On the basis of a defect
pointed in the security bond on 21.09.1977, the Court directed the appellant to supply
the defect, which consisted of deficient stamp in the security bond. The appellant
complied with the said Order. It was in these facts, the Court took the view that the
Application of the appellant was wrongly rejected on the basis that there was a legal
infirmity in the bond as instead of it being stamped under the Stamp Act it was
stamped with court fee of Rs.2/.

OUR FINDINGS
18. When a Decree is passed by a Court of Small Causes ex-parte, inter alia, under the proviso to
Section 17 of the Act, the applicant, who files an Application to set aside the ex-parte Decree is
bound to do the following:
a. He must deposit in the Court, the amount due under the Decree;
b. In the alternative, he should give security for the performance of the Decree ‘on a previous
Application’ made by him in this behalf;
19. In view of the Judgment of this Court in Kedarnath (supra), the words ‘on a previous application’
in proviso to Section 17, have been understood to be an application, which may be made along with
the application under Order IX Rule 13 of the CPC. On 06.05.2014, on the same day the Court
ordered notice to be issued fixing 19.07.2014 as the date. The execution proceeding was stayed till
19.07.2014. It could indeed be said, that even notice being issued was permissible only after
compliance with the proviso to Section 17 of the Act. The appellants had filed an Application under
Order IX Rule 13 of the CPC and Section 17 of the Act, on the same day. If the Application under
Section 17 was accompanied with a cash deposit, then, the Application under Order IX Rule 13
would have been, indeed, maintainable. The controversy arises as in the Application dated
06.05.2014, filed under Section 17, the appellants sought for permission to deposit/furnish surety
for a sum of Rs.50,000/- out of a total sum of Rs.98,624/-. No order was passed on the said
Application. On 12.05.2014, appellant moved an Application (14C). Therein, the appellant sought to
furnish security in the form of a shop room of which the Proforma Respondent in this Appeal, Shri
Abhishek Dixit was the tenant, but the owner was the Municipal Corporation, Lucknow. On the said
Application, the Court passed an Order on 24.05.2014. It reads:
“Order 24.05.2014 Today application has been filed on behalf of the judgment debtor
Dr. Aarti Dikshit for taking on record surety. Order passed. Allowed”.
20. The contention of the appellants appears to be that the Application dated 06.05.2014, was in
order as it was filed along with the Application under Order IX Rule 13 and it accords with the law
laid down in Kedarnath (supra). Once such an Application is filed, it was the duty of the Court to
pass an Order. The Court according to the appellants had a duty to indicate as to whether the
Application for permission to give security was allowed and in what form the security should be
furnished. It was as no orders were passed, that the appellants on their own filed Application and
purported to furnish the security in the form of the rented shop. The High Court in its Order dated
03.12.2015, accepted the submission of the Counsel for the parties that the surety was accepted by
the Court on 25.04.2015 and the matter was directed to be decided expeditiously and on the said
basis, the Trial Court had allowed the Application under Order IX Rule 13. This order was set aside
by the ADJ by order dated 01.08.2017 on the basis that the order dated 24.05.2014 did not mean
that the security was accepted. The trial court was to consider the application dated 06.05.2014 on
its own merits. This was so ordered after finding that no order had been passed on the application
dated 12.05.2014 accepting the security. It must be noticed that the appellants did not challenge the

11
Order dated 01.08.2017. Pursuant to the Order dated 01.08.2017, the Trial Court, by Order dated
11.02.2019, did not find merit in the case of the appellants and dismissed the Application filed under
Section 17 dated 06.05.2014 as also the Application dated 12.05.2014 and rejected the surety. It is
this Order, which has been upheld again by the ADJ by Order dated 26.02.2021 and then by the
High Court, by the impugned Order.
21. On a literal interpretation of Section 17 of the Act, which contemplates the Application under
Section 17 being filed before the Application under Order IX Rule 13, whether appellants have made
out a case. The first question, which we would have to consider is, whether the Application is in
conformity with the proviso to Section 17. Did the applicant furnish any security on 06.05.2014? The
answer can only be in the negative. The appellant did not seek for dispensing with deposit as such.
[See paragraph-9 of Kedarnath (supra)]. Therefore, the appellant had not in the said sense complied
with the mandatory requirement of Section 17. Next, was the prayer, viz., the request to permit the
appellant to deposit/furnish security for a sum of Rs.50,000/- due under the Decree in consonance
with Section 17? What was the duty of the Court in the face of such prayer under Section 17? Was the
furnishing of the security consisting of the rented shop belonging to the Local Body, sufficient
compliance of Section 17? What is the effect of the application dated 12.05.2014 and the order dated
25.05.2014 on the same which is obviously after 06.05.2014 (the date of the application under Order
IX Rule 13).
22. The High Court in the impugned order finds that no application for dispensing with surety was
filed and that this will be read against the appellants. The High Court perseveres in this observation
on three occasions. We must observe that what Section 17 of the Act contemplates in the proviso is
that the applicant seeking to set aside an ex-parte decree inter alia must either make a deposit of the
amount in question or give security. What this Court in Kedarnath (Supra) laid down was that the
provision as to deposit can be dispensed with by the Court. The applicant can, in other words, seek a
dispensing with of the deposit and seek leave for furnishing such security as the Court may direct.
Therefore, the High Court was not correct in proceeding on the basis that appellants did not make
any application for dispensing with surety. No doubt, at one place, the High Court states that there
is no prayer for dispensing with the surety or the amount sought to be deposited by way of security.
The prayer of the appellants was to permit deposit/furnishing surety of Rs.50000/- which was part
of the decretal amount. This could be treated impliedly as seeking a direction within the meaning of
Section
17. An applicant could no doubt also propose the security which he wishes to give. In fact, ordinarily,
an application for dispensing with the cash deposit and for direction to furnish security should be
made prior to application under Order IX Rule 13 of CPC. On the order passed on the same, the
applicant is to comply with the same and furnish the security at the time when he files the
application under Order IX Rule 13. Since an application under Section 17 which is really required
only in the absence of the cash deposit can be filed up to the date of the application under Order IX
Rule 13 as held in Kedarnath (supra)ordinarily, the security must be made available along with such
application. There then arises the aspect that the application under Order IX Rule 13 can be filed
within 30 days as provided in Article 123 of the Limitation Act. Undoubtedly, the deposit or security
must be furnished within 30 days as held by the full Bench of the Allahabad High Court in Ram
Arti Dixit vs Sushil Kumar Mishra on 18 May, 2023

Bharose (supra). This is on the basis that the application can be made under Order IX Rule 13 upto
the 30th day but at the same time, the conditions in the proviso, namely, the deposit or the security
must be furnished at the time of presenting the application under Order IX Rule 13. But if the
application under Section 17 can be moved along with the application under Order IX Rule 13, then
if a direction is required for furnishing security and the Court grants permission and time, then it
may be possible to furnish the security only after the date of the application under Order IX Rule 13.
As held by this Court in Kedarnath (supra), the Court is expected to pass an order promptly on the
application which may be filed under Section 17 which may be of the same date as the application
under Order IX Rule 13. Any delay on the part of the Court cannot prejudice the applicant.
23. In this case, the appellants filed the application both under Section 17 of the Act and under
Order IX Rule 13 on the same day, namely, 06.05.2014. The application under Order IX Rule 13 is
premised on knowledge of the ex parte decree being obtained on 05.05.2014 in the Execution
Proceedings. There was no security offered on 06.05.2014. Though a direction as such was not
expressly sought for but permission was sought for to furnish security, it could be said that in
substance the appellants essentially sought for direction within the meaning of the proviso to
Section
17. We have already found that the High Court was in error in finding that the appellants did not
seek for dispensing with the security, and therefore, apparently holding the same against the
appellants. When the appellants sought for permission to furnish security, if the permission was
granted and a direction to furnish security was given on the same date and it had been complied
with within the time, then the appellants would have been compliant with Section 17. No orders
were passed on the application under Section 17 dated 06.05.2014. Within 6 days, on 12.05.2014,
the appellants on their own purported to furnish security. The surety was one Abhishek Dixit (the
3rd writ petitioner who is the 7th proforma respondent in the appeal). The security was however, a
shop. The shop was not owned by the surety. The Municipal Corporation, Lucknow was the owner.
The surety was a tenant. A security to be provided under Section 17 by a surety is to be enforced
under the provisions of Section 145 of the Code of Civil Procedure as contemplated in Section 17 (2)
of the Act. Section 145 of the CPC inter alia provides that the security provided by a surety can be
enforced by effecting sale of the property. The courts in this case have held that the security
provided by the appellants through the surety is not acceptable in law having regard to Section 17
(2) as the shop belonged to the Municipal Corporation, Lucknow and it could not be sold for
enforcing the surety.
24. While it is true that no order was passed on the application under Section 17 on 06.05.2014, the
fact remains that the appellants on their own furnished a surety as stated. The High Court reasons
that the security so provided was unacceptable on two grounds. Firstly, it was not furnished along
with the application under Order IX Rule 13 on 06.05.2014. Secondly, it is found that it was not
acceptable in law.
25. It is true that the High Court in the order dated 03.12.2015 proceeded to find that the “security
was accepted by the court below”. This is by way of accepting the submission of the counsel for the
plaintiffs. It was on this basis that the matter was remanded. Following the remand, the trial court
Arti Dixit vs Sushil Kumar Mishra on 18 May, 2023

13
allowed the application filed by the appellants and also the application under Order IX Rule 13. This
has been set aside as noticed by us by the ADJ and the matters stood remanded back by Order dated
01.08.2017. This order was not challenged by the appellants. It is thereafter that the courts have
concurrently found that there was non-compliance of Section 17. The earlier order of the High court
dated 03.12.2015 has been overcome by finding that there was a sweeping statement before the High
Court in the earlier round that the surety furnished had been accepted. The High Court further finds
that actually the prayer made in application dated 12.05.2014 was only to take the surety on record.
The order dated 25.04.2014 only shows that only the surety was taken on record. It is further found
that the application dated 12.05.2014 was filed after 06.05.2014 and could not be the basis for a
valid order under Section 17.
26. We are in agreement with the courts that the security furnished by the appellants in the form of
the rented shop belonging to a third party cannot be accepted as security in law. It is patent. It is not
clear from the order dated 24.05.2014 that the Court had applied its mind to the sufficiency of the
security or as to whether it was acceptable security. If security is given, which is later found to be
unacceptable even if it is within 30 days within the meaning of Article 123 of the Limitation Act,
then it would not be complying with Section 17 [see the observations of the full Bench of the
Allahabad High court in Ram Bharose (supra)].
27. While it is true that there may have been a failure on the part of the court to pass orders on the
application dated 06.05.2014 apparently, the appellants proceeded to furnish the security in this
case on 12.05.2014. Therefore, we proceed on the basis that within 30 days of the date of knowledge
of the decree, as alleged by the appellants, but after the date of the application under Order IX Rule
13, the appellants have furnished security. We are mindful of the fact that no order was passed by
the Court on 06.05.2014. Even proceeding to consider the security however we would find that it is
clearly unacceptable in law. The effect of the order of the High Court dated 03.12.2015 must be
understood with reference to the concession made by the counsel and may not withstand the
requirement of law under Section 17 of the Act being fulfilled. We cannot be unmindful of the fact
that the appellants did not challenge the order of the Additional District Judge dated 01.08.2017.
The trial Judge was bound by the same as the appellants did not challenge the order dated
01.08.2017. The fact that the appellants, after participating in the remanded proceedings mounted a
challenge in a writ to the order dated 01.08.2017 appears to us as not advancing the case of the
appellants. This is both for the reason of the belated challenge as also the nature of the earlier order
involved.
28. In the facts, having regard to the Order dated 01.08.2017 and the security being found
unacceptable, we find no merit in the appeal generated by special leave. The appeal will stand
dismissed. There shall be no order as to costs.
