THE FACTUAL PRISM:
4. The respondent No.1 had filed T.C.T.P. No. 5 of 2015 before the Revenue Court, Madurai
(hereinafter referred to as the “Revenue Court”), on 08.12.2014, against the appellants seeking their
eviction on account of not having paid the lease rent for Fasli 1419 to Fasli 1424 (corresponding to
the years 2009 to 2014) @ 10½ bags of paddy each weighing 65kgs.
5. On 04.02.2019 in I.A. No. 29 of 2015 in T.C.T.P. No. 5 of 2015, the Special Deputy Collector,
Revenue Court, ordered the appellants to pay lease rent of 31½ bags of paddy or the amount
equivalent to it, to the respondents, within two months from the receipt of the Order, failing which
eviction proceedings would be initiated against the appellants. It would be relevant to note that the
said Order was concerned with the lease rent(s) for Fasli(s) 1421, 1423 and 1424. Though legal
notices between the parties were exchanged thereafter, but the lease amount is said to have been
finally deposited by the appellants on 18.02.2021. A Memo dated 22.02.2021 was filed in the
Revenue Court.
6. The respondent no.1 then filed I.A. No. 15 of 2021 in T.C.T.P. No. 5 of 2015 before the Revenue
Court, seeking eviction of the appellants as they had failed to deliver the 31½ bags of paddy, or the
amount equivalent, towards lease rent, which was allowed vide Order dated 03.12.2021, on the
ground that the appellants did not deposit the lease rent amount within two months.
7. The appellants challenged the Order dated 03.12.2021 by way of Civil Revision Petition (NPD) No.
271 of 2022 at the Madurai Bench of the Madras High Court. The same was dismissed by the
Impugned Judgement, confirming the Order dated 03.12.2021 passed by the Special Deputy
Collector, Revenue Court, in I.A. No. 15 of 2021 in T.C.T.P. No. 5 of 2015, thus giving rise to the
present appeal. We deem it apposite to extract the short order hereunder in toto:
“To set aside the order the order passed by the Special Sub Collector, Revenue Court,
Madurai in I.A.No.15 of 2021 in T.C.T.P.No.5 of 2015 dated 03.12.2021, the revision
petitioners have filed this Civil Revision Petition before this Court.
2. Heard the learned counsel appearing for both sides and perused the materials
available on record.
3. As per order dated 04.02.2019, in I.A. No.29 of 2015 in T.C.T.P.No.5 of 2015, the
Revenue Court, Madurai has directed the revision petitioners to deposit the lease
amount for three Faslis viz., 1421, 1423 and 1424, within two months, from the date
of receipt of a copy of the order. The revision petitioners had received the order copy
on 10.10.2020. So, the revision petitioners have to pay the lease amount within trhee
months from 10.10.2020, but they had deposited lease amopunt only on 18.02.2021,
ie., beyond the time limit. The revision petitioners have stated that they have issued
notice to the respondent, but they have not deposited the lease amount within three
months from the date of receiving the order copy. Hence, on that basis the Revenue
Court has rightly directed the revision petitioners to vacate the land. This Court finds

no valid reason to allow this revision petition.
4. Accordingly, this Civil Revision Petition stands dismissed and order passed by the Special Sub
Collector, Revenue Court, Madurai in I.A. No.15 of 2021 in T.C.T.P.No.5 of 2015 dated 03.12.2021 is
hereby confirmed. No costs. Consequently, connected miscellaneous petition is closed.”
SUBMISSIONS BY THE APPELLANTS:
8. Learned counsel for the appellants submitted that they had received the Order dated 04.02.2019
only on 10.10.2020 and had sent Legal Notice to the respondent No.1 on 06.11.2020 i.e., well within
two months from the date of receipt of the Order dated 04.02.2019, (a) expressing their readiness
and willingness to pay the lease rent of 31½ bags of paddy, and (b) asking them to come with all the
legal heirs of the original lessor and collect the lease rent.
9. It was further submitted that on 11.11.2020, the respondent no.1 replied that the appellants
should come with all the five legal heirs of the cultivating tenants together and deliver the lease rent
arrears of 31½ bags of paddy to him, who would accept it after obtaining consent from the heirs of
the original lessor. Learned counsel submitted that thereafter Replication Notice dated 07.12.2020
was issued by appellant no.1.
10. Thus, the learned counsel submitted that the respondents having failed to come and accept the
lease rent arrears, the same was deposited in court on 18.02.2021 for Rs.28,563/- in the State Bank
of India Treasury of the Special Deputy Collector, Revenue Court, and a Memo dated 22.02.2021
was filed by the appellants, with the receipt of such deposit before the said Revenue Court.
11. It was submitted that only thereafter the respondents filed I.A. No. 15 of 2021 in T.C.T.P. No. 5 of
2015 before the Revenue Court, for eviction of the appellants on the ground that the lease rent of
31½ bags of paddy were not paid within the two months, as directed by Order dated 04.02.2019.
12. Learned counsel submitted that even after the appellants filed a Reply to I.A. No. 15 of 2015
explaining the entire position and denying any delay in paying the lease rent amount, the Special
Deputy Collector, Revenue Court, by Order dated 03.12.2021 in I.A. No. 15 of 2012 in T.C.T.P. No. 5
of 2015, directed that the appellants be evicted from the concerned land.
13. Learned counsel submitted that the High Court vide the Impugned Judgment dated 25.04.2022
had wrongly rejected the Civil Revision Petition and confirmed the Order dated 03.12.2021 passed
by the Special Deputy Collector, Revenue Court. It was submitted that Section 3 of the Tamil Nadu
Cultivating Tenants Protection Act, 1955 (hereinafter referred to as the “Act”) does not provide for
eviction after the deposit of the due amount(s) and in the present case, the delay, not being
inordinate, such order(s) ought not to have been passed. It was the further contention of the learned
counsel that Section 3 of the Act also does not specify delay in deposit of rent as a ground for
eviction.
14. It was next urged that the Order dated 04.02.2019 was received by the Appellants only on
10.10.2020 and payment was eventually made on 18.02.2021, the said period falling during the

COVID-19 pandemic, the delay was required to be condoned.
15. Learned counsel submitted that Section 4 of the Act also provides for restoration of possession of
the land on payment of any arrears of rent. SUBMISSIONS OF THE RESPONDENT NO.1:
16. Per contra, learned counsel for the respondent no.1 submitted that even as per the contention of
the appellants themselves, the copy of the Order dated 04.02.2019 was received by them on
10.10.2020 and thus, they had to comply with the same latest by 09.12.2020 i.e., within 2 months,
which, admittedly, had not been done. Further, it was submitted that the appellants, only to delay,
had sent a frivolous Legal Notice stating that all the legal heirs of the original lessor should come
together and receive rent and issue receipt, which was appropriately responded to by the respondent
no.1 on 21.12.2020, highlighting that no steps were taken by the appellants to pay the lease amount.
17. It was submitted that even on 18.02.2021, only an amount of Rs.28,563/- was deposited instead
of the total accrued amount of Rs.37,820/- and till date the remaining amount had not been
deposited. It was submitted that the appellants suppressed the factum that the respondent No.1 had,
after the passing of the Impugned Judgment, instituted Execution Proceedings No. 1 of 2022 and
E.A. No. 5 of 2022 for police protection and delivery, which was finally effected on 13.10.2022.
ANALYSIS, REASONING AND CONCLUSION:
18. Though this Court had verbally permitted filing written submissions, however, the appellants
filed written submissions totalling 16-pages (including extracts from the Act), that too without
forwarding a copy thereof to the respondents. Further, belatedly, the appellants also filed a list of
judgments, again without serving the other side.
19. Thus, this Court, ordinarily, would have rejected even considering the same, but nonetheless, in
the interest of justice, has surveyed both the written submissions and the judgments submitted,
more so for the reason that in view of the order eventually being passed by us, no prejudice is going
to be caused to the other side due to such non-supply. We shall refer to the judgments relied on by
the appellants at the appropriate place infra.
20. Having considered the matter, this Court does not find any merit in the present appeal. To begin
with, the Order dated 04.02.2019, passed by the Revenue Court, was never assailed by the
appellants herein. Thus, the relationship of the tenant-landlord is not disputed. Moreover, though
the respondent no.1 had filed the case for recovery of lease rent for Fasli(s) No. 1419 to 1424 @ 10½
bags of paddy for each year, each bag weighing 65 kgs.; ultimately the Order passed by the Revenue
Court on 04.02.2019 was in the form of a direction to the appellants to pay 31½ bags of paddy or its
equivalent amount to the respondents for Fasli(s) No. 1421, 1423 and 1424. As noted above, the
substantive Order dated 04.02.2019, having never been assailed, has attained finality. Even upon
receiving copy of the Order dated 04.02.2019 on 10.10.2020, compliance was not made within two
months i.e., by 09.12.2020.

21. At this juncture, the Court would pause to indicate that merely by the appellants sending a Legal
Notice on 06.11.2020, calling upon the respondent no.1 to come and collect the rent would not, ipso
facto, discharge their onus, in law, to pay. The appellants could not have called upon the
respondents via a Legal Notice to come and collect the rent as, simply stated, they were obliged in
law, having not assailed the Order dated 04.02.2019, to pay and, if for any reason the respondent
no.1, either due to non-availability or resistance/refusal to receive/accept the same, the Order dated
04.02.2019 had clearly provided that either 31½ bags of paddy or the amount equivalent thereto
could easily have been deposited before the Revenue Court; as ultimately is stated to have been done
by the appellants, though belatedly, on 18.02.2021.

the Revenue Divisional Officer within two months from the dale of such eviction or within two

Amendment) Act, 1956 (Tamil Nadu Act XIV of 1956) for the restoration to him of the possession of

Explanation II. - Nothing in sub-sections (1), (2) and (3) shall apply to the added territories.
Explanation III. - Nothing in sub-section (1), (2) and (3) shall apply to the Kanyakumari District.”
23. The contention of the learned counsel for the appellants that Sections 3 & 4 of the Act would
come to their rescue is, in our view, erroneous, for the reason that as per Section 3 of the Act, late
payment of the rent as per the direction of the Revenue Court is clearly a valid ground for effecting
eviction. Likewise, Section 4 of the Act provides for restoration of possession only in limited cases
and that too when the default is of only one year of lease amount to be paid; whereas in the present
case, the default was for three Fasli years.
24. Reliance placed by the appellants on the judgment of this Court in S N Sundalaimuthu Chettiar v
Palaniyandavan, AIR 1966 SC 469 is misplaced, as it has no applicability to the facts of the present
case. It related to an order made under Section 3(3)
(a) of the Act by which the respondents of the said case were permitted to deposit the arrears of rent
holding them to be ‘cultivating tenant’ under Section 2(a) of the Act being covered under Section
2(ee) of the Act which defines the meaning of the expression ‘carry on personal cultivation’. The
Revenue Court’s finding of the respondents being ‘landlord’ and the appellants being ‘cultivating
tenant’ was never assailed by the appellants. Notably, the challenge by filing the Civil Revision
Petition was confined to only the Order of eviction dated 03.12.2021 and not against the original
Order i.e., the Revenue Court’s Order dated 04.02.2019, wherein it was categorically held that the
appellants are cultivating tenants and the respondents are landlords and which directed for their
eviction in the event of failure to pay the lease rent within two months.
25. Similarly, apropos the decision in G Ponniah Thevar v Nellayam Perumal Pillai, (1977) 1 SCC
500, we note that the Court had only held that cultivating tenant inducted by the person holding life
estate in that land was also entitled for protection as per the provisions of the Act, even against the
heirs of the inductor and they can only be evicted by following the procedure laid down in the Act for
reasons therein mentioned. In fact, in Paragraph No. 4, it has been noted that Section 3(2) of the Act
deals with exceptional circumstances, such as default in payment of rent in which the statutory
protection from eviction of the tenant has been lifted. In the case at hand, in fact, the procedure
contemplated under the Act has been followed. Thus, in our view, the aforesaid decision equally is
not relevant in the facts and circumstances of the present case.

26. We are afraid we cannot accord any benefit to the appellants, as sought to be taken on the basis
of the various orders passed in Suo Motu Writ Petition (C) No. 3 of 2020, starting from Order dated
23.03.2020 [(2020) 19 SCC 10] leading up to Cognizance for Extension of Limitation, In Re, (2022)
2 SCC 117, for the reason that the same relates to extension of the limitation period for filing
Petitions/ Applications/ Suits/ Appeals/ all other judicial or quasi-judicial proceedings within the
period of limitation prescribed under the general law of limitation or under any special laws (both
Central and/or State), and has absolutely no bearing insofar as the present matter is concerned.
27. The question of extension of time for compliance of the orders of court does not, in any manner,
relate to limitation. In any event, in the orders, starting from (2020) 19 SCC 10 and till (2022) 2 SCC
117 (supra) this Court was not extending, by way of overarching and/or omnibus directions, time to
comply with and/or obey judicial/court orders. Order dated 23.03.2020 in Suo Motu Writ Petition
(C) No. 3 of 2020 [(2020) 19 SCC 10] has been commented upon in S Kasi v State, (2021) 12 SCC 1,
where this Court was pleased to opine as under:
“19. The limitation for filing petitions/ applications/ suits/ appeals/ all other
proceedings was extended to obviate lawyers/litigants to come physically to file such
proceedings in respective courts/tribunals. The order was passed to protect the
litigants/lawyers whose petitions/ applications/ suits/ appeals/ all other proceedings
would become time- barred they being not able to physically come to file such
proceedings. The order was for the benefit of the litigants who have to take remedy in
law as per the applicable statute for a right. The law of limitation bars the remedy but
not the right. When this Court passed the above order for extending the limitation for
filing petitions/ applications/ suits/ appeals /all other proceedings, the order was for
the benefit of those who have to take remedy, whose remedy may be barred by time
because they were unable to come physically to file such proceedings. …” (emphasis
supplied)
28. More importantly, when the appellants themselves admit that they had given a Legal Notice on
06.11.2020 showing their readiness and willingness to pay the lease rent amount, then they cannot
take plea that they were handicapped due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Finally, they deposited
Rs.28,563/- on 18.02.2021. Ergo, it is manifest that in the instant case, there was no such special
handicap, effectuated by the pandemic, on the appellants in complying with the direction to pay
31½ bags of paddy or an amount equal thereto, which could have compelled us, if at all, to lean in
favour of the appellants.
29. Another aspect this Court would not lose sight of is the fact that the Act confers a privilege on the
cultivating tenant vis-a-vis the landlord, by which the cultivating tenant is protected from eviction
by the landlord. In order to grant such privilege, the scope of eviction of the cultivating tenant at the
behest of the landlord is circumscribed, by the Act. Hence, the court is required to ensure that even
the said limited ground(s) for eviction by the landlord of the cultivating tenant, are not frustrated by
granting some extra benefit or indulgence to the cultivating tenant.

30. In the present factual set-up, the default is of at least three years, and the time given of two
months was not per se inadequate. It is a matter of record that whatever payment was
made/deposited, without going into whether it satisfied the Order dated 04.02.2019 or not, was
made after over four months had elapsed, from the date of knowledge of the Order dated
04.02.2019, as admitted by the appellants.
31. As far as the width and amplitude of powers of the High Court under Article 227 of the
Constitution is concerned, we need only take note of, in praesenti, Estralla Rubber v Dass Estate (P)
Ltd., (2001) 8 SCC 97, and Garment Craft v Prakash Chand Goel, (2022) 4 SCC 181. In Estralla
Rubber (supra), it was stated:
“6. The scope and ambit of exercise of power and jurisdiction by a High Court under
Article 227 of the Constitution of India is examined and explained in a number of
decisions of this Court. The exercise of power under this article involves a duty on the
High Court to keep inferior courts and tribunals within the bounds of their authority
and to see that they do the duty expected or required of them in a legal manner. The
High Court is not vested with any unlimited prerogative to correct all kinds of
hardship or wrong decisions made within the limits of the jurisdiction of the
subordinate courts or tribunals. Exercise of this power and interfering with the
orders of the courts or tribunals is restricted to cases of serious dereliction of duty
and flagrant violation of fundamental principles of law or justice, where if the High
Court does not interfere, a grave injustice remains uncorrected. It is also well settled
that the High Court while acting under this article cannot exercise its power as an
appellate court or substitute its own judgment in place of that of the subordinate
court to correct an error, which is not apparent on the face of the record. The High
Court can set aside or ignore the findings of facts of an inferior court or tribunal, if
there is no evidence at all to justify or the finding is so perverse, that no reasonable
person can possibly come to such a conclusion, which the court or tribunal has come
to.
7. This Court in Ahmedabad Mfg. & Calico Ptg. Co. Ltd. v. Ram Tahel Ramnand
[(1972) 1 SCC 898 : AIR 1972 SC 1598] in AIR para 12 has stated that the power
under Article 227 of the Constitution is intended to be used sparingly and only in
appropriate cases, for the purpose of keeping the subordinate courts and tribunals
within the bounds of their authority and, not for correcting mere errors. Reference
also has been made in this regard to the case Waryam Singh v. Amarnath [AIR 1954
SC 215 : 1954 SCR 565] . This Court in Bathutmal Raichand Oswal v. Laxmibai R.
Tarte [(1975) 1 SCC 858 : AIR 1975 SC 1297] has observed that the power of
superintendence under Article 227 cannot be invoked to correct an error of fact
which only a superior court can do in exercise of its statutory power as a court of
appeal and that the High Court in exercising its jurisdiction under Article 227 cannot
convert itself into a court of appeal when the legislature has not conferred a right of
appeal. Judged by these pronounced principles, the High Court clearly exceeded its
jurisdiction under Article 227 in passing the impugned order.”

32. In the more recent Garment Craft (supra), this Court put it thus:
“15. Having heard the counsel for the parties, we are clearly of the view that the
impugned order [Prakash Chand Goel v. Garment Craft, 2019 SCC OnLine Del 11943]
is contrary to law and cannot be sustained for several reasons, but primarily for
deviation from the limited jurisdiction exercised by the High Court under Article 227
of the Constitution of India. The High Court exercising supervisory jurisdiction does
not act as a court of first appeal to reappreciate, reweigh the evidence or facts upon
which the determination under challenge is based. Supervisory jurisdiction is not to
correct every error of fact or even a legal flaw when the final finding is justified or can
be supported. The High Court is not to substitute its own decision on facts and
conclusion, for that of the inferior court or tribunal. [Celina Coelho Pereira v. Ulhas
Mahabaleshwar Kholkar, (2010) 1 SCC 217 : (2010) 1 SCC (Civ) 69] The jurisdiction
exercised is in the nature of correctional jurisdiction to set right grave dereliction of
duty or flagrant abuse, violation of fundamental principles of law or justice. The
power under Article 227 is exercised sparingly in appropriate cases, like when there is
no evidence at all to justify, or the finding is so perverse that no reasonable person
can possibly come to such a conclusion that the court or tribunal has come to. It is
axiomatic that such discretionary relief must be exercised to ensure there is no
miscarriage of justice.”
33. Although the Impugned Judgment is a short one, for the additional reasons afore-enumerated,
and keeping in view the principles enunciated in the preceding paragraphs, we do not deem it
appropriate to tinker therewith.
34. On an overall circumspection of the facts and circumstances, this Court does not find any
infirmity in Impugned Judgment, and the Orders dated 04.02.2019 and 03.12.2021 passed by the
Revenue Court. Interim order dated 31.10.2022 is vacated.
35. Accordingly, this appeal stands dismissed.
36. Any pending application(s) is/are closed.
37. Costs made easy.
