1. These civil appeals are essentially directed against the common judgment and order dated
17.02.2022, as passed by the National Company Law Appellate Tribunal, Chennai Bench,1 in a batch
of appeals in relation to the Corporate Insolvency Resolution Process2 under the Insolvency and
Bankruptcy Code, 2016,3 concerning the corporate debtor, Appu Hotels Limited4, whereby the
Appellate Tribunal has reversed the order dated 15.07.2021, as passed by the National Company
Law Tribunal, Chennai5; and while rejecting the resolution plan in question, has remanded the 1

matter to the committee of creditors6 with directions to the resolution professional7 to proceed
from the stage of publication of Form ‘G’, and invite the expression of interest8 afresh as per the
Insolvency and Bankruptcy Board of India (Insolvency Resolution Process for Corporate Persons)
Regulations, 20169.
2. In view of multiple issues raised in this batch of matters, where several steps have been taken at
different stages and different parties are having different stands and interests, we may draw a brief
outline with salient features of the factual and background aspects, in order to indicate the contours
of the forthcoming discussion.
2.1. CIRP against the corporate debtor got initiated on 05.05.2020, with the NCLT admitting an
application moved under Section 7 of the Code by one of its financial creditors, Tourism Finance
Corporation of India Limited10. In the course of proceedings, after various rounds of CoC meetings,
ultimately, the resolution plan in question was approved with 87.39 per cent. majority of voting
share on 22.01.2021. However, the CoC recommended certain changes to be made in the resolution
plan. After incorporating the changes as suggested by CoC, an application was moved before the
Adjudicating Authority (NCLT) under Section 30(6) of IBC for approval of the resolution plan.
During the proceedings before NCLT, several objections were raised by various financial creditors,
other 6 ‘CoC’, for short.
7 ‘RP’, for short.
8 ‘EOI’, for short.

resolution applicants and by the promoter and erstwhile director of corporate debtor against the
resolution plan. The promoter also stated his grievance about want of consideration of his
settlement proposal in terms of Section 12-A of the Code. However, the NCLT dismissed all the
objections and approved the resolution plan declaring it binding on the corporate debtor and other
stakeholders by the common order dated 15.07.2021.
2.2. Challenging approval of the resolution plan, several appeals were preferred before the Appellate
Tribunal (NCLAT), which were decided in the impugned common judgment and order dated
17.02.2022. The Appellate Tribunal, while upholding several of the objections against the process of
consideration of the resolution plan as also the eligibility of the successful resolution applicant,
allowed all the appeals; set aside the aforesaid order dated 15.07.2021; rejected the resolution plan
so approved by the NCLT; declared the resolution applicant ineligible in terms of Section 88 of the
Indian Trusts Act, 188211 and disqualified in terms of Section 164(2)(b) of the Companies Act,
201312; and issued directions to the resolution professional to proceed with CIRP from the stage of
publication of Form ‘G’ while inviting EOI afresh as per the CIRP Regulations. The Appellate
Tribunal also issued directions to the resolution professional to place the settlement proposal of
promoter and erstwhile director of the corporate debtor for consideration before the CoC; and if
such a proposal 11 Hereinafter also referred to as ‘the Trusts Act’. 12 Hereinafter also referred to as
‘the Companies Act’. was approved with 90 per cent. voting share of CoC, to initiate the proceeding
for withdrawal of CIRP under Section 12-A of the Code read with Regulation 30-A of the CIRP
Regulations. The Appellate Tribunal also directed that the claim of the related party
financial/operational creditors be not discriminated from that of the unrelated financial/operational
creditors.
3. The aforesaid order of NCLAT dated 17.02.2022 is under challenge before this Court by the
resolution applicant as also by the resolution professional on several counts, which could be broadly
summarised thus: First, that Regulation 35 of the CIRP Regulations does not mandate sharing of the
valuation report to the CoC and instead mandates only sharing of liquidation value. Second, that the
non-core assets were not significant in value and the valuation was communicated to and agreed
upon by the members of the CoC on 15.12.2020. Third, that non-publication of Form G on the
designated website was a mere procedural irregularity which did not prejudice interests of any of the
parties. Fourth, that the commercial wisdom of CoC was not justiciable and once the CoC had
approved the resolution plan by the requisite majority, there was very limited scope of interference
by the Courts. Fifth, that the Appellate Tribunal has overstepped its jurisdiction by declaring the
resolution applicant ineligible under Section 88 of the Trusts Act and disqualified under Section
164(2)(b) of the Companies Act. Sixth, that the claims of related party creditors cannot be treated at
par with the unrelated creditors. And seventh, that Section 12-A IBC application of the promoter
was merely a dilatory tactic and that he was not entitled to file any such application. These and other
grounds raised in these appeals have been duly contested by the respondents with their respective
stands and positions in these cases. This apart, some of the financial creditors have also moved the
applications for impleadment and have placed their respective viewpoints for consideration.

4. During the pendency of these appeals, this Court did not stay the operation of impugned order
dated 17.02.2022; and during the course of hearing of these appeals, on 07.03.2022, it was informed
by RP that pursuant to the order impugned, another meeting of CoC had been conducted on
03.03.2022. It is noticed that in the said CoC meeting held on 03.03.2022, the settlement proposal
of the promoter was voted against by 51.81% of the voting share. After conclusion of initial hearing,
while reserving judgment, this Court also took note of the fact that further meeting of CoC was
slated for 21.03.2022; and it was provided that the meetings/proceedings of the CoC could go on but
the entire process shall remain subject to the final orders to be passed in these appeals. 4.1. These
matters were again taken on board on 20.05.2022 when this Court took note of the submissions
made in another application moved by the resolution applicant for directions while pointing out that
the fresh process had been initiated by the RP by publication of Form G on 26.04.2022, inviting
fresh EOIs. Therein, the resolution applicant sought interim stay over the fresh process initiated by
RP or in the alternative, to stay the operation of the impugned order as regards declaration of his
disqualification, and to direct the RP to consider his EOI in the fresh process so initiated. This
Court, however, declined to pass any other order with reference to the fact that all the proceedings
remain subject to the final orders in these appeals.
4.2. Yet again, Civil Appeal No. 1682-1683 of 2022 was taken on the board on 17.11.2022 and
learned counsel for the parties were heard further, in view of an application moved on behalf of the
promoter and erstwhile director of the corporate debtor (IA No. 168602 of 2022), seeking
permission to bring on record subsequent events that his proposal of settlement under Section 12-A
of the Code was accepted by CoC on 12.10.2022 by 100% of the voting share, i.e., unanimously; and
the same had been placed before the Adjudicating Authority for approval. Having regard to the
events aforesaid and looking to the overall circumstances, while keeping the judgment reserved, we
requested the Adjudicating Authority to await the decision of this Court in these matters. Particulars
of the proceedings and the parties
5. In view of the issues arising for determination in these appeals, with several parties carrying
different roles, interests, and positions, worthwhile it would be to narrate at the outset, in brief, the
relevant particulars of the proceedings leading to these appeals as also the principal parties involved
herein.
6. As noticed, the CIRP against the corporate debtor got initiated on 05.05.2020, with the NCLT
admitting an application moved under Section 7 of the Code by one of its financial creditors, TFCI.
This application had been registered as IBA No. 1459 of 2019. The application for approval of the
resolution plan, moved before NCLT was registered as IA No. 150/CHE/2021 in the said IBA No.
1459 of 2019. This application and several other correlated applications were considered together
and were dealt with in the common order dated 15.07.2021 whereby, the National Company Law
Tribunal, Chennai rejected the objections and approved the resolution plan approved by the
committee of creditors. 6.1. Four separate appeals were preferred before the National Company Law
Appellate Tribunal, Chennai Bench against the aforesaid order dated 15.07.2021, being Company
Appeal (AT) (CH) (Insolvency) Nos. 164, 176, 218 and 219 of 2021. The appeals bearing numbers
164 of 2021 and 219 of 2021 were filed by the promoter and erstwhile director of corporate debtor,
respectively in challenge to the approval of resolution plan and rejection of his application for

consideration of a settlement proposal. On the other hand, the appeal bearing number 176 of 2021
was filed by one of the creditors of the corporate debtor, whose claim as financial creditor as also
operational creditor was declined in the approved resolution plan, for being a related party of the
corporate debtor. The other appeal bearing number 218 of 2021 was filed by an NRI shareholder
and erstwhile director of the corporate debtor, essentially being aggrieved by denial of any relief to
shareholders in the approved resolution plan. As noticed, these four appeals were decided together
by the NCLAT in its impugned common judgment and order dated 17.02.2022. 6.2. In the present
set of appeals in this Court against the aforesaid judgment and order dated 17.02.2022, one sub-set
is of appeals preferred by the resolution applicant which could be noticed as follows: 6.2.1. The
resolution applicant has questioned the orders passed in relation to the objections and claim of the
promoter and erstwhile director of the corporate debtor (in Appeal Nos.164 of 2021 and 219 of 2021
before NCLAT) by way of Civil Appeal Nos. 1682-1683 of 2022. The resolution applicant has further
questioned the order passed in relation to the claim of the related party (in Appeal No. 176 of 2021
before NCLAT) by way of Civil Appeal No. 1827 of 2022. Yet further, the resolution applicant has
questioned the order passed in relation to the claim of the NRI shareholder (in Appeal No. 218 of
2021 before NCLAT) by way of Civil Appeal No. 1810 of 2022.
6.3. Another sub-set is of appeals preferred by the resolution professional against the aforesaid
judgment and order dated 17.02.2022, which are as follows:
6.3.1. The resolution professional has questioned the orders passed in relation to the objections and
claim of the promoter and erstwhile director of the corporate debtor (in Appeal Nos.164 of 2021 and
219 of 2021 before NCLAT) by way of Civil Appeal Nos. 1756 of 2022 and 1807 of 2022 respectively.
The resolution professional has further questioned the order passed in relation to the claim of the
related party (in Appeal No. 176 of 2021 before NCLAT) by way of Civil Appeal No. 1757 of 2022.
Lastly, the resolution professional has questioned the order passed in relation to the claim of the
NRI shareholder (in Appeal No. 218 of 2021 before NCLAT) by way of Civil Appeal No. 1759 of 2022.
7. Now, we may take note of the relevant particulars of the principal parties involved in this
litigation. The parties could broadly be divided into three categories with reference to their
respective stands vis-à-vis the order of the Appellate Tribunal, the CIRP, and the resolution plan in
question. 7.1 The first category is of the parties who are aggrieved of the order passed by the
Appellate Tribunal on several counts and are opposing the rejection of resolution plan and remand
of the matter to CoC. They are: 7.1.1. Mr. M.K. Rajagopalan He is the resolution applicant and had
submitted the resolution plan in question, which was approved by a majority of 87.39 per cent. of
the voting share of CoC but was rejected by the Appellate Tribunal, as being in contravention of
Section 30(2) of the Code. He is appellant in Civil Appeal Nos. 1682-1683 of 2022, 1827 of 2022 and
1810 of 2022. In all the civil appeals filed by the resolution professional, he is arrayed as one of the
respondents.
7.1.2. Mr. Radhakrishnan Dharmarajan He is the resolution professional, who was appointed by the
CoC in the third meeting dated 04.09.2020 and his appointment was confirmed by the NCLT in
order dated 02.11.2020. He is appellant in Civil Appeal Nos. 1756 of 2022, 1807 of 2022, 1757 of
2022 and 1759 of 2022. In all the civil appeals filed by the resolution applicant, he is arrayed as

proforma respondent No. 2.
7.2. The second category is of the contesting respondents in this batch of appeals, who are
essentially supporting the order passed by the Appellate Tribunal. They could reasonably be
introduced as follows: 7.2.1. Dr. Periasamy Palani Gounder13 He is the promoter and erstwhile
director of the corporate debtor, Appu Hotels Limited. He is also the Chairman of Dharani Finance
Limited, the related party. He is respondent No. 1 in Civil Appeal Nos. 1682-1683 of 2022, 1756 of
2022 and 1807 of 2022.
7.2.2. Dharani Finance Limited The claim of this company, in its capacity as an operational creditor
as also a financial creditor of the corporate debtor, was rejected by NCLT for being a related party.
However, NCLAT directed the CoC to not discriminate it from unrelated financial/operational
creditors. This company is respondent No. 1 in Civil Appeal Nos. 1757 of 2022 and 1827 of 2022.
7.2.3. Dr. V. Janakiraman He is an NRI shareholder and erstwhile director of the corporate debtor
who had, along with other shareholders, invested money in the corporate debtor. He is aggrieved of
denial of the claim of shareholders in the resolution plan in question and has raised a few other
questions too alongwith the aforesaid promoter and director of the corporate debtor. He is
respondent No. 1 in Civil Appeal Nos. 1810 of 2022 and 1759 of 2022. 13 Hereinafter also referred to
as ‘the promoter’.
8. Apart from the above-mentioned parties, who are directly impleaded in these appeals, there are
other stakeholders, standing in their capacity as financial creditors and having their own role in
CIRP in question. They include:
8.1. State Bank of India14 This financial creditor of the corporate debtor with nearly 26.41% voting
share in CoC, though had earlier voted in favour of the resolution plan in question but now, looking
to the order of NCLAT relating to eligibility deficiency of the successful resolution applicant as also
the deficiency in process, is essentially supporting the rejection of resolution plan in question and
remand of matter to CoC for consideration afresh. 8.2. Edelweiss Asset Reconstruction Company
Limited along with IDBI Debentures Trusteeship Limited and Allium Finance Private Limited15
These financial creditors, with about 21.13% voting share in CoC, too had voted in favour of the
resolution plan in question. They have raised questions on the order passed by NCLAT on various
grounds. This apart, they have underscored certain other areas of concern including the amount
deposited by the resolution applicant, and have also suggested that CIRP must be allowed to go on
while leaving the promoter a right to better the resolution plan by way of a Swiss Challenge Process
only after depositing the matching amount in an escrow account prior to voting on his settlement
offer.
14 ‘SBI’, for short.
15 ‘Edelweiss & associates’, for short and collectively. 8.3. Tourism Finance Corporation of India
Limited This financial institution with 5.62% of the voting share in CoC got initiated the CIRP in
question with admission of its application under Section 7 of the Code by the NCLT on 05.05.2020
(IBA No. 1459 of 2019). The relevant factual and background aspects

9. Having taken note of the relevant particulars of the proceedings as also the principal parties
involved, we may now take note of the relevant factual and background aspects, in brief, as infra.
10. The corporate debtor, Appu Hotels Limited, is a limited company with corporate identification
number U92490TN1983PLC009942 and registered office at PGP House, No.57, Sterling Road,
Nungambakkam, Chennai - 600 034. The promoter group of the corporate debtor consists of
around one hundred non-resident investors living in the United States of America, who are said to
have invested over twenty-two million US dollars in foreign exchange in the corporate debtor. The
corporate debtor had availed project loans to construct 'Le Meridian, Coimbatore', from a
consortium of bankers led by Indian Bank. It appears that the business did not materialise as per the
estimated projections. The promoters and directors brought in nearly Rs. 100 crore as unsecured
loans over and above the cash flow to keep the corporate debtor's asset as standard. It further
appears that though the hotel was making operational profit, but the profit was insufficient to
service the loan repayment to the optimum requirement and the corporate debtor defaulted in
payment of overdues. Initiation of CIRP
11. The default on the part of corporate debtor in payment of overdues led to the application under
Section 7 of the Code for initiation of CIRP by one of its financial creditors, TFCI (who holds about
5% of the total loan amount) before the NCLT, in Application No. IBA/1459/2019. It appears that a
few propositions of One Time Settlement 16 were mooted on behalf of the corporate debtor but
without any effective result, for the corporate debtor having not been able to make payment against
the dues of the financial creditor. The NCLT observed that there being the existence of a financial
debt and there being a default on the part of the corporate debtor, the application moved by the
financial creditor was bound to be admitted and as a consequence, triggering the corporate
insolvency resolution process. Accordingly, the NCLT, by its order dated 05.05.2020, admitted this
application and appointed one Mr. Mukesh Kumar Gupta as interim resolution professional17 with
other necessary directions in the following terms: -
“12. Heard the Counsel for both the parties and perused the documents placed on
record. It Is a fact borne on record that the Corporate Debtor is unable to repay the
dues to the Financial Creditor and as such on the garb of OTS settlement the
Corporate Debtor wanted to gain time to settle of the dues to the Financial Creditor.
Further, a perusal of the record of proceedings dated 04.02.2020, also shows that the
Corporate Debtor was putting in efforts to settle of the dues of the Financial Creditor
and upon such representation being made, the Corporate Debtor was granted time to
settle the matter and the matter was finally posted to 02.03.2020 for reporting
settlement or to proceed with the matter. Thus, when the matter was taken up for
enquiry on 02.03.2020, it has been 16 ‘OTS’, for short.
17 ‘IRP’ for short.
brought to the notice of this Tribunal by the Counsel for the Financial Creditor that the Corporate
Debtor has not paid the dues of the Financial Creditor and also the Learned Counsel for the
Financial Creditor submitted that even in the affidavit filed by the Corporate Debtor, the
M.K. Rajagopalan vs Dr. Periasamy Palani Gounder on 3 May, 2023

outstanding debt has been admitted which Is owed to the Financial Creditor.
13. Thus, we are satisfied that there is a debt and default on the part of the Corporate Debtor and the
Corporate Debtor is unable to repay its dues to the Financial Creditor. It has also been consistently
held by the Hon'ble Supreme Court both in Innoventive Industries Ltd. -Vs- ICICI Bank and another
(2018) 1 SCC 407 as well as Mobilox Innovations Pvt. Ltd .. -Vs- Kirusa Software Pvt. Ltd.(2018) 1
SCC 353 after going through the Scheme of l&B Code, 2016 in depth in relation to an Application
under Section 7 filed by a Financial Creditor as compared to the one filed under Section 9 by an
Operational Creditor, in relation to a Section 7 Application where there is an existence of a 'financial
debt' and when there is a default, this Tribunal is bound to admit the Application and as a
consequence trigger the Corporate Insolvency Resolution Process (CIRP) and in relation to a Section
7 Application defence of set off or counter claim put forth by the Corporate Debtor cannot be
considered as a dispute In relation to the Financial debt and default In relation to It. In the present
case, it is clear that there is a default on the part of the Corporate Debtor.
14. Thus taking into consideration the facts and circumstances of the case as well as the position of
Law, we are of the view that this Application as flied by the Applicant - Financial Creditor is required
to be admitted under Section 7 (5) of the I&B Code, 2016.
15. The Financial Creditor has proposed the name of one MUKESH KUMAR GUPTA having
Registration Number [IBBI/IPA-001/IP- P00207/2017-18/10407] (Email id :-guptam11@
gmail.com) (Mob:- +91-9810798961) as Interim Resolution Professional (IRP) and a written
communication in the format prescribed under Form 2 of the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Board of
India (Application to Adjudicating Authority) Rules, 2016 has been filed by the proposed IRP who is
appointed as the IRP to take forward the process of Corporate Insolvency Resolution of the
Corporate Debtor. The IRP appointed shall take in this regard such other and further steps as are
required under the Statute, more specifically in terms of Section 15,17,18 of the Code and file his

their own relevance in these appeals in view of the issues raised by the parties. We may briefly take
note of the relevant steps/proceedings in their feasible chronology as follows:
12.1. Pursuant to the initiation of CIRP, IRP issued a public announcement in Form A on
08.05.2020 inviting claims from various stakeholders in the corporate debtor. Further, for
conducting the first meeting of the committee of creditors on 22.06.2020, IRP issued a notice on
18.06.2020. The said meeting was attended by all the members of the CoC including the promoter
and erstwhile director of the corporate debtor. 12.2. In the second CoC meeting conducted on
06.08.2020, the proposal of IRP in relation to information memorandum and to seek EOI by
publication of Form G was approved. Two sets of valuators were engaged as registered valuators by
IRP for all the three categories of assets, being Mr. Vikas Agarwal, Mr. Anil Kumar Saxena and Mr.
Anubhav Aggarwal (one set); and Future Value Advisors India (P) Ltd, a registered valuer entity
registered with the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Board of India18. Their fees were also approved by
the CoC.
12.3. On or about 17.08.2020, the IRP published Form G under Regulation 36A of the CIRP
Regulations, inviting expression of interest from prospective resolution applicants to submit
resolution plans. 12.4. Thereafter, in the third CoC meeting held on 04.09.2020, a resolution was
adopted to appoint Mr. Radhakrishnan Dharmarajan as the resolution professional. It was in the
same meeting that the list of fifteen EOIs received from the prospective resolution applicants and
placed by IRP, was approved by CoC. It was further informed to CoC in the said meeting by IRP that
the valuation was in process and the valuers may visit the premises of corporate debtor. On
26.09.2020, the IRP published the final list of prospective resolution applicants. It may be observed
in this regard that pursuant to publication of provisional list and upon preliminary scrutiny, thirteen
of the EOIs received were initially found eligible, of which, one had withdrawn and the other
namely, Sri Balaji Vidyapeeth (of which the successful resolution applicant was the managing
trustee), was declared ineligible since a charitable trust cannot run a profit-making entity. Hence,
the final list of eleven prospective resolution applicants was submitted before the CoC on
26.09.2020. Finally, three resolution plans 18 ‘IBBI’, for short.
were received, from Mr. Madhav Dhir, Mr. M.K. Rajagopalan (the resolution applicant – appellant
herein) and Kotak Special Solutions. 12.5. In the fourth CoC meeting held on 12.10.2020, IRP
apprised the members about the valuers visiting the properties of the corporate debtor and the
valuation being in process.
12.6. On 27.10.2020, the appellant Mr. M.K. Rajagopalan submitted his resolution plan alongwith a
demand draft in the sum of Rs. 2 crore. On 02.11.2020, the Tribunal approved the appointment of
Mr. Radhakrishnan Dharmarajan as the resolution professional.
12.7. In the fifth CoC meeting held on 12.11.2020, in the first item on the agenda, the members took
note of the appointment of Mr. Radhakrishnan Dharmarajan as the resolution professional.
Thereafter, on the second item, the CoC approved that the resolution professional shall file an
application before NCLT to seek extension of time period from 05.05.2020 to 31.10.2020 under
Section 12(2) of the Code due to Covid-19 and lockdown. In the third agenda item as regards

updates from RP and to decide on the resolution plan deadline extensions/possible reissuance of
Form G, various views were expressed by various stakeholders which culminated in the following
observations and resolution: -
“Since there were mixed views of CoC the process and way forward, RP declared that
it is the CoC who needs to decide on the commercial viability of the Resolution
Process to its best advantage, be it re issuance of the Form G and or extension of the
timelines and he will act as per the directions of the CoC.
CoC members further discussed on the Form G, receipt of Resolution Plans and any
potential requests from any of the RA’s about extension of time.
With the consensus of CoC members, it was decided that no extension of timeline for submission of
Resolution Plan should be done and the RP was directed to expedite the valuation process and check
the feasibility and viability of the Resolution Plans already submitted and present the eligible
Resolution Plans before the CoC for consideration.” 12.8. In the sixth CoC meeting held on
16.12.2020, the RP apprised the CoC members about three resolution plans having been received
out of which, the plan received from Kotak Special Solutions did not meet the criteria laid down
under the Code. The RP also informed that there had been a revision in the claims and composition
of financial creditors and as it was mandatory to give the revised details to the two resolution
applicants, the formal presentation and the resolution applicants could be called after they revise
the plans. In this meeting, the RP also apprised the CoC members about filing of time exclusion
application, which was heard on 15.12.2020 and order was reserved.
12.8.1. In the said sixth meeting, the RP also informed that he had provided the CoC members with
the fair value and liquidation value to all those who had submitted the confidential undertaking and
that that due to significant difference in the value of land and building submitted by the valuers
appointed by IRP, he shall have to appoint third valuer in accordance with Regulation 35 of the
CIRP Regulations. It was also noted that valuation of non-core assets was not done earlier but, the
third valuer appointed by RP had submitted the value of non-core assets and the same had been
shared with CoC members who had submitted their undertaking. The RP emphasized that their
value was not very significant, and it would not affect the liquidation value much. The relevant part
of the minutes of this sixth CoC meeting could be reproduced as under: -
“The RP apprised the CoC members that based on the resolution passed in 5th CoC
meeting an exclusion application along with an urgent application was filed before
the NCLT Chennai on 19.11.2020. The application was listed for hearing 15.12.2020
and the Order has been reserved.
The RP further apprised that he has provided the CoC members with the fair value
and liquidation value to all those who have submitted the confidential undertaking.
RP further apprised, that due to significant difference in the value of land and
building submitted by the valuers appointed by IRP, the RP has to appoint third
valuer in accordance with provisions of Regulation 35 of CIRP Regulations 2016.

After it was noted that valuation of non-core assets was not done, the third valuer
appointed by RP has submitted the value of non- core assets and the same has been
shared with CoC members who have submitted their undertaking. The RP
emphasized that their value is not very significant, and it will not affect the
liquidation value much. However, second valuation for the non-core assets will be
needed in order to reach a final value. RP apprised the CoC members that the valuers
appointed by IRP are based in Delhi and they are asking much higher price for
carrying the valuation of non-
core assets. Therefore, the RP will hire a local valuer keeping the cost in mind.” The RP agreed to try
and convene the next CoC meeting before Christmas eve, subject to getting the revised resolution
plans. 12.9. In the interregnum, the Tribunal, by its order dated 23.12.2020, allowed the application
moved by RP for exclusion of the period between 05.05.2020 and 31.10.2020 – 179 days – while
calculating the time for completion of CIRP of the corporate debtor; and excluded the said period
from the period of CIRP in terms of Section 12(2) of IBC because of pandemic conditions, in the
following words: -
“6. Heard the submission made by the Learned Counsel for the Applicant and
perused the records placed on file. In the facts of the present case, it is to be noted
that the CIRP in relation to the Corporate Debtor was initiated only on 05.05.2020
i.e. during the period of lockdown and as such the Applicant has sought to exclude
the period from 05.05.2020 till 31.10.2020. The Applicant placed on record the G.O.
Ms. No. 482, Revenue and Disaster Management (DM-IV) Department, Government
of Tamil Nadu dated 12.09.2020 and G.O. Ms. No. 447, Revenue and Disaster
Management (DM- IV) Department, Government of Tamil Nadu dated 30.08.2020
in order to substantiate the during such time, where the exclusion is sought for, the
lockdown was in existence in the Government of Tamil Nadu.
7. Further, it is pertinent to note here that due to Covid-19 pandemic coupled with
attendant lockdown imposed by the Central/ State Government, the Regulator viz.
IBBI has introduced an Amendment in the IBBI (Insolvency Resolution Process for
Corporate Persons) Regulations, 2016, so as to exclude the period of lockdown from
the CIRP timeline.
Regulation 40C of the IBBI (Insolvency Resolution Process for Corporate Persons)
Regulations, 2016 states as follows:
40C. Special provision relating to time-line.
Notwithstanding the time-lines contained in these regulations, but subject to the
provisions in the Code, the period of lockdown imposed by the Central Government
in the wake of Covid-19 outbreak shall not be counted for the purposes of the
time-line for any activity that could not be completed due to such lockdown, in
relation to a corporate insolvency resolution process.

8. The Learned Counsel for the Applicant submitted that he sought to exclude the period from
05.05.2020 till 31.10.2020, a total of 179 days from the period of CIRP. Thus, as to the facts of the
present case, in view of Regulation 40C of the IBBI (Insolvency Resolution Process for Corporate
Persons) Regulations, 2016 the period from 05.05.2020 till 31.10.2020 is excluded from the period
of CIRP in terms of Section 12(2) of IBC, 2016. The Applicant shall make every endeavour to
complete the CIRP in relation to the Corporate Debtor within the timelines as prescribed under the
Code. Accordingly, the application stands allowed.” 12.9.1. Two equity shareholders of the corporate
debtor challenged the aforesaid order of the Tribunal before the Appellate Tribunal in Company
Appeal (AT)(CH)(Ins.) Nos. 19 of 2021 and 20 of 2021 but, the appeals were dismissed on
05.05.2021 with the following observations19: -
“33. …..In the instant case, even though we find that Regulation 30-C could have been applied for
exclusion of 179 days on account 19 There had been other observations occurring in this judgment
and order dated 05.05.2021, which have been relied upon by NCLT while approving the resolution
plan in question and have formed a part of contentions in these appeals, as shall be noticed later. of
the unprecedented situation created by the Covid 19 pandemic and some of the Financial Creditors
opined for fresh publication of form G for the invitation of EOI. But the COC had unanimously
decided only for seeking exclusion of 179 days, i.e. from 5 May 2020 to 31 October 2020, for
completion of CIRP. But the CoC, under its commercial wisdom, did not prefer for publication of
Form-G afresh to invite Expression of Interest. Therefore such a decision of the CoC is not
justiciable.
34. In the circumstances stated above, we are of the considered opinion that the decision taken by
the Adjudicating Authority needs no interference, and both the Appeals deserves to be dismissed.”
12.10. In the seventh CoC meeting held on 29.12.2020, the RP briefly discussed the resolution plan
submitted by Mr. M.K. Rajagopalan, resolution applicant herein, as the other successful prospective
resolution applicant, Mr. Madhav Dhir, could not submit his resolution plan even after being
granted extension once, whose request for further extension was denied by CoC and it was decided
to continue with the resolution plan received from Mr. M.K. Rajagopalan. After discussing on the
resolution plan so submitted, the resolution applicant was asked to submit the revised resolution
plan after incorporating the changes suggested by the CoC members and he promised to do so by
30.12.2020. Further, the RP apprised the CoC that the third valuer as appointed had visited the
premises and conducted valuation of the non-core assets and promised to submit the draft valuation
by 30.12.2020.
12.11. In the eighth CoC meeting held on 04.01.2021, the revised resolution plan of the resolution
applicant was presented and discussed with CoC members. After long deliberation on various
aspects of the plan, it was decided that the plan could be put to vote through CoC meeting on
22.01.2021.
12.12. On 21.01.2021, just a day before the resolution plan was to be put to voting, the promoter and
erstwhile director of the corporate debtor - Dr. Periasamy Palani Gounder - submitted another OTS
proposal with reference to Section 12-A of the Code to the CoC. A so-called “Term Sheet” dated
22.01.2021 issued by Deutsche Bank was relied up as a proof of funding.

12.13. However, the CoC stuck to the agenda before it and the resolution plan submitted by the
resolution applicant - Mr. M.K. Rajagopalan - was put to vote in the ninth CoC meeting held on
22.01.2021. Though, the said plan was approved with 87.39% of the total voting share of financial
creditors present and voting in the meeting, the RP was required to send the resolution plan back to
the resolution applicant as there was dissent by some of the financial creditors and in terms of
Section 30 (2) of the Code, the amount to be paid to dissenting financial creditors shall not be less
than the amount paid to such creditors in accordance with Section 53 in the event of liquidation of
the corporate debtor. Therefore, resolution applicant was asked to further revise the resolution plan.
The relevant resolution on Agenda Item No. A.1. in the ninth CoC meeting, having its relevance to
the present matter is reproduced as under: -
“Agenda Item No. A.1 – To discuss and put to vote the Resolution Plan submitted by
Mr. M.K. Rajagopalan. The Resolution Professional apprised the CoC members that
as decided in the last CoC meeting the revised Resolution Plan submitted by Mr. M.K.
Rajagopalan will be put to physical voting for approval of the CoC members. The
Resolution Professional then asked each member of CoC present in the meeting
whether the revised Resolution Plan have their approval or not and the result of
physical voice voting is as follows:

The revised Resolution Plan was approved with 87.39% of total voting share of
Financial Creditors present and voted in the meeting. Since there was dissent by
some of the financial creditors, the Resolution Professional will send back the
Resolution Plan to the Resolution Applicant for further revision, as Section 30 (2) of
IBC 2016, provides that the amount paid to dissenting financial creditors shall not be
less than the amount paid to such creditors in accordance with Section 53 in the
event of liquidation of the Corporate Debtor.

Representative from Bank of India Tokyo emphasized that they have voted in favour considering the
fact that they will be getting their full amount. Resolution Professional assured them and other CoC
members who have voted in favour of the Resolution Plan that there will not be any changes in the
amount provided for assenting financial creditors. RP further apprised that the RA has given an
undertaking that RA will comply with Section 30(2) of IBC and there will not be any change in the
amount provided in the Resolution Plan for assenting creditors.” 12.14. On 25.01.2021, the
resolution applicant submitted the revised resolution plan incorporating the changes. He also
submitted a bank guarantee to the tune of Rs. 25 crore to the resolution professional on 01.02.2021.
Thereafter, on 03.02.2021, the resolution professional furnished Form H Compliance Certificate,
containing the details of the compliance of the resolution plan submitted by the resolution
applicant. 12.15. Though, in the chronology of events, after the aforesaid proceedings of CoC and
submission of Form H by the RP, the proceedings before the Adjudicating Authority are to be
noticed but, there remains one significant feature of this case that in the ninth meeting dated
22.01.2021, even while approving the resolution plan, the CoC asked the resolution applicant to
further revise the resolution plan, particularly in relation to the dissenting financial creditors. The
resolution applicant indeed revised the resolution plan but, such a revised plan was not placed in
CoC before presenting the matter to the Adjudicating Authority for approval. This aspect has formed
a part of contentions in these appeals and, in this regard, it has been one of the contentions on the
part of the resolution applicant that there had not been any material change in the plan and in any
case, in the later meeting of CoC, there had been a deemed post facto approval of the revised
resolution plan incorporating the changes earlier suggested by CoC. In view of the issues involved,
apt it would be that before adverting to the decision of the Adjudicating Authority, we refer to the
tenth meeting of CoC, which was held on 15.06.2021, and where the RP’s updates on the latest
developments were taken note of by CoC. The relevant part of the minutes of the tenth CoC meeting
dated 15.06.2021 read as under: -
“Agenda Item No. A 1- Update of Resolution professional on the latest developments.
• The Resolution Professional welcomed the CoC members and others to the meeting
• RP informed that post approval of the Resolution plan in the nineth CoC meeting
held on 22.01.2021, the plan was put up for revision to the RA to provide for
liquidation value where relevant based on voting and the revised Resolution plan was
received on 25/01/2021 and it was filed with the NCLT on 04.02.2021 • RP
confirmed that the CD has been kept on a going concern basis from that date,
however there are challenges from the advent of severe Covid wave from the
beginning of April 2021, which has dented the business and cash flows of the CD. •
Cash monitoring is ongoing at Chennai, Coimbatore hotels and Kumbakonam Resort.
• RP updated that the current occupancy at the Coimbatore hotel dropped to 4% which is all time
low. The turnover for the FY 2021 is about 25 crores with a negative GOP of-20%” 12.16. Before
proceeding further, another ancillary aspect may also be usefully referred to, which has also formed
a part of contentions in these appeals. It relates to another settlement proposal of the promoter. It is
noticed that while the proceedings before the Adjudicating Authority were pending, the promoter,
again, on 08.03.2021, submitted a settlement proposal to TFCI and sought consequent withdrawal

of CIRP under Section 12-A of the Code; and also submitted a ‘letter of support’ dated 14.07.2021
issued by one Saveetha Institute of Medical and Technical Sciences addressed to the CoC to
demonstrate its ability and bonafide in support of its withdrawal proposal. However, the said
support was subsequently withdrawn by Mr. Veerayan, the President of the said Saveetha Institute
of Medical and Technical Sciences.
13. Having taken note of the basic background aspects in relation to the initiation of CIRP and CoC
meetings as also the ancillary matters, we may now examine the decision of the Adjudicating
Authority leading to the approval of the resolution plan in question in necessary details. Resolution
plan approved by the Adjudicating Authority (NCLT)
14. As noticed, upon approval of the resolution plan of the resolution applicant – Mr. M.K.
Rajagopalan - by CoC with 87.39% majority of the voting share, the application bearing IA No. 150
of 2021 was filed by the resolution professional under Section 30(6) of IBC before the Adjudicating
Authority (NCLT) for approval of the resolution plan. 14.1. During the proceedings before the
Adjudicating Authority, several objections were raised by the related party, the promoter, an
unsuccessful potential resolution applicant and by some of the unsecured financial creditors.
14.2. One of the objectors to the resolution plan was the suspended director/promoter of the
resolution plan - Dr. Periasamy Palani Gounder - who filed MA No.13 of 2021 alleging procedural
irregularities in the conduct of CIRP; non-compliance of Regulation 35(1)(a) of the CIRP
Regulations, in carrying out valuation of non-core assets of corporate debtor alongwith several other
procedural errors; and for consideration of his proposal under Section 12-A of the Code with the
option to modify the same on the request of the members of CoC.
14.3. Two applications were filed by Dharani Finance Limited seeking that resolution professional
be directed to admit its claim of Rs.1,94,14,024, as operational creditor in application bearing MA
No.18 of 2021; and of Rs. Rs.4,81,62,175/- as financial creditor in application bearing MA No.48 of
2021. In both the applications, the common relief sought for was not to be treated as a related party
of the corporate debtor and not to be discriminated in the resolution plan.
15. The Adjudicating Authority dismissed the applications and allowed the resolution plan as
approved by CoC. The observations and findings of the Adjudicating Authority in its order dated
15.07.2021 had been as follows:
15.1. As regards the questions surrounding the valuation of assets and valuation reports, the
Adjudicating Authority referred to the minutes of second, third, sixth and seventh CoC meetings,
taking note of the appointment of valuers and the proceedings conducting by them. The
Adjudicating Authority further extracted Regulations 27 and 35 of the CIRP Regulations and
thereafter, recorded its satisfaction that RP had arrived at a fair value and a liquidation value based
on average of the three valuers in accordance with the requirements of Regulations. The
Adjudicating Authority also referred to the order passed by NCLAT on 05.05.2021 in Company
Appeal (AT) (Ins) Nos. 19 and 20 of 2021 and observed that the Appellate Tribunal had rendered
finding that resolution plan amount had been arrived at after following the prescribed procedure.
M.K. Rajagopalan vs Dr. Periasamy Palani Gounder on 3 May, 2023

15
Thus, the Adjudicating Authority found no error committed by IRP or RP in appointing registered
valuers and further found that there was no error in regard to the valuation submitted by those
registered valuers. Accordingly, the objections in relation to valuation were overruled. 15.1.1. The
relevant observations and findings of the Adjudicating Authority in regard to the questions
pertaining to valuation and the valuation reports, after extensive extraction of the relevant minutes
of the meetings of CoC had been as under: -
       “(I)     VALUATION REPORT:-
       ***             ***                  ***
80. In the present case, it is seen from the minutes extracted supra from the 6th CoC meeting that
RP further apprised the CoC members, that due to significant difference in the value of land and
building submitted by the valuers appointed by IRP, the RP had to appoint third valuer in
accordance with provisions of Regulation 35 of CIRP Regulations, 2016. Accordingly, the third
valuer has submitted his report before the RP and accordingly the fair value and the Liquidation
value in relation to the Corporate Debtor was arrived at by the Resolution Professional.
81. Thus, it is clear that the RP has arrived at a Fair Value and the Liquidation Value based on the
average of all the three valuers and the same has been done in accordance with Regulation 35 of the
IBBI (IRPCP) Regulations 2016. Further, the valuation certificate dated September 2019 relied on
by the promoter / suspended Director of the Corporate Debtor would be of no relevance as the same
was not done in accordance with the Regulations framed under the IBC, 2016. Also, the RP who is in
charge of the affairs of the Company Debtor once the CIRP has been triggered in relation to the
Corporate Debtor, he has to act as per the provisions of the Regulations and cannot act according to
the whims and fancies of the promoters I erstwhile directors of the Corporate Debtor. The valuation
certificate dated September 2019 relied on by the promoter I suspended Director of the Corporate
Debtor was done during pre-Covid period and the same cannot be a yardstick for the valuers who
have been appointed pursuant to the Regulations framed under the provisions of IBC, 2016. Also,
the stance of the Learned Senior Counsel for the promoter I suspended Director of the Corporate
Debtor that the CIRP was triggered during the peak of Covid would be of no relevance since at that
point of time, there was no statutory bar for this Adjudicating Authority to initiate CIRP in relation
to a Company. However, it is seen that the Application for initiation of CIRP was filed by the
Financial Creditor as early as in the year 2019 itself and during that point of time there was no cases
of Covid in India and the matter was heard in detail and the orders were reserved during March
2020. While this being the fact, the contention of the Learned Senior Counsel that only because of
Covid they were not able to settle the creditors of the Corporate Debtor, does not hold much water.
Eventhough, the valuation as arrived at by the valuers may not be acceptable to the erstwhile
promoters / Directors of the Corporate Debtor, it cannot give them a right to challenge the same
before this Adjudicating Authority on ostensible grounds.
82. Further, it is also seen that as against the order of exclusion of CIRP, passed by this Tribunal in
IA/1001/IB/2020, the erstwhile promoter or Corporate Debtor has filed an appeal before the
Hon'ble NCLAT and the Appellate Tribunal vide its order dated 05.05.2021 in Company Appeal
(AT)(Ins) No. 19 & 20 of 2021 while dealing with the valuation of the Corporate Debtor in para 14
and 15 has held as follows;

14. In response to the above, the Counsel for the Respondents contended that the
entire CIRP was conducted as per the procedure prescribed by the I&B Code. The
Appellant who is holding some equity shares in 3rd Respondent/Corporate Debtor
has come before this Appellate Tribunal by filing the present Appeal only to distract
and delay the Insolvency Resolution Process and to bring about a halt to the approval
of the Resolution Plan which the Committee of Creditors has approved with a
majority of 87.34% which is pending for approval before the Adjudicating Authority.
15. The Appellant’s contention about the valuation of the Corporate Debtor of ˆ1600
crores is unsupported by any evidence. The fact remains that the Resolution Plan
amount has arrived after following the procedure prescribed under the Code and the
Rules and Regulations made thereunder (emphasis supplied)
83. Thus, the Hon'ble NCLAT also has rendered a finding that the Resolution Plan
amount has been arrived at after following the procedure prescribed under the Code
and the Rules and Regulations made thereunder.
84. Hence for reasoning stated supra, this Adjudicating Authority finds that there was no error
committed by the IRP / RP in so far as appointing the registered valuers in relation to the Corporate
Debtor, nor there was any error on the valuation being submitted by those Registered valuers and as
a consequence thereof, the objections as raised by all the objectors in relation to the valuation of the
Corporate Debtor are overruled. Accordingly, MA/13/CHE/2021 stands dismissed.” 15.2. As regards
the question of non-consideration of the proposal given under Section 12-A IBC by the promoter,
the Adjudicating Authority referred to the proposition made by another erstwhile promoter of the
corporate debtor which was considered by CoC in its ninth meeting and it was found that even the
original applicant of CIRP, i.e., TFIC was kept in dark about such a proposal. It was also noticed that
even the proposal with the term sheet from Deutsche Bank came with a disclaimer. The
Adjudicating Authority formed the opinion that such a proposal had only been of dilatory tactics and
was mooted only at the eleventh hour to stall the resolution plan. Thus, the allegations of promoter
about non- consideration of Section 12-A application were found meritless and were rejected. The
Adjudicating Authority observed and held in this regard as under: -
“(II) ON NON-CONSIDERATION OF SEC.12A APPLICATION: -
85. The Learned Senior Counsel Mr. P.S. Raman, appearing on behalf of the erstwhile Promoter I
Director of the Corporate Debtor contended that the Resolution Professional and the CoC has not
considered the proposal as given under Section 12A of IBC, 2016. In this regard, it is pertinent to
refer to certain communications that exchanged between the parties in relation to the same. In the 9
th CoC meeting wherein the Resolution Plan was about to be put for vote, the erstwhile promoter of
the Corporate Debtor Mr. Senni Malai, requested the RP to consider an application filed under
section 12A of IBC, 2016. The record of the minutes as found in the 9th CoC meeting is extracted
hereunder;
M.K. Rajagopalan vs Dr. Periasamy Palani Gounder on 3 May, 2023
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/146393726/

" ....... As the Resolution Plan agenda was about to be put up for voting, Mr. Senni
Malai, MD of the CD and Mr. Kaliannan representing the CD, requested the RP about
a Sec 12 A, Application for withdrawal request letter, prepared by them and
circulated to the CoC about two hours before this meeting. RP Informed them, that
discussions on that can't be part of this agenda as that has not come from the
Applicant and it was not part of the agenda for this meeting. However, the Corporate
Debtor's representative insisted that this be discussed. RP said he would seek the
opinion of the Applicant, being TFCI in this case. Mr. Anoop Bali from TFCI said that
he can't opine on this letter as it is addressed to the CoC, when prompted by Mr.
Kaliannan, that this letter is being put up through TFCI, Mr. Anoop Bali said that this
can't be taken up as it has not come in the appropriate required form and he will not
be able to comment on this and requested the RP to carry on with the agenda for the
day, that of voting on the Resolution Plan. Mr. Senni Malai requested other creditors
to comment. Mr. Arun Shah of Aryav Exports said that CoC can discuss this. However
other creditors with significant voting share such as SBI, Bank of India said that we
should stick to the Agenda on hand and not deviate from the main agenda. RP then
requested the representatives from Corporate Debtor to allow for the agenda items to
go through as the majority of the CoC in favour of that and no further discussions can
be made on the letter sent to the CoC."
86. A perusal of the aforesaid minutes would show that the promoter of the Corporate Debtor has
proposed for a 12A settlement only at the 9th CoC meeting, when the Resolution Plan of the
Resolution Applicant was about to be put to vote. Further, it is also seen that the Petitioning
Creditor viz. Toursim Finance Corporation of India (TFCI) was also kept in dark about the 12A
proposal by the promoters and also flagged an issue stating that the letter has been addressed to the
CoC and not to them. However, it is seen that the said agenda of proposal to be made under Section
12A was not considered by the CoC and that they proceeded to vote for the Resolution Plan.
87. It is also seen that the Term Sheet relied on by the Learned Senior Counsel for the promoter in
order to substantiate that they have the source to settle the entire dues of the CoC, it is seen that the
said Term Sheet dated 22.01.2021 issued by Deutsche Bank would start of with a disclaimer as
follows;
"Please note that the terms set out in this Term Sheet are indicative only and do not
constitute an offer to finance the Facility. The terms and conditions of the term sheet
remain subject to the diligence, internal approvals, credit committee approval,
successful syndication, KYC and satisfactory documentation."
88. Thus, it is seen that the proposal as projected by the Learned Senior Counsel for the promoters
to be made under Section 12A, seems to be only an eye wash and a dilatory tactics to delay the
process of CIRP in relation to the Corporate Debtor and that the fact that the proposal has been
mooted only during the eleventh hour is to stall the Resolution Plan as moved by the Resolution
Applicant. Hence, for the. aforesaid reasons, the allegations of the promoters that their Section 12A
Application was not considered by the RP and the CoC do not hold any merits and stands

overruled.” 15.3. As regards the alleged procedural irregularities, the Adjudicating Authority found
the objections to be of no substance where the objectors had failed to establish any prejudice caused
to them while also observing that a statutory provision regulating a matter of practice and procedure
would generally be read as directory and not mandatory. The Adjudicating Authority observed that
the objections in relation to the procedural irregularities were not so grave as to defeat the
resolution plan. It was also observed that some of the objectors were, in fact, getting 100% of the
claimed amount in the resolution plan and it raised a suspicion if the objections by them were rather
motivated.
15.3.1. The Adjudicating Authority, in relation to the question of procedural irregularities, observed
and held as under: -
“(II) PROCEDURAL IRREGULARITIES: -
89. Another major objection in relation to the Resolution Plan was that the IRP I RP
has violated umpteen provisions of the Regulations by not adhering to the timelines
framed thereunder. In this regard, it is to be seen that the model timelines given
under the IBBI Regulations were designed by keeping into mind the CIRP period of
180 days; however in many cases the CIRP period has exceeded more than 330 days
and still continues. Thus, it cannot be gainsaid that the IRP or the RP as the case may
be has to strictly adhere to the model timelines stipulated under the Regulations. For
instance, an avoidance Application as found in Section 43, 45 and 50 can be filed
either by the RP or by the Liquidator and the model timeline prescribed under the
attendant Regulations states that the same should be filed in T+75 days. If the said
model timelines is construed as mandatory then the avoidance transactions which
entitle the Liquidator to file an Application, would be rendered as nugatory.
90. It is significant to note here that, a statutory provision regulating a matter of
practice or procedure will generally be read as directory and not mandatory. Thus,
even though the objectors to the Resolution Plan have alleged many procedural
irregularities in relation to the conduct of the proceedings in relation to the CoC;
however those objectors have miserably failed to establish as to what prejudice has
been caused to them in respect of the same. Further, a person who has been inducted
as a member of the CoC in its 6th meeting cannot be allowed to question the actions
taken by the CoC in the past meetings. However, in relation to the objections raised
by the Applicants in IA/181/CHE/2021 and IA/183/CHE/2021, this Tribunal is
unable to comprehend their objections in relation to the plan, especially when they
are getting 100% of their claim amount to be paid by the Resolution Applicant.
Hence, this raises a suspicion as to whether that these Applications as filed by the
objectors are motivated.
91. Thus, the objections as raised by the objectors in relation to the procedural irregularities in
relation to the conduct of the Corporate Insolvency Resolution Process, are not so grave in order to
defeat the Resolution Plan as filed by the Resolution Professional. Hence, for the said reasons, the
M.K. Rajagopalan vs Dr. Periasamy Palani Gounder on 3 May, 2023
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/146393726/
19
objections as raised by the objectors in respect of the same are overruled. Accordingly,
IA/181/CHE/2021, IA/183/CHE/2021, IA/192/CHE/2021, IA/172/CHE/2021 and
IA/291/CHE/2021 stand dismissed.” 15.4. Moving on to the questions concerning the related party -
Dharani Finance Limited - and the applications moved by it, the Adjudicating Authority took note of
the submissions on its behalf with reference to Section 21(2) of the Code that it could not have been
categorised as related party but rejected this contention while observing as under: -
“93. A bare perusal of the said provision shows that, even though the Applicants viz.
M/s. Dharani Finance Limited are regulated by a financial service regulator, they
have miserably failed to establish that the debts due to them have become due solely
on account of conversion or substitution of debt into equity shares or instruments
convertible into equity shares. Further the phrase "completion of such transactions as
may be prescribed" would also be of no avail, since the transactions as such have not
been prescribed by the Board. In any case, this Tribunal is of the considered view that
the Applicants in MA/18/CHE/2021 and MA/48/CHE/2021 are related party in
respect of the Corporate Debtor and that the decision of the IRP / RP in categorizing
the Applicant viz. M/s. Dharani Finance Limited as "Related Party" of Corporate
Debtor is free from all legal infirmities and does not warrant any interference by this
Adjudicating Authority. Accordingly, MA/18/CHE/2021 and MA/48/CHE/2021
stands dismissed.” 15.4.1. The Adjudicating Authority also examined the question of
discrimination in the resolution plan in respect of distribution of amount to the
financial creditor-related party compared with the financial creditor-
unrelated party. The Adjudicating Authority referred to the principles stated by this Court in
Committee of Creditors of Essar Steel India Limited through Authorised Signatory v. Satish Kumar
Gupta and Ors.: (2020) 8 SCC 531 and rejected those contentions while observing that in the
scheme of the Code, there was no provision which mandatorily requires payment to the related party
in parity with the unrelated party. In this regard, the Adjudicating Authority, inter alia, observed as
under: -
“(IV) DISCRIMINATION IN THE RESOLUTION PLAN:-
94. Another rival contention put forth by the Learned Senior Counsel for the objectors was that
there was is a discrimination in respect of the distribution of amount to the Financial Creditor -
Related Party compared with the Financial Creditor – unrelated Party. It was contended that no
amount is paid by the Resolution Applicant, to the Related Party of the Corporate Debtor, be it
Financial Creditor or Operational Creditor. In this regard, it is to be noted here that the way in
which the amount has to be distributed and paid, purely falls within the domain of the Resolution
Applicant and further the CoC in its commercial wisdom has accepted the same. Further, there is no
provision in the IBC, 2016 which mandates that the Related party should be paid in parity with the
unrelated party.…
95. It must be noted here that so long as the provisions of the Code and the Regulations have been
met, it is the commercial wisdom of the requisite majority of the CoC which is to negotiate and
M.K. Rajagopalan vs Dr. Periasamy Palani Gounder on 3 May, 2023
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/146393726/
20
accept a resolution plan, which may involve differential payment to different classes of creditors,
together with negotiating with a prospective resolution applicant for better or different terms which
may also involve differences in distribution of amounts between different classes of creditors…
96. Thus, the contentions of the Learned Senior Counsel for the objectors that differential treatment
are being made to them since they are related party in respect of the Corporate Debtor do not hold
any merit in view of the discussions made supra and also the decisions referred in support of the
same. Hence the objections raised by the objectors in relation to the said issues are overruled.” 15.5.
The Adjudicating Authority also took note of the question relating to the pending avoidance
application and recorded its satisfaction that the provision had duly been made in the resolution
plan as to the fate of the avoidance application and hence, the objections in that regard were
required to be eschewed.
15.6. Apart from the above, the Adjudicating Authority also dealt with the objections raised by one of
the other prospective resolution applicants but those aspects need not be dilated for the present
purpose.
16. After recording its findings on the issues raised by the parties, the Adjudicating Authority
proceeded to approve the resolution plan while recording its satisfaction as regards all the
mandatory compliances by the plan in the following manner: -
“(V) APPROVAL OF RESOLUTION PLAN
103. Thus, after overruling all the objections raised in relation to the Resolution Plan, this
Adjudicating Authority in so far as the approval of the Resolution Plan is concerned, section 30(6) of
the IBC, 2016 cast certain duties upon this Adjudicating Authority to examine the Resolution Plan as
to whether the Plan falls within the contours of the said Section. Hence, a comparison of the
mandatory compliance as required under IBC, 2016 vis-a-vis the compliance as made in the
Resolution Plan is being tabulated hereunder.

Essar Steel (supra); K. Sashidhar v. Indian Overseas Bank: (2019) 12 SCC 150; Jaypee Kensington
Boulevard Apartments Welfare Association and Ors. v. NBCC (India) Limited and Ors.: (2022) 1
SCC 401 and Maharashtra Seamless Ltd. v. Padmanabhan Venkatesh and Ors.: (2020) 11 SCC 467
as regards the principles that the Adjudicating Authority would not be sitting in appeal over the
commercial wisdom of CoC and also observed that there was no requirement that the bid of the
resolution applicant has to match the liquidation value of the corporate debtor. The Adjudicating
Authority also left the questions of various reliefs/concessions sought for by the resolution applicant
to be taken up in the appropriate forum or before the appropriate authority in accordance with law.
17.1. With the above-mentioned observations and findings, the Adjudicating Authority concluded on
the matter with approval of the resolution plan and with further directions in the following terms: -
“113. Thus the Resolution Plan is hereby approved and is binding on the Corporate
Debtor and other stakeholders involved so that revival of the Debtor Company shall
come into force with immediate effect and the "Moratorium" imposed under section
14 of IBC, 2016 shall not have any effect henceforth. The Resolution Professional
shall submit the records collected during the commencement of the Proceedings to
the Insolvency & Bankruptcy Board of India for their record and also return to the
Resolution Applicant or New Promoters. Certified copy of this Order be issued on

demand to the concerned parties, upon due compliance. Liberty is hereby granted for
moving any Miscellaneous Application, if required, in connection with
implementation of this Resolution Plan. That in respect of stepping by the New
Promoters/Resolution Applicant into the shoes of the erstwhile Company and taking
over the business, the provisions of Companies Act, 2013 shall be applicable and
because of this reason a copy of this Order is to be submitted in the Office of the
Registrar of Companies, Chennai.
114. The Resolution Professional is further directed to handover all records, premises / documents
to Resolution Applicant to finalise the further line of action required for starting of the operation as
contemplated under the Resolution Plan. The Resolution Applicant shall have access to all the
records premises / documents through Resolution Professional to finalise the further line of action
required for starting of the operation. Accordingly, the Application IA/150/CHE/2021 stands
allowed. All other connected Applications, as arrayed in the cause title, stands dismissed.”
Disapproval of the Appellate Tribunal (NCLAT)
18. Being aggrieved of the order dated 15.07.2021 so passed by the Adjudicating Authority,
approving the resolution plan of the resolution applicant and declaring it to be binding on the
corporate debtor and other stakeholders, four appeals were preferred before the Appellate Tribunal,
respectively by the promoter Dr. Periasamy Palani Gounder, the related party Dharani Finance
Limited and the NRI shareholder Dr. V. Janakiraman, the details whereof have been noticed
hereinbefore in the particulars of proceedings and parties.
19. After considering the said appeals together, the Appellate Tribunal (NCLAT) proceeded to allow
the same by its impugned judgment and order dated 17.02.2022. The Appellate Tribunal reversed
the order of the Adjudicating Authority and while rejecting the resolution plan in question,
remanded the matter to the CoC with directions to the resolution professional, inter alia, to proceed
from the stage of publication of Form ‘G’, and to invite the EOI afresh as per the CIRP Regulations.
Having regard to the questions raised in these appeals, it shall be apposite to take note of the
observations, findings, and conclusions of the Appellate Authority as relevant for the present matter
in necessary details20. 19.1. As regards the issue of valuation, the Appellate Tribunal, after
discussing the requirements of Sections 30(2) and 61(3) of the Code and taking note of the minutes
of the second CoC meeting as to the appointment of valuators and the other legal issues concerning
the valuation of assets, held that the valuation process had been in violation of the Regulation 27
and 35 of the CIRP Regulations for the reasons that the appraisal of a property situated in Tamil
Nadu by Delhi-based valuers was a point of contention during the second CoC meeting; the
non-core assets were not valuated by the registered valuers; the valuation report was never
circulated either to the promoters or to the other members of the CoC; and physical verification of
the assets of the corporate debtor was not carried out by the two valuers appointed by CoC.
19.1.1 The observations of the NCLAT as to the issue of valuation could be reproduced as under: -
“76……Whether the approved Resolution Plan contravenes Section 30 (2) and Sec
61(3) of the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code 2016?

*** *** ***
80. It is pertinent to mention that the Approval of the Resolution Plan by the COC is
directly attributable to the fact that the COC was not properly apprised of the actual
value of the Corporate Debtor's assets. The choices of the valuers by the IRP have
been questionable since the 2nd COC meeting. The concern stems from the fact that
the valuers were based in Delhi and had little knowledge of the prevailing real estate
market conditions in Tamil Nadu. The circumstances were further separated by the
fact that valuers lacked adequate experience with the hospitality industry. In 20 It
may be indicated that the emphasis in bold/italics/underlining in the extractions
from the judgment of the Appellate Tribunal are as in the copy thereof placed on
record before us.
this regard, it is pertinent to note the minutes of the 2nd COC meeting, which reads as follows;
"At this juncture, the COC members have raised concerns regarding the appointment
of the valuers as the appointed valuers are Delhi-based and are not privy to the
area/properties of Tamil Nadu and might also a struggle to visit the collective sites of
the corporate debtor located at Tamil Nadu given that travel restrains in the current
period----- the competency of the process valuation might decrease. The COC
members also requested the chairman to circulate the profiles in a comparative chart.
The members had difficulty being faced evaluating the profile/experience of the
appointed valuers with respect to the hospitality industry."
81. It is further evident from the minutes of the COC meetings that the two valuers appointed by the
IRP differs significantly and therefore warranted the appointment of a third valuer. Furthermore,
the RP has also admitted in the 6th COC meeting that only the ‘Core Assets’ of the Corporate Debtor
were valued, and the ‘Non-Core Assets’ has not been appropriately valued. Therefore, the 3rd Valuer
was also supposed to value the Non-Core Assets. Still, the RP, as evident from the minutes of the 6th
meeting of the Committee of Creditors, made it clear that another valuer needs to be appointed to
value the Company's non-core assets, which was not done. Therefore, the Valuation of the non-core
assets is not in compliance with Regulation 35 (1) (a) of the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Board of
India (Insolvency Resolution Process for Corporate Persons) Regulations, 2016.
82. It is pertinent to point out that due to lockdown, quarantine and travel restrictions, the
appointed valuers could not conduct the Valuation and their agents at or near Chennai who are not
registered valuers and lacked the expertise to conduct the exercise on their behalf. Therefore, further
physical verification of the assets by the registered valuers is indispensable, and the Respondent has
taken the same note before furnishing the Valuation to the COC. Moreover, the details of the
purported "Associates" of the ‘Registered Valuers’ have not been disclosed, and the COC has neither
considered nor approved the said Associate Valuers. Conveniently, the valuation reports have not
been disclosed to date, and only the Valuation is sought to be accepted as gospel truth. Therefore,
the Valuation furnished to the COC is in utter violation of Regulation 35 (1) (a) of the Insolvency and
Bankruptcy Board of India (Insolvency Resolution Process for Corporate Persons) Regulations, 2016
M.K. Rajagopalan vs Dr. Periasamy Palani Gounder on 3 May, 2023

26
and contrary to Rule 8 of the Companies (Registered Valuers and Valuation) Rules, 2017.
83. Further, it is necessary to mention that many members of the COC raised concerns relating to
the Valuation. Even in the 7th meeting of the COC, concerns were raised as to the fact that the
Resolution Plan values the Corporate Debtor at a rate that is significantly lower than the already
paltry Valuation arrived at by the IRP. Moreover, the RP himself admitted the aforesaid fact in the
aforesaid meeting.
*** *** ***
86. Based on the above discussion, it is apparent that the two valuers appointed by IRP did not
physically verify the corporate debtor's assets despite that Regulation 35 (1) (a) of the CIRP
Regulations mandates explicitly that the estimator fair value and liquidation value shall be
computed after physical verification of the assets of the Corporate Debtor. It is further revealed that
the valuation report was never circulated either to the Appellant or to other members of the COC.
Mere production of naked values without the detailed adjunct report would materially handicap the
commercial wisdom of the Committee of Creditors.
87. Further, Regulation 27 Regulation 35 mandates that two registered valuers value the Corporate
Debtor's assets. It is an admitted fact that the two registered valuers appointed by the Resolution
Professional did not value the non-core assets of the Corporate Debtor. However, in view of the
detailed valuation report, no member of the COC of the Appellant herein has any idea as to what was
categorised as a ‘Non-Core Assets’ by the Resolution Professional or what its value could be. These
are the blatant statutory violations and irregularities committed in violation of the corporate debt
assets.” 19.2. The Appellate Tribunal also held that compliance with statutory requirements
regulating a matter of practice and procedure were mandatory in character and the Tribunal being a
creature of a statute cannot dilute the statutory compliances in the following words: -
“88. However, the learned Adjudicating Authority/NCLT's observation that ‘A
statutory provision regulating a matter of practice or procedure will generally be read
as a directory and not mandatory is erroneous. Compliance with statutory
requirements in regulating a matter of practice and procedure are mandatory.’ The
Tribunal is a creature of statute, and by interpretation, it cannot dilute the statutory
compliances.” 19.3. After noticing non-compliance of Regulation 36-A(2)(iii) of the
CIRP Regulations that mandates publication of Form-G at the earliest and not later
than 75th day from the insolvency commencement date, the Appellate Tribunal held
that the publication of Form G on the designated website was essential and failure to
advertise as mandated had a direct impact on the maximization of asset value, more
so when the entire CIRP was conducted during lockdown at the time of Covid-19
pandemic when most of the people avoided reading the newspaper under the
apprehension of infection. The relevant parts of the order of the Appellate Tribunal in
this regard read as under: -
M.K. Rajagopalan vs Dr. Periasamy Palani Gounder on 3 May, 2023
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/146393726/
27
“89. ……… Non-Publication of Form-G As Per Regulation 36A(2) (iii) of the IBBI
Regulations for Corporate Persons, 2016
90. As per Regulation 36A(2)(iii), the RP shall publish ‘Form-G’ on the Corporate
Debtors and IBBI websites. This would ensure adequate publicity to all prospective
Resolution Applicants. This was admittedly not done by the RP. The IRP published
the Form-G only in a newspaper.
91. In fact, in the 5th CoC Meeting dated 12.11.2020, while discussing whether ‘Form
G’ should be re-published, the present RP points out that it was not published on the
IBBI website, which may lead to litigation in the future. However, no steps were
taken to re-publish ‘Form-G’ and invite fresh bids despite this. This was done despite
the exclusion of the period between 05.05.2020 and 31.10.2020 from the period of
CIRP by the Ld. Tribunal.
92. A plea regarding non-compliance of Regulation 36A of IBC has explicitly been
taken by the Appellant in its Affidavit objecting to the Plan before the Ld. Tribunal.
The impugned order itself records that the plea of non-compliance of regulation 36A
was raised.
93. Non-publication of ‘Form-G’ violates Circular No. IP (CIRP)/006/2018 dated
23.02.2018 issued by the IBBI, which provides the designated website for publication
of ‘Form-G’, i.e. invite.rp@ibbi.gov.in. Failure to advertise as mandated to ensure
that more Resolution Applicants could come forward directly impacts the
maximization of asset value.
94. Despite violations above about the publication of ‘Form-G’, the Learned Tribunal
has approved the Resolution Plan. On pages 142- 144 of Vol. of Appeal, sets out a list
of provisions that have been complied with. Regulation 36A does not even find a
mention in this.
*** *** ***
97. Further, it is well settled that the scope of interference concerning the Successful
Resolution Plan is extremely limited in nature. Challenge can only be in respect of
grounds as provided in Section 30 (2) or Section 61 (3) of the IBC 2016, which is
limited to matters “other than” the enquiry into the autonomy or commercial wisdom
of the Committee of Creditors.
98. It is pertinent to mention that an appeal against the approval of the Resolution
Plan shall lie under Section 61 (3) of the IBC on the ground, namely, there has been a
material irregularity in exercise of the powers by Resolution Professional during the
Corporate Insolvency Resolution period.

99. Further, it is necessary to mention that Regulation 36 A of CIRP Regulations
mandates publication of Form-G at the earliest, not later than the 75th day from the
insolvency commencement date, from interested and eligible prospective resolution
applicants to submit Resolution Plans.
100. Non-compliance with the above regulatory provision is admitted. It is also
important to point out that this entire CIRP was conducted during lockdown when
the world faced Covid19 Pandemic. At that time, most people avoided reading the
newspaper under the apprehension of Covid infection. So the publication of ‘Form-G’
for inviting Expression of Interest was essential. It is also important to point out that
the Government of India also brought some amendments in the Code considering the
impact of the Pandemic. Relevant Regulation about inviting ‘EOI’ is given below for
ready reference;” 19.4. Further, the Appellate Tribunal declared the resolution
applicant ineligible to submit a resolution plan in terms of Section 29-A(e) of the
Code on account of being disqualified as a director under Section 164(2)(b) of the
Companies Act as also because of operation of Section 88 of the Trusts Act.
19.4.1. As regards the ineligibility in terms of the Trusts Act, it was held that the case of resolution
applicant was unambiguously falling within the scope of Section 88 of the Trusts Act, rendering the
resolution plan in question as illegal because the trust 'Sri Balaji Vidyapeeth' was already declared
ineligible, of which, the resolution applicant was the managing trustee that precluded him from
acting as its alter ego during the execution of the resolution plan and obtaining any financial
advantage or benefit as being barred under Section 88.
19.4.2. The relevant observations and findings of the Appellate Tribunal in regard to this aspect read
as under: -
“101. Resolution Applicants ineligibility u/s 29A(e) of the Code……….
*** *** ***
105. The CoC was merely informed that one of the PRA21 charitable trusts was not
authorised to take up this activity. However, the rejected Trust was none other than
the 2nd Respondent's Trust, namely 'Balaji Vidyapeeth', which was never disclosed to
the COC and has been deliberately suppressed. The IRP/ Resolution Professional
should have informed the CoC that the 2nd Respondent had presented the Resolution
Plan by competing with the said Trust. He has used the very same ‘’Trust’ to support
his credentials and creditworthiness in the Resolution Plan. The relevant portions of
the Resolution Plan are extracted hereunder for ready reference:
"3.5. Sri Balaji Vidyapeeth:
Mr M.K. Rajagopalan is the founder and managing trustee of Sri Balaji Vidyapeeth...
M.K. Rajagopalan vs Dr. Periasamy Palani Gounder on 3 May, 2023
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/146393726/
29
3.10. Financial Snapshot"
The entities under the leadership of Mr. M.K. Rajagopalan have been growing rapidly
while ensuring quality of service to nation and public at large...
These entities have achieved turnover of Rs.417.94 Crores in FY 2016-2017;
Rs.500.03 Crores in FY 2017-2018; Rs. 679.23 Crores in FY 2018-2019 and
Rs.860.59 Crores (estimated) for FY 2019- 2020.
The above growth is ample testimony of the credentials of the RA as a competent
business leader and his capability to manage and turn around various diverse
businesses."
106. Therefore, it is incorrect to say that the 2nd Respondent has not gained any advantage from the
charitable Trust. The case on hand squarely falls within the ambit of Section 88 of the Indian Trusts
Act, and as such, the Resolution Plan is illegal. Since the said 'Sri Balaji Vidyapeeth' has already
been declared as ineligible, the 2nd Respondent cannot act as its alter ego in implementing the
Resolution Plan and attain any financial advantage or gain is barred by Section 88 of the Indian
Trusts Act. The said provision is extracted hereunder for ready reference.22 *** *** *** 21
Prospective Resolution Applicant.
22 "Section 88. Advantage gained by fiduciary. Where a trustee, executor, partner, agent, director of
a company, legal adviser, or other person bound in a fiduciary character to protect the interests of
another person, by availing himself of his character, gains for himself any pecuniary advantage, or
where any person so bound enters into any dealings under circumstances in which his own interests
are, or may be, adverse to those of such other person and thereby gains for himself a pecuniary
advantage, he must hold for the benefit of such other person the advantage so gained."
108. It is illogical and fallacious to claim that the Resolution Plan can be tested in terms of the
provisions of IBC, 2016 and not under Section 88 of the Indian Trusts Act. Therefore, it is submitted
that even as per the provisions of IBC, a Resolution Plan shall be by the provisions of all other
statutes, and the Resolution Plan mustn't contravene the law of the land. In this regard, it is
pertinent to note Sections 30 and 61 of the Code, which reads as follows: "Section 30. Submission of
Resolution Plan. – (2) The Resolution professional shall examine each resolution plan received by
him to confirm that each resolution plan – …
(e) does not contravene any of the provisions of the law for the time being in force.
….
Section 61. Appeals and Appellate Authority. – (3) An appeal against an order approving a
resolution plan under section 31 may be filed on the following grounds, namely: --

30
(i) the approved resolution plan is in contravention of the provisions of any law for the time being in
force;."
109. The argument of the 2nd Respondent that the Trust had submitted their EOIs independently
and both of them were aware that the other was submitting their EOIs is purely mischievous.
Admittedly, the 2nd Respondent is the Managing Director of the said Trust, and the fact remains
that two EOIs were submitted by the 2nd Respondent, one for himself and the other on behalf of the
Trust.
110. However, the said facts have been suppressed from the CoC, and the CoC did not have an
occasion to consider that the 2nd Respondent had submitted two EOIs. Therefore, it is also false to
claim that the 2nd Respondent had complied with the provisions of the RFRP and the IBC. The 2nd
Respondent suppressed material facts and gave false declarations about his ineligibility and the
conflict of interest.
111. The argument of IInd Respondent that a conflict of interest would arise in case the Trust were
allowed to submit a Resolution Plan is incorrect and misleading. The purported Explanation of
conflict of interest' stated in the RFRP would not absolve the duty cast upon the IInd Respondent
under Section 88 of the Indian Trusts Act. Further, it is incorrect to state that a conflict of interest
could arise only between two Resolution Applicants. Such an interpretation is contrary to the
explicit provisions of Section 88 of the Indian Trusts Act. Therefore, it is incorrect to say that the
2nd Respondent has not gained any advantage from the charitable Trust.
112. The case on hand squarely falls within the ambit of Section 88 of the Indian Trusts Act, and as
such, the Resolution Plan is illegal. Since the said 'Sri Balaji Vidyapeeth' has already been declared
as ineligible, the 2nd Respondent cannot act as its alter ego in implementing the Resolution Plan
and attain any financial advantage or gain is barred by Section 88 of the Indian Trusts Act. 19.4.3.
As to the question of disqualification under Section 164(2)(b), the Appellate Tribunal observed that
Mr. M.K. Rajagopalan was the director of International Aviation Academy Private Limited, and as
seen from the audited financial statements of the said company, from 2010-2011 to 2017- 2018, a
sum of Rs. 12,03,000/- was collected by the said company as ‘share application money pending
allotment’. The Appellate Tribunal further noticed that the said sum was not refunded and as such,
was to be treated as ‘deposit’ in terms of Explanation (a) to Rule 2(1)(c)(vii) of the Companies
(Acceptance of Deposits) Rules, 2014 as a consequence of which, in terms of Section 164(2)(b) of the
Companies Act, the resolution applicant stood disqualified from acting as a director in any company
for a period of five years from the date on which the said International Aviation Academy Private
Limited failed to repay the deposit amount. Some of the relevant observations and the findings of
the Appellate Tribunal in this regard could be noticed in the following extraction: -
“117. The learned Senior Counsel for the 2nd respondent has vehemently argued that
the objection raised by the appellant was never raised before the Adjudicating
Authority. In response to this objection, Learned Counsel for the appellant submits
no estoppel against a statute. Section 61 (3) empowers the Appellate Tribunal to
question irregularities and illegalities in the CIRP, including the Resolution Plan. The

31
Resolution Plan being in rem, these questions fall within the exclusive purview of
judicial review. These grounds cannot be eschewed from consideration on the simple
ground that they were never raised before NCLT, as persons who were not before
NCLT are also before this court.
118. The Ld Senior counsel for the Appellants, in response to the above submissions of Respondent
No.2, regarding the disqualification of the 2nd Respondent, argued that the 2nd Respondent is a
Director of M/s. International Aviation Academy Private Limited, and it is seen from the audited
financial statements of the said Company for the period 2010-2011 to 2017-2018 that a sum of
Rs.12,03,000/- has been collected as 'share application money pending allotment'.
119. It appears that the said sum has not been refunded, and as such, the same shall be treated as
'deposit' in terms of Explanation
(a) of Rule 2(1)(c)(vii) of The Companies (Acceptance of Deposits) Rules, 2014. In the above
circumstances, given Section 164 (2) (b) of the Companies Act, the 2nd Respondent has been
disqualified from acting as a Director in any Company for five years from the date on which the said
Ms International Aviation Academy Private Limited failed to repay the deposit amounts collected
towards 'share application money pending allotment' aggregating to Rs.12,03,000/.
120. Even assuming these amounts have been repaid during 2018- 2019, the 2nd Respondent is
disqualified from acting as a director to date. Thus, the 2nd Respondent is not eligible to act as a
resolution applicant as per Section 29-A(e) of the Code. The audited balance sheets of the said M/s.
International Aviation Academy Private Limited for the years from 2011 to 2018.
121. The 2nd Respondent has suppressed the above facts and has submitted the Resolution Plan by
giving a false declaration that he does not suffer from any disqualification. Now, the 2nd
Respondent has claimed that Rs.12,03,000/- was paid by himself to the said M/s. International
Aviation Academy Private Limited and that him being a member/ Director of the said Company,
such payment would not amount to 'deposit' as per Rule 2(1)(c)(viii) of The Companies (Acceptance
of Deposits) Rules, 2014 and General Circular No. 5 dated 30.03.2015, issued by the Ministry of
Corporate Affairs.
122. The 2nd Respondent has chosen not to file any document to support the above contention and
has failed to discharge his burden under Section 106 of the Indian Evidence Act, 1872.
123. Suppose it is considered that the sum of Rs.12,03,000/- was paid by the 2nd Respondent to the
said M/s. International Aviation Academy Private Limited, the Application of Rule 2(1)(c)(viii) of
The Companies (Acceptance of Deposits) Rules, 2014 is subject to the conditions stipulated therein,
which have not been complied with. Therefore, it is misleading to state that Private Limited
Companies have been granted a specific exemption.
124. Further, even as per the General Circular No.5 dated 30.03.2015, any renewal of deposit after
01.04.2014 shall be in accordance with the Companies Act, 2013 and the rules made thereunder. It

32
is thus patent that the said sum of Rs.12,03,000/- is a deposit, and as such, the 2nd Respondent is
disqualified from acting as a Director given Section 164(2)(b) of the Companies Act, 2013.
125. It is correct to say that the IRP/RP should be concerned as to whether a Resolution Application
submitting his EOI is eligible as per the provisions of Section 29-A of the Code. Apparently, in the
case on hand, the 1st Respondent has not properly verified the eligibility of the 2nd Respondent and
has acted solely based upon the false declarations given by the 2nd Respondent.
126. However, the Appellant is well within his rights to question the legality of the CIRP and the
Resolution Plan.
127. Based on the above discussion, it is clear that the 2nd Respondent is disqualified as a director
under section 164 (2) (b), Companies Act, 2013 and consequently ineligible to submit a Resolution
Plan under Sec. 29A(e) of the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code 2016.” 19.5. In relation to the
assertion of the resolution professional that the revised resolution plan was approved in the ninth
CoC meeting, the Appellate Tribunal examined the relevant minutes and observed that in the said
meeting, the resolution plan was sent back to the resolution applicant for further revision based on
the CoC resolution; and the revised resolution plan submitted by the resolution applicant dated
25.01.2021, was directly filed in the NCLT for approval without being put to vote before CoC. The
Appellate Tribunal observed that as per the requirements of Sections 30 and 31 of the Code, only the
plan approved by CoC was to be presented before NCLT for approval. It was further held by the
Appellate Tribunal that such procedural failure was that of a material irregularity, undermining the
integrity of the process and rendering the resolution plan void and non est in law. The observations
of the Appellate Tribunal with respect to this issue of want of approval of the revised resolution plan
by CoC could be usefully reproduced as under: -
“130. On perusal of the minutes of 9th COC, it is clear that COC did not finally
approve the Resolution Plan on 22 January 2021. In this meeting, COC sent back the
Resolution Plan to the Resolution Applicant for further revision based on the CoC
Resolution. This revised Resolution Plan dated 25 January 2021 was never sent for
Approval before the COC.
131. The Resolution Professional’s statement that ‘the revised Resolution Plan was approved at the
9th COC meeting’ is incorrect. Although the Resolution Plan was allegedly approved on 22 January
2021, it is not the Revised Resolution Plan. Instead, the Resolution Plan was further modified based
on the CoC resolution Dt.22.1.2021. But the final Revised Resolution Plan, dated 25 January 2021,
was never laid before the CoC for its approval. Thus the approval of the Resolution Plan by the
Adjudicating Authority is not in compliance with Sec. 31(1) of the I & B Code, 2016.
132. It is pertinent to mention that after Approval of the Resolution Plan by COC entire exercise for
revising the Resolution Plan for making a complaint with Section 30 (2) of the Code was left with
the Resolution Applicant. Revised Resolution Plan dated 25 January 2021, without further approval
of CoC, was presented by RP before the Adjudicating Authority for approval, which was finally
approved by the impugned Order.

33
133. It is also important to mention that the learned Adjudicating Authority/National Company Law
Tribunal has stated in the impugned order that “it is seen that the final resolution plan was put up
for consideration by the COC in the 9th meeting held on 22 January 2021 and the said resolution
was approved with a thumping majority of 87.39%.”
134. The Adjudicating Authority failed to notice that the Resolution Plan was not approved in the
9th COC meeting. Therefore, based on the resolution of the 9th COC meeting, the Resolution Plan
was to be sent back to the Resolution Applicant for further revision. After that, the final Revised
Resolution Plan was made on 25 January 2021, but it was never presented before the COC for
approval.
135. After "revision", the revised plan is never put to the vote. Instead, it is filed to NCLT directly,
without any approval from the COC on the revised Resolution Plan. Sections 30(2), 30(4), 30(6) and
Section 31 mandate that only a plan as approved by the ‘COC’ can be presented to the NCLT for its
approval under Section 31. Such kind of procedural failure amounts to material irregularity and goes
to the root of the matter, making the plan void and non-est in law, as it is trite law that where the
law permits a thing to be done in a particular manner if the same is not done in that manner, the
same is non-est in the eyes of the law.” 19.6. As regards the issue of non-consideration of Section
12-A IBC application of the promoter of the corporate debtor, the Appellate Tribunal observed that
the consideration of settlement offer was essential and that the settlement offer could not have been
rejected without consideration by the CoC. It was further held that CoC, in its commercial wisdom,
had full liberty to either accept or reject the settlement offer but, consideration of the settlement
offer was indispensable. In regard to this aspect, the Appellate Tribunal observed and held as under:
-
“140. Based on the pleadings of the parties, it is clear that the COC meeting was not called for
consideration of the 12 A application. Since ‘Form FA’ has to be submitted only by the Applicant
Financial Creditor after the proposal floated by the promoters is considered, and only after the
proposal has been accepted by 90% of the Committee of Creditors, the Applicant Financial Creditor
has to file the proposal as per Form FA. Thus, it is clear that the Resolution Professional cannot
disregard the proposal for conducting a meeting of the CoC on such an untenable and superficial
ground.
141. It appears that based on the settlement offer, the appellant sent a letter to the Financial Creditor
Tourism Finance Corporation of India that an investor has expressed its willingness to infuse funds
of 350 crores to settle the secured Financial Creditors in full within 30 days. This amount will be
deposited in the current account. Regarding the claims made by other Unsecured Financial
Creditors, Operational Creditors, implies, and other stakeholders, it will be settled after discussion
with them and out of the generation of funds from the company's operation. In the circumstances,
the appellant requested to accept the settlement so that the 12 A application may be submitted
before the NCLT. The term sheet of the Deutsche Bank was also annexed with the settlement offer.
142. It is also necessary to mention that when the appeal was filed, then on the 1st date of admission
of the Appeal, i.e. 30 July 2021, the learned counsel for the appellant made a statement in the court
M.K. Rajagopalan vs Dr. Periasamy Palani Gounder on 3 May, 2023
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/146393726/
34
that the appellant would deposit ˆ 450 crores. Therefore, he requires 2 or 3 days. Since the total
Resolution Plans amount was 423 crores, the Appellant contended that assets of the corporate
debtor are worth over rupees for 1600 crores. It is also contended that the 12 A application was
pending, but it was not considered and voted. Considering all the situations and bona fides of the
appellant, this Appellate Tribunal granted an interim stay on implementing the impugned order.
143. Based on the pleadings of the parties, it appears that a settlement offer was made, and a 12 A
application was to be submitted after getting the consent of 90% members of the COC. In the
circumstances, the appellant requested to consider the settlement proposal in the COC. However,
COC was never called to consider the settlement offer. The Resolution Professional has contended
that the COC has rejected the settlement offer in its 9th meeting. This statement is also not as per
the minutes of the 9th COC meeting. It appears from the minutes of the 9th COC that only a
Resolution Plan was discussed in that meeting. After that, the Resolution Plan was sent back to the
resolution applicant by CoC for reconsideration and revision. In the 9 COC meetings, no discussion
about the settlement offer occurred. It is essential to mention that after admission of the petition
and formation of the Committee of Creditors, Section 12A application for withdrawal could only be
accepted if the CoC approves the proposal with a 90% vote share. It is undisputed that COC, under
its commercial wisdom, had full liberty to either accept or reject the settlement offer. But
consideration of the settlement offer is essential. At this juncture, this tribunal “Worth recalls and
recollects” the judgement of Hon’ble 3 Member Bench of this Tribunal in Company Appeal (AT)
(Ins) No.91 of 2019 dated 6 September 2019 between Shaji Purusothaman v Union Bank of India
and others (reported in MANU/NL/0438/2019) whereby and whereunder at paragraph 9 it is
observed that;
“if an application u/s 12 A is filed by the Appellant, the Committee of Creditors may decide as to
whether the proposal given by the appellant for settlement in terms of Section 12 A is better than the
resolution plan as approved by it, and may pass appropriate order. However, as such decision is
required to be taken by the “Committee of Creditors”, we are not expressing any opinion on the
same.”
144. In this case, CoC never considered the settlement proposal submitted by the Appellant.
Although, after getting the settlement proposal, it was incumbent upon the resolution professional
to call the COC meeting to consider the settlement proposal. It is essential to mention that the
settlement offer could not have been rejected without consideration by the COC.” 19.7. As regards
the question of discrimination between the claims of related party and unrelated party, the
Appellate Tribunal, while placing reliance on the decision of this Court in Phoenix ARC (P) Ltd v.
Spade Financial Services Ltd. and Ors.: (2021) 3 SCC 475 observed that ‘related party’ was
specifically treated as a class unto itself and was restricted from any involvement in the CIRP in any
capacity (under Section 21 IBC) and disqualified from being a resolution applicant (under Section
29-A IBC), the underlying object being that involvement of a related party in the CIRP is seen as
giving unfair benefit to the corporate debtor and in fact, the related party is treated in the same class
as the corporate debtor itself. Therefore, according to the Appellate Tribunal, a ‘related party’ could
be treated as a separate class independent of an unrelated party and ought to be equated with the
promoters as equity shareholders or as partners. After discussing various decisions of NCLT and
M.K. Rajagopalan vs Dr. Periasamy Palani Gounder on 3 May, 2023
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/146393726/
35
NCLAT as also of this Court as regards the position of related party vis-à-vis the unrelated, the
Appellate Authority held that the related party financial or operational creditor cannot be
discriminated against under the resolution plan, by denying their right to get payments under the
resolution plan only for being a related party. The Appellate Tribunal observed and held as under: -
“149. Under the IBC, 2016, there is no mandate to treat unrelated and related parties
equally. On the contrary, the IBC and Regulations thereunder specifically treat
'related party' as a class unto itself and restrict the involvement of a 'related party' in
any situation where the CIRP is likely to get affected. As held by the Hon’ble Supreme
Court in Phoenix ARC, the purpose is to ensure that external creditors drive the
CIRP. Following statutory provisions clarify that related party' is a class in itself.
Accordingly, a related party is prohibited from acting in any of the following
capacities in a CIRP:
                  Particulars                               Provisions
        Cannot       be     part     of          Sec. 21, IBC, 2016
        Committee of Creditors
        Cannot be a Resolution                   Sec. 29A, IBC, 2016

        Cannot be a liquidator                   Reg. 3, IBBI (Liquidation

        formed of the Operational                2016
        Creditors
150. The underlying object is that the involvement of a related party in the CIRP in
any capacity is seen as giving unfair benefit to the Corporate Debtor. In short, a
related party is treated in the same class as the Corporate Debtor itself.
151. Therefore, this statutory recognition as a different class would apply even to a
Resolution Plan when the CoC decides whether, in its commercial wisdom, it should
pay to a related party at all as this would mean paying to the same persons who are
behind the Corporate Debtor.

157. Thus, it is well-settled that a ‘related party’ can be treated as a separate class
independent of an unrelated party. Such ‘related party’ ought to be equated with the
promoters as 'equity shareholders as partners.
*** *** ***
162. In the instant case of approved resolution plan discriminates between related
party unsecured Financial Creditor and other unsecured Financial Creditors, likewise
related party operational creditors and other operational creditors. The appellant
argues that its claim ought to be treated equally to an unrelated Operational/
Financial Creditor given the equality clause enshrined under Article 14 of the
Constitution of India.
*** *** ***
171. It is important to mention that related parties are barred from participating in
the COC to avoid sabotaging the COC. Per contra, the claim filed by the related party,
based on their admitted claims, would have influenced the CIRP if they had been
permitted to participate in the COC. After completion of the CIRP and after approval
of the Resolution Plan, if any amount is allotted to related party financial or
operational creditors, it would not impact the CIRP.
172. It is also necessary to point out that code is a self-contained code. Therefore, any
provision that restricts related-party Financial Or Operational Creditor actions is
stated in the code. Thus, the Adjudicating Authority / NCLT/NCLAT cannot further
limit the rights of Related Party Financial or Operational Creditors by way of
interpretation. Furthermore, restrictions on the related party rights under CIRP
under Code and Regulation are provided at different places. Therefore, its scope
cannot be exceeded further by way of interpretation.
173. Thus, it is clear that IBC treats related parties as a separate category for specified
purposes, excluding from the CoC under Section 21 and disqualifying them from
being Resolution Applicants under section 29A. However, the IBC does not treat
Related Party as a separate class for any other purpose.
Therefore, a rationale nexus must exist for any classification between the object sought to achieve
the classification and sub-classification. Therefore, the Related Party financial or operational
creditor cannot be discriminated against under the Resolution Plan, denying their right to get
payments under the Resolution Plan only on being a Related Party. It is also made clear that by
getting only payment under the Resolution Plan, related party creditors could in no way sabotage
the CIRP.” 19.8. The Appellate Tribunal, while concluding on its findings and reiterating its
observations on several issues including those noticed above, held that increase in RP’s fees with
retrospective effect was not a prudent decision of CoC; the possibility of an impact on the decision of
RP for submission of the resolution plan before the Adjudicating Authority without approval of CoC
M.K. Rajagopalan vs Dr. Periasamy Palani Gounder on 3 May, 2023
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/146393726/
37
cannot be ruled out. The Appellate Tribunal disapproved the order passed by the Adjudicating
Authority for the reasons: (a) existence of a valid and accurate valuation report was a sine qua non
for the CoC to exercise its commercial wisdom and observation of the Adjudicating Authority that
Regulation 35 of the CIRP Regulations contemplates sharing of only fair value and liquidation value
figures on obtaining confidentiality undertaking from the members of the CoC was incorrect; (b) the
compliance with statutory requirements in regulating a matter of practice and procedure was
mandatory and observation of Adjudicating Authority that a statutory provision regulating a matter
of practice or procedure would generally be regarded as directory and not mandatory was
erroneous; (c) non-publication of notices of Form G, inviting EOI, was a material irregularity in
exercise of the powers by resolution professional; (d) the resolution applicant was ineligible to
submit the resolution plan; (e) the revised resolution plan was filed before the Adjudicating
Authority without laying it before the CoC for approval violating Sections 30(2) and 30(3) of the
Code and thereby, vitiating the entire CIRP and rendering the resolution plan as void ab initio; and
(f) the related party financial or operational creditor could not have been discriminated by denying
their right to get payments under the resolution plan only on being a related party.
19.9. The Appellate Tribunal recorded its conclusions in the following terms: -
“CONCLUSION
174. The increase in RP fees with retrospective effect can not be considered as CoC's
prudent decision. The possibility of an impact on the decision of RP for the
submission of the Resolution Plan before the Adjudicating Authority for approval,
even without the approval of CoC, cannot be ruled out. Submission of the Resolution
Plan for Approval before the Adjudicating Authority violates the statutory provision
of Section 30(2) &(3) of the Code and has vitiated the entire CIRP and made the
Resolution Plan Void ab initio.
175. Further, Adjudicating Authority observation that Regulation 35 of the IBBI
(IRPCP) Regulations 2016 contemplates sharing of only fair value and liquidation
value figures on obtaining confidentiality undertaking from the members of the CoC
is incorrect. Finding that Since the Promoter is not a member of the CoC, the values
were shared with the Promoter and that there are no requirements under the law for
the RP to share the valuation report is also erroneous.
176. A valuation consisting of mere naked values without a detailed report is not
valid. It is a settled proposition that the Valuation exercise is conducted to facilitate
the CoC's decision-making process. Therefore, the existence of a valid and accurate
valuation report is a sine qua non for the COC to exercise its commercial wisdom. A
natural sequitur to those above would be that a detailed valuation report is necessary
for the CoC to exercise its commercial wisdom objectively.
177. The Adjudicating Authority’s observation that a statutory provision regulating a
matter of practice or procedure will generally be read as a directory and not
M.K. Rajagopalan vs Dr. Periasamy Palani Gounder on 3 May, 2023
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/146393726/
38
mandatory is erroneous. Compliance with statutory requirements in regulating a
matter of practice and procedure are mandatory. The Tribunal is a creature of
statute, and by interpretation, it cannot dilute the statutory compliances.
178. Further, observation of the Adjudicating Authority that procedural irregularities
in relation to the conduct of the proceedings in relation to the CoC will not be
material when the objectors failed to establish prejudice caused to them in respect of
the same is also erroneous.
179. Regulation 36(2) of CIRP Regulations provides the mandatory condition for
publication of ‘Form-G’ on the Corporate Debtor's website and the website
designated by the Board for the purpose. Non-publication of notices of Form G is a
material irregularity in exercise of the powers by Resolution Professional during the
Corporate Insolvency Resolution period. In the instant case, there has been a
material irregularity in exercising the powers by Resolution Professional during the
Corporate Insolvency Resolution Process.
180. Since the said Trust (Prospective Resolution Applicant) 'Sri Balaji Vidyapeeth' has already been
declared as ineligible, the 2nd Respondent (SRA) cannot be permitted to act as its alter ego in
implementing the Resolution Plan and attain any financial advantage or gain, which is barred by
Section 88 of the Indian Trusts Act.
181. The Resolution Professional made an incorrect statement that the revised Resolution Plan was
approved at the 9th COC meeting. The revised Resolution Plan was not approved on 22 January
2021. After 22nd January 2021, based on the COC Resolution Dt.22.1.2021, the Resolution Plan was
further modified, and the final Revised Resolution Plan dated 25 January 2021 was never laid before
the CoC for approval. Thus the approval of the Resolution Plan by the Adjudicating Authority can
not be treated as valid under Sec. 31(1) of the I & B Code, 2016.
182. However, the IBC does not treat Related Party as a separate class for any other purpose.
Therefore, a rationale nexus must exist for any classification between the object sought to achieve
the classification and sub-classification. Therefore, Related Party Financial or Operational Creditor
cannot be discriminated under the Resolution Plan only on being a Related Party.
183. Based on the discussion above, it is clear that IBC treats related parties as a separate category
for specified purposes, excluding from the CoC under Section 21 and disqualifying them from being
Resolution Applicants under Section 29A. However, the IBC does not treat Related Party as a
separate class for any other purpose. Therefore, a rationale nexus must exist for any classification
between the object sought to achieve the classification and sub-classification.
184. Therefore, the Related Party financial or operational creditor cannot be discriminated against
under the Resolution Plan, denying their right to get payments under the resolution Plan only on
being a Related Party. It is also made clear that by getting only payment under the Resolution Plan,
related party creditors could in no way sabotage the CIRP.

185. Based on the above discussion, it is clear that the approved Resolution Plan is in contravention
of Section 30 (2) of the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code 2016, which contravenes the provision of
law.”
20. Hence, the Appellate Authority set aside the resolution plan approved by the Adjudicating
Authority; directed the resolution professional to proceed with the CIRP from publication stage of
Form G for inviting EOI afresh as per the CIRP Regulations and further to put up the settlement
proposal of the promoter for consideration before CoC; and ordained that the claim of related party
financial/operational creditor be not discriminated from unrelated financial/operational creditors.
Proceedings in this Court
21. Aggrieved of the aforesaid judgment and order dated 17.02.2022 passed by the Appellate
Authority, eight appeals are filed before this Court. As noticed, one sub-set is of four appeals as filed
by the resolution applicant and other sub-set is of four appeals as filed by the resolution professional
against the promoter and erstwhile director of the corporate debtor, related financial and
operational creditor and against the NRI shareholder and erstwhile director of the corporate debtor.
The details whereof have been noticed hereinbefore in the particulars of proceedings and parties.
22. It would be worthwhile to mention a few relevant aspects from the record of proceedings in this
Court.
22.1. On 07.03.2022, civil appeals bearing numbers 1682-1683 of 2022, 1759 of 2022, 1756 of 2022,
1757 of 2022, 1807 of 2022 were called for hearing by this Court. During the hearing, counsel for the
resolution applicant and counsel for contesting parties were heard but the arguments of counsel for
the resolution professional remained inconclusive and the matter was posted to 11.03.2022 for
further hearing. It was further pointed out during the submissions that the resolution applicant has
filed two other civil appeals, bearing numbers 1810 of 2022 and 1827 of 2022, respectively against
Dr. V. Janakiraman and Dharani Finance Limited. The said appeals were ordered to be listed along
with this batch of matters on 11.03.2022. Further, learned counsel for the resolution professional
also placed before this Court the minutes of eleventh CoC meeting held on 03.03.2022 which were
ordered to be filed in the registry with appropriate affidavit. Later on, RP filed the minutes of the
eleventh CoC meeting as also the tenth CoC meeting and other documents with affidavit. The details
of these and other subsequent meetings of CoC are set out in the next segment of this judgment.
22.2. On 16.03.2022, after having heard learned counsel for the respective parties along with
rejoinder submissions at length, the judgment was reserved and learned counsel for the parties were
granted time to file their note/additional notes on their submissions by 22.03.2022. It was further
noted, during the course of submissions, that pursuant to the impugned order dated 17.02.2022 of
the Appellate Authority, CoC meeting had taken place on 03.03.2022 and that another meeting was
slated for 21.03.2022. As regards this submission, in the totality of circumstances, this Court
deemed it appropriate to allow the meetings/proceedings of the CoC to continue, subject to the final
orders to be passed in these appeals.

23. However, learned counsel for the resolution applicant filed an application for appropriate
directions in this matter on 14.05.2022, seeking ad interim direction of staying the CIRP as initiated
by the resolution professional by publishing Form G on 26.04.2022 pursuant to directions of the
NCLAT in its judgment dated 17.02.2022; or to stay the operation of impugned judgment dated
17.02.2022 as regards disqualification of the resolution applicant and to direct the resolution
professional to consider his EOI in the fresh CIRP as initiated.
23.1. The aforesaid application was taken on board by this Court on 20.05.2022. Having taken note
of the averments of the application and having regard to the order as passed on 16.03.2022, making
all the proceedings subject to final outcome of these appeals, this Court did not consider it necessary
or expedient at that stage to pass any further order or direction as regards the averment therein.
24. On 07.11.2022, Dr. Periasamy Palani Gounder - the promoter and erstwhile director of the
corporate debtor, filed an application bearing IA No. 168602 of 2022 in Civil Appeal Nos. 1682 of
2022, seeking permission to bring on record subsequent facts and documents that, during the
pendency of these appeals, his proposal of settlement under Section 12-A of the Code was accepted
by CoC on 12.10.2022 by 100 per cent. majority which had been placed before the Adjudicating
Authority for approval. 24.1. In reply to the aforesaid application, it was submitted on behalf of the
resolution applicant that the very consideration of Section 12-A application of the promoter by CoC
was against the explicit direction of the Appellate Authority in its judgment dated 17.02.2022, which
allowed only 15 days for the CoC to examine the pending or existing Section 12-A proposal of the
promoter which was rejected by the CoC on 25.03.2022 and therefore, the only recourse after such a
rejection available with CoC was to continue with the fresh CIRP and it had no legal authority to
consider or vote on a new application after issuance of fresh Form G. 24.2. In the wake of the
applications so moved, the matter was again taken on board by this Court on 17.11.2022 and after
having heard learned counsel for the respective parties this Court requested the Adjudicating
Authority to await the decision in these appeals while granting permission to learned counsel for the
respective parties to file further submissions in relation to the said application by 21.11.2022.
The events during pendency of these appeals.
25. To piece together a timeline, it would be worthwhile to take note of the subsequent events that
took place pursuant to the orders and directions as passed by the Appellate Authority in the order
impugned dated 17.02.2022 directing the resolution professional to proceed with the CIRP from
stage of publication of Form G inviting fresh EOI and for consideration of settlement proposal of the
promoter under Section 12-A IBC.
26. In compliance of the impugned order dated 17.02.2022 as passed by NCLAT, eleventh CoC
meeting was held on 03.03.2022; and the resolution professional put the settlement proposal of the
promoter to vote in the CoC, where the voting continued until 25.03.2022. Ultimately, the said
settlement proposal was voted against by 51.81% of voting share in CoC.
26.1. In the twelfth CoC meeting held on 18.04.2022, the eligibility criteria and evaluation matrix for
issuance of EOI was put to vote post discussion at this meeting and was approved with 92.52% of
M.K. Rajagopalan vs Dr. Periasamy Palani Gounder on 3 May, 2023
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/146393726/
41
total voting power of CoC members.
26.2. In the thirteenth CoC meeting held on 23.05.2022, resolution professional informed the
members of CoC that EOI was published on 26.04.2022 with last date of submission fixed as
15.05.2022 and 7 EOIs had been received. As regards the extension of time to submit EOI, the CoC
resolved that the last date of submission of EOI be extended to 09.06.2022 with 93.46% of the total
voting powers of CoC. It was further resolved that nothing in the Request for Resolution Plan
(RFRP) be changed and the performance bank guarantee (PBG) amount as decided earlier by CoC of
Rs. 25 crore shall stand approved and shall remain unchanged.
26.3. In the fourteenth CoC meeting held on 27.05.2022, it was resolved by CoC that RP shall
immediately seek extension of CIRP timelines further by 90 days with effect from 13.05.2022 under
Section 12(2) IBC application to be filed with the Adjudicating Authority. Further, in relation to
extension of time for submission of resolution plan, the CoC in its fifteenth meeting held on
19.07.2022, resolved with 92.70% voice vote to extend the timeline to 01.08.2022. As regards
further extension of time, in the sixteenth CoC meeting held on 10.08.2022, the CoC members with
total voting power of 79.29%, resolved for RP to file an application for further extension/exclusion
of time before the Adjudicating Authority for continuing with CIRP.
26.4. In the seventeenth CoC meeting held on 26.08.2022, discussing about the compliance of
resolution plans as submitted by the prospective resolution applicants, a query was raised by one of
the members of CoC that despite being declared disqualified and ineligible by NCLAT, as to why the
resolution plan of Mr. M.K. Rajagopalan – resolution applicant herein – was even being considered.
To this, the Chairperson responded that in the order dated 16.03.2022 this Court while reserving the
judgment clearly stated that all the meetings/proceedings of CoC shall continue subject to the final
orders to be passed by the Court and this information was clearly laid down with disclaimers in the
list of prospective resolution applicants as well as final list of eligible resolution applicants and was
known to everyone. He also stated that as regards this, legal advice had been sought and the CoC
also gave its consent.
26.5. In the eighteenth CoC meeting held on 29.09.2022, after informing the members of CoC that 7
resolution plans have been received till date and their evaluation was under process, the
Chairperson apprised the CoC that a revised settlement proposal has been submitted by the
promoter – Dr. Periasamy Palani Gounder – under Section 12-A IBC on 19.09.2022. The members
of the CoC debated on the possibilities of consideration of Section 12-A proposal vis-à-vis evaluation
and consideration of resolution plans as received. However, noticing that the mandatory 330 days
period was about to end on 12.10.2022, the CoC members unanimously voted and agreed for seeking
exclusion/extension of CIRP timelines and directed the RP to file suitable application under Section
12(2) IBC before the NCLT. 26.6. In the nineteenth CoC meeting held on 12.10.2022, the discussion
as regards the settlement proposal submitted by the promoter - Dr. Periasamy Palani Gounder -
continued and after an extensive discussion, the CoC decided to evaluate the 12-A proposal and put
it to vote. Accordingly, the settlement proposal was put to vote and was approved by the CoC with
100% of the total voting powers of members. The relevant parts of the resolutions adopted in this

submissions
27. We have heard learned senior counsel Dr. Abhishek M. Singhvi and Mr. C. Aryama Sundaram
appearing for the resolution applicant; learned senior counsel Mr. Vijay Narayan appearing for the
resolution professional; learned senior counsel, Mr. Mukul Rohatgi, Mr. K.V. Vishwanathan and Mr.
Dhruv Mehta as also learned counsel Ms. Haripriya Padmanabhan appearing for the respective
contesting parties. We have also heard learned senior counsel Mr. Rakesh Dwivedi appearing for
Edelweiss & associates and learned Solicitor General Mr. Tushar Mehta, appearing for SBI.
28. Learned senior counsel for the resolution applicant, Dr. Abhishek M. Singhvi, appearing in the
lead matter has emphatically argued against the impugned order while questioning the findings and
observations of the Appellate Tribunal with the following principal submissions: 28.1. As regards the
proposition of settlement put forward by the promoter with reference to Section 12-A of the Code, it
has been contended that the entitlement to file for withdrawal of the application admitted under
Section 7 of the Code would be restricted to TFCI i.e., the applicant who had filed the application,
with the approval of ninety per cent. voting share of the CoC and such an application for withdrawal
could have only been moved through the resolution professional. In the absence of any such move
by TFCI, the promoter did not have any right to move an application for withdrawal.
28.1.1. It has further been submitted that the letter of settlement dated 21.01.2021 was submitted
without proof of funds and there was no commitment towards funding in the proposal indicated in
the Deutsche Bank Indicative Term-Sheet dated 22.01.2021. Even the letter of support for funds
dated 14.07.2021 as issued by Saveetha Institute was withdrawn by a subsequent email dated
02.09.2021. Thereafter, in the eleventh CoC meeting dated 03.03.2022 that took place after the
passing of the impugned NCLAT judgment, respondent No. 1 relied upon the settlement proposal,
without placing any funds on the table in support thereof. This settlement proposal thus had been
nothing but an attempt to delay the CIRP proceedings as rightly observed by NCLT.
28.2. As regards the questions concerning eligibility of the appellant to act as resolution applicant, it
has been submitted by the learned senior counsel that Section 88 of the Trusts Act would not be

Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/146393726/
43
treated as a ground for disqualification of the appellant under Section 29-A of the Code. Although
the trust in question was held to be ineligible at the stage of EOI, the appellant was still held to be
eligible in his individual capacity. Thus, while the trust may be disqualified, the trustee, being a
separate entity, cannot be disqualified and the financial capability of the appellant was independent
of the trust money.
28.2.1. Learned senior counsel would submit that the appellant could not be held ineligible under
Section 29-A(e) of the Code, as the registrar of companies had not disqualified him under Section
164(2)(b) of the Companies Act for the alleged non-refunded deposit in the other company
International Aviation Academy Pvt. Ltd, in which the appellant was a director. Further, the DIN
status of the appellant was “active compliant” and NCLAT did not consider its own judgment in C.
Raja John v. R. Raghavendran and Ors.: Comp. Appl. (AT)(CH)(Ins) No. 207 of 2021 wherein it was
held that if DIN is activated, Section 29-A(e) of the Code will not be applicable.
28.2.2. This apart, it has also been submitted that since the issue of ineligibility was a mixed
question of fact and law, it could not have been raised before NCLAT for the first time, since there is
no concept of deemed disqualification under Section 164(2) of the Companies Act. 28.3. Coming to
the question of valuation of assets of the corporate debtor, learned senior counsel has submitted that
the resolution plan cannot be set aside on the basis of a contention that the valuation was lower than
the liquidation value. Reliance has been placed on the judgment in Maharashtra Seamless (supra) to
submit that the resolution plan would not be required to match the liquidation value. Learned
senior counsel would submit that members of CoC were provided with liquidation and fair value;
registered valuers were appointed for valuation of core and non-core assets; and these valuers
physically visited the properties for that purpose, in compliance of Regulation 35 of the CIRP
Regulations. Thereafter, the CoC approved this valuation in their commercial wisdom, following
which NCLT approved it as well, which cannot be second-guessed at a subsequent stage. It has also
been submitted that the question as to whether valuer was registered, was not required to be
adjudged since it was not in question before IBBI.
28.4. Learned senior counsel has also submitted that insofar as non- publication of Form-G on the
website is concerned, the issue was discussed during the fifth CoC meeting dated 12.11.2020 and the
CoC proceeded with the CIRP in its commercial wisdom after a detailed deliberation. Moreover, the
earlier judgment of NCLAT dated 05.05.2021 approving non-publication would act as res judicata.
Placing reliance on Kalpraj Dharamshi and Anr. v. Kotak Investment Advisors Limited and Anr.:
(2021) 10 SCC 401, it was submitted that non-publication of Form-G on the website cannot be
treated as a grave irregularity. 28.5. As regards the issue of not placing the revised final resolution
plan before the CoC, it has been submitted that the appellant had already complied with the
requirement of allocating the eligible amount to dissenting financial creditors in the event of
liquidation, as per the revised plan and there was no need to seek further approval of the CoC.
Moreover, in the tenth meeting, the CoC had granted a ‘deemed post facto approval’ to the revised
plan and had not objected to any of its portions in the affidavit filed before NCLAT dated
09.09.2021. Therefore, it cannot be said that the procedure adopted in the present case amounted to
a material irregularity. 28.6. Coming to the application filed by SBI for impleadment, learned senior
counsel would submit that SBI attended all meetings and voted in favour of the resolution plan, did
M.K. Rajagopalan vs Dr. Periasamy Palani Gounder on 3 May, 2023
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/146393726/
44
not raise any objection before the NCLT or NCLAT and is receiving 100% of its dues under the
resolution plan. Learned senior counsel has also referred to the judgment in EBIX Singapore Pvt.
Ltd. v. Committee of Creditors of Educomp Solutions Ltd. and Anr.: (2022) 2 SCC 401 to submit
that the resolution plan between a successful resolution applicant and the CoC would be binding.
Thus, being a part of CoC, SBI cannot subsequently raise a contrary stand to the stand taken by the
CoC.
28.7. On the aspect of commercial wisdom of the CoC, emphatic reliance has been placed on the
decisions of this Court in K. Sashidhar, Maharashtra Seamless, Essar Steel, Jaypee Kensington,
Kalpraj Dharamshi (supra); and Pratap Technocrats (P) Ltd. and Ors. v. Monitoring Committee of
Reliance Infratel Ltd and Anr.: 2021 SCC OnLine SC 569 to submit that scope of interference in
matters concerning the successful resolution plan is extremely narrow, and the challenge is only
limited to matters ‘other than’ enquiry into the autonomy or commercial wisdom of the CoC as
under Section 30(2) or 61(3) of the IBC. In the case at hand, since the resolution plan had been
approved by the CoC there would be no case for any interference.
28.8. It has also been submitted on behalf of the resolution applicant that the CIRP had reached an
advanced stage, resolution applicant had given a bank guarantee of Rs. 25 crore on 01.02.2021 in
pursuance of approved resolution plan, the initial amount of Rs. 150 crore, which was required to be
remitted within 45 days of the approval of the resolution plan, was deposited within 15 days and the
resolution applicant has always been ready with the remaining funds. It has also been vehemently
submitted that deliberate dilatory tactics have been adopted by the promoter to frustrate the process
of CIRP, with substantial amount of time having been lost on account of the delays.
28.9. As regards the application bearing IA No. 168602 of 2022 in Civil Appeal Nos. 1682-1683 of
2022 filed by the promoter and erstwhile director of the corporate debtor - seeking permission to
bring on record subsequent facts that during the pendency of these appeals his proposal of
settlement under Section 12-A of the Code was passed by CoC in its nineteenth meeting held on
12.10.2022 by 100% voting power of members - learned counsel for resolution applicant has
submitted that the very consideration of Section 12-A application of the promoter by CoC had been
against the explicit direction of the Appellate Tribunal in the order dated 17.02.2022, whereby only
15 days’ time was allowed to the CoC to examine the pending or existing Section12-A proposal of the
promoter; and such a proposal was indeed rejected by the CoC on 25.03.2022. Therefore, the only
course available with CoC after such rejection was to continue with the fresh CIRP; and the CoC had
no legal authority to consider or vote on a new settlement proposal of the promoter after issuance of
fresh Form G. Learned counsel would submit that the direction of the Appellate Tribunal as regards
consideration of Section 12-A proposal of the promoter was exhausted when the settlement proposal
was rejected by CoC in its eleventh meeting on 25.03.2022 and a fresh Section 12-A application
could not have been entertained by the CoC in any case.
29. On another aspect, in CA No. 1827 of 2022, learned senior counsel for the appellant, Mr. C.
Aryama Sundaram, appearing against Dharani Finance (the related party), has relied on various
decisions of this Court including those in Phoenix ARC, Pratap Technocrats, and Kalpraj Dharamshi
(supra) as also in Facor Alloys Ltd. v. Bhuvan Madan and Ors.: Civil Appeal No. 5129 of 2021 to
M.K. Rajagopalan vs Dr. Periasamy Palani Gounder on 3 May, 2023
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/146393726/
45
submit that even though the resolution applicant has admitted certain dues towards related parties,
the final resolution plan did not provide for any payment and the plan was upheld by this Court in
these cases. On previous occasions, this Court as well as other fora had differentiated between
related and non-related parties under resolution plans. Learned senior counsel would argue against
the proposition that a related party could be part of the CoC when it is a financial creditor. Further,
it has been submitted that Article 14 of the Constitution in stricto sensu would not be applicable to
the decision of the CoC, as it is not a ‘State’ as defined under Article 12 of the Constitution.
30. Learned senior counsel Mr. Vijay Narayan appearing on behalf of the resolution professional has
mainly questioned the findings and observations in the order impugned as regards the process
adopted and steps taken by RP and has made a variety of submissions as follows: 30.1. As regards
the question of valuation, it has been submitted that the only responsibility of RP under Regulation
35(2) of the CIRP Regulations has been to share the fair value and liquidation value with the
members of CoC after obtaining a confidentiality undertaking, which was done in the present case.
There is no requirement to provide a copy of the report to the CoC or any other stakeholder. On the
contention of valuation under the Companies (Valuation) Rules of 2017, it has been submitted that
the interim resolution professional appointed three sets of valuers for the three main classes of
assets.
30.1.1. With respect to the physical valuation of assets, learned senior counsel emphasised on
agenda item No. 4 of the fourth CoC meeting, wherein it was clearly mentioned that the valuers
visited the property of the corporate debtor.
30.1.2. Insofar as the issue of non-core assets not being valued is concerned, it was submitted on
behalf of RP that although the value of non- core assets was fairly insignificant, in the seventh CoC
meeting dated 29.12.2020, the RP informed that the second valuer Mr. G Vaidya Ramana, visited
the premises for non-core assets and had subsequently submitted his report. The statement
containing the said reports was placed before the Tribunal. It has, thus, been submitted that it was
incorrect for the Tribunal to render a finding that the valuation of non-core assets had not been
done in the present case.
30.2. As regards non-publication of Form-G on the website, it has been argued that the same was
published in all leading newspapers on 09.08.2020 and the then IRP had emailed IBBI to intimate
them that there was some technical issue in uploading the said form on the website, with a request
to upload the same. Thus, all the requisite steps having been reasonably taken, the process that had
reached an advanced stage could not have been annulled on such a technicality.
30.3. Further, while dealing with the issue of not placing the revised resolution plan before the CoC,
reliance has been placed on the ninth CoC meeting dated 22.01.2021 with the submissions that the
resolution plan was approved with 87.39% of the total voting share and the resolution applicant was
only required to provide for redistribution to ensure that the dissenting financial creditors were
given their share in terms of Section 30(2)(b) of the Code. Pursuant to this, the resolution applicant
submitted the modified resolution plan in which the allocation for the unsecured dissenting
financial creditors was revised from 29 crore to 49.13 crore. The revised plan was then placed before
M.K. Rajagopalan vs Dr. Periasamy Palani Gounder on 3 May, 2023
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/146393726/
46
the Coc in the tenth CoC meeting and no objections were raised at that time.
30.4. It has also been submitted that the settlement proposal put forth by the corporate debtor was
not in consonance with the mandate specified under Regulation 30-A of the CIRP regulations read
with Section 12-A of IBC.
30.5. On the issue of increase in the fee of RP which was not raised before the NCLT and was only
raised before the NCLAT, it has been submitted that the request for revision of fee had indeed been
made with reasons for said revision, much prior to the date on which the resolution plan was
approved by the CoC.
30.6. It has also been submitted that the issue of ineligibility of the resolution applicant was not
raised before NCLT but, NCLAT in its impugned order, has held him ineligible. In this regard, the
RP could have only carried out public domain search and take into account the affidavit of
compliance submitted by resolution applicant in view of Regulation 39 of the CIRP Regulations.
30.7. Coming to the allegation by Dharani Finance regarding discriminatory treatment for being a
related party creditor, it has been submitted that there is a need only to ensure that the plan
provides for payment to financial creditors (including dissenting financial creditors) entitled to vote.
Placing reliance on Section 30(2)(b)(ii), Section 21 and Regulation 38(1), it has been argued that the
approved plan is in accordance with the Code and the Regulations.
30.8. In closing, it has been argued by the learned senior counsel for the resolution professional that
he has preferred applications against the promoter-director of the corporate debtor under Section
43 of the Code seeking avoidance of certain transactions which are preferential in nature. The said
applications are pending before the NCLT for adjudication. With regard to these avoidance
applications, however, reliance on a judgement of the Delhi High Court in Venus Recruiters Private
Limited v. Union of India and Ors.: 2020 SCC Online Del. 1479 is of no avail as in the said case, the
High Court has examined the jurisdiction of the Adjudicating Authority to entertain an application
under Section 43 after the approval of the resolution plan.
31. Learned senior counsel Mr. Mukul Rohatgi appearing on behalf of Dr. Perisamy Palani Gounder
(promoter and erstwhile director), has supported the order impugned while contesting the
submissions made on behalf of the appellant.
31.1. Learned senior counsel has submitted that the CoC approved the resolution plan in question
without considering the settlement proposals put forth by the promoter under the letters dated
21.01.2021 and 08.03.2021, for settling with all creditors and for withdrawal of CIRP under Section
12- A of the Code. While placing reliance on the decision of this Court in Swiss Ribbons (P) Ltd. and
Anr. v. Union of India and Ors.: (2019) 4 SCC 17, it has been submitted that the promoter’s
proposals were not even placed as agenda items and hence, the CoC had not been given an
opportunity to properly consider the corporate debtor as a going concern; rather CIRP was
converted into a mere debt recovery process by ignoring other creditors and shareholders. It has
been argued that the contesting promoter has been putting forth sincere efforts to preserve the
M.K. Rajagopalan vs Dr. Periasamy Palani Gounder on 3 May, 2023
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/146393726/
47
corporate debtor as a going concern but his genuine efforts were sought to be frustrated by hasty
and illegally conducted CIRP and thereby, the approved resolution plan was essentially giving away
the substantial assets of the corporate debtor at a highly undervalued price. Thus, the decision of the
Appellate Tribunal in this case is correct on law as also on facts. 31.2. It has also been vehemently
argued that the resolution plan in question is contrary to law, as it clearly violates the underlying
principles of Section 88 of the Trusts Act and Section 164(2)(b) of the Companies Act, 2013. The
main plank of submissions with respect to violation of Section 88 of the Trusts Act has been that
there is a conflict of interest, as the appellant is competing in his capacity as an individual with
interests of a trust in which he was the founding managing trustee. Further, it has already been
ruled by the resolution professional that the said trust Sri Balaji Vidyapeeth was ineligible to be a
resolution applicant due to its status as a charitable trust and a non-profit making entity. In the face
of these facts, the appellant simultaneously submitting a resolution plan in his individual capacity by
taking support from financial credentials of the same trust, basically sought to achieve indirectly
which he could not directly. Furthermore, the fact that the trust was a prospective resolution
applicant and was found to be ineligible was a fact suppressed from the knowledge of the COC.
31.2.1. It has also been submitted that the resolution applicant’s plan to convert Coimbatore
property into Hospital would directly result in a conflict of interest and breach of fiduciary duties
owed by him as managing director of the company MGM Healthcare Private Limited. This,
according to the learned counsel would be in direct violation of Section 166(4) of the Companies Act
which prohibits a director of the company from involving himself in a situation in which he may
have direct or indirect interest that conflicts or possibly may conflict, with the interest of the
company. For this reason too, the resolution plan in question is contrary to law and cannot pass
muster under Section 30(2)(e) of the Code.
31.2.2. Another argument by the learned senior counsel on behalf of promoter has been that the
appellant is not eligible to submit a resolution plan under Section 29A(e) of the Code. It has been
argued that the resolution applicant has been the director of a company named 'International
Aviation Academy Private Limited'; and as per the audited financial statements of the said company
for 2010-2011 to 2017-2018, there was evidence that Rs. 12,03,000 had been collected as "share
application money pending allotment” and had not been refunded. This would result in the same
being treated as an “unrefunded deposit” within the meaning of the proviso to Explanation (A) of
Rule 2(1)(c)(viii) of the Companies (Acceptance of Deposits) Rules, 2014 and result in
disqualification of the appellant-resolution applicant, from being a director under Section 164(2)(b)
of the Companies Act and, consequently, from being a resolution applicant in the CIRP in question.
31.3. It has also been submitted that the assets of the corporate debtor were grossly undervalued in
the final resolution plan whereby, the assets worth more than Rs. 1600 crore were sought to be
transferred only for a sum of about Rs. 423 crore. In order to support this line of argument, reliance
has been placed on Regulation 35(1) and 35(2) of the CIRP Regulations. Regulation 35(1) provides
that two registered valuers must submit an estimate of the ‘fair value’ and ‘liquidation value’ of the
corporate debtor after physical verification to the resolution professional, and Regulation 35(2)
requires the resolution professional to provide the aforesaid valuation to every member of the CoC.
M.K. Rajagopalan vs Dr. Periasamy Palani Gounder on 3 May, 2023
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/146393726/
48
31.3.1. It has been argued that in the present case, there was no physical verification because the
appointed registered valuers were based in Delhi and sought to delegate the process of physical
verification to their associates in Tamil Nadu. Concerns regarding this were also highlighted in the
second CoC meeting dated 06.08.2020. Further, it has been submitted that the valuation of the
non-core assets was carried out irregularly and not in accordance with Regulation 35 of the CIRP
Regulations. In addition, only bare valuation figures were shared and the valuation reports were not
furnished to the erstwhile directors and the members of CoC. Thus, according to the learned senior
counsel, it was rightly noticed by NCLAT that mere production of the naked value of assets without
detailed adjoining report would handicap the commercial wisdom of the CoC. Reliance has also been
placed on the seventh CoC meeting to submit that the concern of resolution plan not reflecting true
value of the corporate debtor was expressed by the CoC members. It has also been submitted that
the resolution professional under the pretext of maintaining the corporate debtor as a going
concern, has allowed approval of an illegal resolution plan that hands over assets of the Corporate
Debtor at severe undervaluation.
31.3.2. Further, it has been contended that the decision in Maharashtra Seamless (supra) would not
be relevant to the present case because it does not refer to a situation in which the determination of
fair value and liquidation value is done in an illegal manner and in a way that grossly undervalues
the assets of the corporate debtor. In the present case, the total debt of the corporate debtor is much
lower than the liquidation value of its assets. This apart, according to the learned counsel, the
proposition concerning the application of principles of res judicata remains wholly misplaced since
the said proceedings in NCLAT were at the instance of a different party and the principal issue in the
previous litigation had nothing to do with the resolution plan, or statutory violations in the CIRP.
31.4. Dealing with the issue of non-publication of Form G on the website, it has been submitted that
Regulation 36A(2)(iii) of the CIRP Regulations, which mandates the publication on the website of
IBBI and the website of corporate debtor has been violated as it has been an admitted position that
the same was not done by the resolution professional. The actions of the resolution professional,
therefore, had been in violation of Regulation 36A and Circular Bearing No. IP (CIRP)/006/2018
dated 23.02.2018. The resolution professional has claimed that the form could not be uploaded for
technical reasons but has failed to explain the steps taken to rectify this deficiency in the CIRP.
31.5. Coming to the issue of not placing the final resolution plan before the CoC, it has been
submitted, with reference to the minutes of the ninth CoC meeting dated 22.01.2021, that when the
resolution plan was put to vote, there was a requirement for the resolution professional to send the
plan back to the resolution applicant to comply with Section 30(2) IBC. However, after this, the
revised plan was directly placed before the NCLT and not before the CoC which stands in violation
of Sections 30(2), 30(4), 30(6) and 31 of the Code. Further, it has also been contended that Section
31 of the Code does not envisage any post facto ratification of a resolution plan.
31.6. With reference to the application to bring on record the subsequent event of acceptance of his
settlement proposal under Section 12-A IBC by CoC with 100% voting powers of the members in its
nineteenth meeting, placing reliance on Section 12-A and Regulation 30-A of CIRP Regulations,
learned counsel has submitted that there is neither any bar on the submission of multiple settlement
proposals for withdrawal under the said Section nor a cut-off date within which the proposal has to

Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/146393726/
49
be made during the CIRP. He would also argue that the application under Section 12-A styled as
'withdrawal' also calls into play the principle that the creditors are dominus litis in an insolvency
proceeding and they have the right to withdraw a proceeding subject to approval by the Adjudicating
Authority. 31.7. Learned counsel for promoter would also contend that the resolution applicant has
no vested right to have his plan accepted and implemented under the provisions of the Code. In
response to the argument of the resolution applicant that resolution applicant had deposited Rs. 150
crore which has not been returned, learned counsel for the promoter has submitted that during the
eleventh CoC meeting, on the question of the promoter, the resolution professional replied that the
process was between him and the resolution applicant and some procedural issues were to be
addressed whereafter, the deposited money would be returned.
32. Learned senior counsel Mr. K.V. Vishwanathan, also appearing for the promoter, has
re-emphasised that the revised plan was never put to vote and that there was duty of valuers to
physically valuate the assets which they did not carry out. This apart, it has also been argued that the
shareholders would not have the requisite locus to intervene in the CIRP process, by placing reliance
on the decision of this Court in Jaypee Kensington (supra).
33. Mr. Dhruv Mehta, learned senior counsel appearing for the other promoter and erstwhile
director Dr. V. Janakiraman has made largely the similar submissions, relying on the minutes of the
ninth CoC meeting that there was a violation of Section 30(4) and 30(6) of IBC. Learned senior
counsel has further referred to the judgment in Essar Steel (supra) to emphasise on the point that
the revised resolution plan was never placed before the CoC and hence, the entire process stands
vitiated.
34. Learned counsel for Dharani Finance, Ms. Haripriya Padmanabhan has primarily argued against
the treatment of related parties as a separate class for payment of dues under the resolution plan. It
has been submitted that Dharani Finance is a non-banking financial institution, listed in Bombay
Stock Exchange. In this case, it is a financial creditor and an operational creditor of the corporate
debtor and even though its claims of Rs. 1,94,14,024 and Rs. 4,81,62,175, of operational debt and
financial debt respectively, were duly admitted, it was not paid anything under the resolution plan
for being a related party. While placing reliance on the judgment in Phoenix ARC (supra), it has
been argued that this Court has laid down the reasons for treating related parties as a separate class,
and held that related parties should be excluded from the CoC so that they do not interfere with the
resolution process. The rationale behind this has been achieved by not allowing related parties to
present the resolution plans or to become a part of the CoC. However, there is no reason for them to
be treated as a separate class when it comes to payment of dues under the approved resolution plan.
Further, it has been contended that the resolution professional in this case undertook a hasty
process, without adjudicating on all the claims received by it.
34.1. Relying on the seventh and eighth CoC meetings, it has been submitted that there was a certain
amount set apart for related parties, however, in the final resolution plan, there was no amount
stated to be paid to the related parties and there had not been any discussion in the CoC in this
regard. Thus, for Dharani Finance being an operational and a financial creditor, the failure to
provide for discharge of its debt in the final resolution plan, is in violation of Sections 30(2)(b), (e)
M.K. Rajagopalan vs Dr. Periasamy Palani Gounder on 3 May, 2023
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/146393726/
50
and (f) of the Code. It has been strenuously argued that at the very least, CoC must discuss whether
Dharani Finance is to be repaid, which has not been done.
35. Learned Solicitor General of India Mr. Tushar Mehta, appearing for SBI, has submitted that this
financial creditor has a voting share of about 26% in the CoC with an admitted claim of Rs. 102.88
crore. As a matter of record, it has been accepted that SBI approved the resolution plan of Rs. 423
crore submitted by the resolution applicant within 87.39% of the voting share in CoC. It is submitted
that the topmost priority of SBI is that the CIRP be decided in a definite time frame given that nearly
2 years have elapsed and further delay would cause deterioration in the asset value. Since the CoC
had already taken steps in furtherance of the impugned order dated 17.02.2022, it has been prayed
that the CoC be allowed to continue with the CIRP from the stage of fresh issuance of Form G;
consideration of proposal under Section 12-A of the Code and also determine eligibility of appellant,
on independent footing, uninfluenced by the observations of the NCLAT.
35.1. In regard to the fresh proceedings during the pendency of these appeals (as noticed above), it
has been submitted on behalf of SBI that after being given further opportunity, the promoter
re-submitted the settlement proposal under Section 12-A IBC with deposit of upfront amount of Rs.
105 crore and a Bank Guarantee of Rs. 325 crore; and on being put to vote, this settlement proposal
was approved by 100% voting share in the CoC which deserves to be taken forward. Learned SG has
relied on the decisions of this Court in Vallal RCK v. Siva Industries and Holdings Ltd. and Ors.:
2022 SCC OnLine SC 717 and Brilliant Alloys (P) Ltd. v. S. Rajagopal and Ors.: (2022) 2 SCC 544.
36. Appearing for Edelweiss and associates, learned senior counsel Mr. Rakesh Dwivedi has
submitted that these financial creditors of the corporate debtor with total of about 21.13% voting
share in CoC, too had voted in favour of the resolution plan in question; and the plan so approved
with 87.39% of the voting share in CoC could not have been lightly interfered with. The learned
counsel has contended that merely for non- consideration of revised resolution plan, which was
revised at the instance of CoC itself, the approval could not have been set aside overriding the
commercial wisdom of CoC. It has also been submitted that the promoters’ earlier proposition with
reference to Section 12-A of the Code was wholly ambiguous and could not have been countenanced
in the manner presented before CoC or even before NCLAT. While referring to certain other areas of
concern including the amount deposited by the resolution applicant, it has been suggested on behalf
of these financial creditors that CIRP must be allowed to go on while leaving promoter a right to
propose a better resolution plan by way of a Swiss Challenge Process; and for that purpose, he
should be made to deposit at least a sum of Rs. 471.70 crore in an escrow account prior to the voting
on his settlement offer. Points for determination
37. For what has been noticed hereinabove and looking to the overall scenario, the following
principal points arise for determination in this batch of appeals:
A. Whether the valuation process of the assets of the corporate debtor had been in violation of the
Regulations 27 and 35 of the CIRP Regulations and thereby, approval of the resolution plan had
been in contravention of Sections 30(2) and 61(3) of the Code?

B. Whether there had been non-compliance of Regulation 36-A(2)(iii) of the CIRP Regulations for
want of publication of Form G on the designated website not later than 75th day from the insolvency
commencement date; and failure to advertise as mandated had a direct impact on the maximization
of asset value, particularly when the entire CIRP was conducted during lockdown at the time of
Covid-19 pandemic?
C1. Whether the resolution applicant is ineligible to submit a resolution plan in terms of Section
29-A(e) of the Code for being disqualified to act as a director under Section 164(2)(b) of the
Companies Act?
C2. Whether the resolution applicant is ineligible to submit a resolution plan so as to act as alter ego
of the trust “Sri Balaji Vidyapeeth” that had already been declared ineligible; and submission of plan
by resolution applicant is barred by virtue of Section 88 of the Trusts Act?
C3. Whether the resolution plan in question leads to violation of Section 166(4) of the Companies
Act and hence, cannot be approved in terms of Section 30(2)(e) of the Code?
D1. Whether the Appellate Tribunal has erred in holding that the resolution plan in question, which
was placed before the Adjudicating Authority for approval, was void and non-est in law because in
the ninth CoC meeting dated 22.01.2021, the resolution plan was sent back to the resolution
applicant for further revision; and the revised resolution plan thereafter submitted by the resolution
applicant on 25.01.2021 was directly filed before the Adjudicating Authority without being put to
vote before CoC? D2. Whether the Appellate Tribunal has erred in making observations against
increase of the fees of the resolution professional and assuming the possibility of its impact on his
decision to submit the resolution plan before the Adjudicating Authority without approval of CoC?
E. Whether the Appellate Tribunal has erred in applying the principles of non-discrimination in
relation to related party of corporate debtor and thereby holding against the resolution plan in
question for want of provision for related party?
F. Whether the Appellate Tribunal has erred in holding that settlement offer of the promoter in
terms of Section 12-A of the Code was not placed for consideration of CoC; and as to whether
non-consideration of such a proposal has any bearing on the question of approval of the resolution
plan in question? G. What is the impact and effect of the subsequent events, particularly of the
approval of settlement offer of the promoter by the CoC in its nineteenth meeting held on
12.10.2022 by 100% majority of the voting share?
Relevant statutory provisions
38. We have taken note of the parties and their respective positions; the relevant factual and
background aspects that have led to the present set of appeals, including various meetings of the
CoC and other events that occurred during the CIRP; the impugned orders of the NCLT and NCLAT
dated 15.07.2021 and 17.02.2022 respectively; and the principal points to be determined in these
appeals. Before proceeding further, worthwhile it would be to take note of the statutory provisions,

*** *** ***” Objectives and scheme of IBC: crucial role-players:
39. For dealing with the questions involved, at the outset, a brief reference to the scheme of the
Code, as noticed from its Preamble and as exposited by this Court need to be taken note of. The
Preamble of the Code reads as under: -
“An Act to consolidate and amend the laws relating to reorganisation and insolvency
resolution of corporate persons, partnership firms and individuals in a time bound
manner for maximisation of value of assets of such persons, to promote
entrepreneurship, availability of credit and balance the interests of all the
stakeholders including alteration in the order of priority of payment of Government
dues and to establish an Insolvency and Bankruptcy Board of India, and for matters
connected therewith or incidental thereto.” 39.1. In the case of Swiss Ribbons
(supra), this Court traversed through the historical background and scheme of the
Code in sufficient detail and while pointing out that the Code was a beneficial
legislation to put the corporate debtor on its feet and not a mere recovery legislation
for the creditors, said as under: -
“27. As is discernible, the Preamble gives an insight into what is sought to be
achieved by the Code. The Code is first and foremost, a Code for reorganisation and
insolvency resolution of corporate 85 Ins. by Act 1 of 2018, sec. 52(i) [w.e.f. 7-5-2018,
vide S.O. 1833(E), dated 7th May, 2018].
debtors. Unless such reorganisation is effected in a time-bound manner, the value of
the assets of such persons will deplete. Therefore, maximisation of value of the assets
of such persons so that they are efficiently run as going concerns is another very
important objective of the Code. This, in turn, will promote entrepreneurship as the
persons in management of the corporate debtor are removed and replaced by

75
entrepreneurs. When, therefore, a resolution plan takes off and the corporate debtor
is brought back into the economic mainstream, it is able to repay its debts, which, in
turn, enhances the viabilityof credit in the hands of banks and financial institutions.
Above all, ultimately, the interests of all stakeholders are looked after as the
corporate debtor itself becomes a beneficiary of the resolution scheme—workers are
paid, the creditors in the long run will be repaid in full, and shareholders/investors
are able to maximise their investment. Timely resolution of a corporate debtor who is
in the red, by an effective legal framework, would go a long way to support the
development of credit markets. Since more investment can be made with funds that
have come back into the economy, business then eases up, which leads, overall, to
higher economic growthand development of the Indian economy.
What is interesting to note is that the Preamble does not, in any manner, refer to liquidation, which
is only availed of as a last resort if there is either no resolution plan or the resolution plans
submitted are not up to the mark. Even in liquidation, the liquidator can sell the business of the
corporate debtor as a going concern. (See ArcelorMittal [ArcelorMittal (India) (P) Ltd. v. Satish
Kumar Gupta & Ors: (2019) 2 SCC 1] at para 83, fn 3)
28. It can thus be seen that the primary focus of the legislation is to ensure revival and continuation
of the corporate debtor by protecting the corporate debtor from its own management and from a
corporate death by liquidation. The Code is thus a beneficial legislation which puts the corporate
debtor back on its feet, not being a mere recovery legislation for creditors. The interests of the
corporate debtor have, therefore, been bifurcated and separated from that of its promoters/those
who are in management. Thus, the resolution process is not adversarial to the corporate debtor but,
in fact,protective of its interests…..” (emphasis in bold supplied) 39.2. As regards to the process of
insolvency resolution, while dealing with various provisions of Chapter II of Part II of the Code, this
Court in the case of Essar Steel (supra) summed up the key role of resolution professional in the
following terms: -
“48. The detailed provisions that have been stated hereinabove make it clear that the resolution
professional is a person who is not only to manage the affairs of the corporate debtor as a going
concern from the stage of admission of an application under Sections 7, 9 or 10 of the Code till a
resolution plan is approved by the Adjudicating Authority, but is also a key person who is to appoint
and convene meetings of the Committee of Creditors, so that they may decide upon resolution plans
that are submitted in accordance with the detailed information given to resolution applicants by the
resolution professional. Another very important function of the resolution professional is to collect,
collate and finally admit claims of all creditors, which must then be examined for payment, in full or
in part or not at all, by the resolution applicant and be finally negotiated and decided by the
Committee of Creditors.” 39.3. In the case of Jaypee Kensington (supra), after taking note of the
roles and duties of the resolution professional and the resolution applicant, this Court underscored
the crucial role of committee of creditors in the entire CIRP with reference to several past decisions.
Rather than any other discussion, we deem it appropriate to reproduce the relevant passages therein
as under: -

“Committee of Creditors: the protagonist of CIRP
97. While in their representative roles, the resolution professional and the resolution
applicant are duty-bound to ensure that the resolution plan is prepared in conformity
with the requirements of the Code and the CIRP Regulations and is properly
presented for consideration, the central role in taking the decision as to whether a
resolution plan be adopted or not, in the same form as presented to it or in a
modified form; and as to whether the attempt for revival of corporate debtor be made
or not, ultimately rests with the pivotal body, comprising of the financial creditors of
the corporate debtor and termed as “Committee of Creditors”. As noticed from the
provisions above quoted, the final decision on a resolution plan is taken by the
Committee of Creditors; and, for approval, a resolution plan is required to be voted in
favour by not less than 66% of the voting share of the financial creditors, as per
Section 30(4) of the Code. It is also relevant to point out that though the resolution
professional is to run the business of the corporate debtor as a going concern during
the corporate insolvency resolution process but, as per Section 28(3) of the Code, he
cannot take certain decisions relating to the management of the corporate debtor
without prior approval of the Committee of Creditors by a vote of at least 66% of the
voting shares86.
97.1. It is, therefore, evident that corporate insolvency resolution, with approval of
the plan of resolution, is ultimately in the exclusive domain of the Committee of
Creditors. Even during the resolution process, major decisions as regards
management and finances of the corporate debtor are in the control of the Committee
of Creditors. As per the composition delineated in Section 21 of the Code, the
Committee of Creditors is comprised of all financial creditors of the corporate debtor;
and the frame of Section 21 puts it beyond doubt that the voting share of each
financial creditor is determined on the basis of financial debt owed to it. It is also
clear from Section 30(4) as also Section 28(3) that the major decisions of approval
are to be taken by the Committee of Creditors by a vote of at least 66% of the voting
share of the financial creditors and not by a simple majority. The reasons and
purpose for assigning such a unique and decisive role in corporate insolvency
resolution to the Committee of Creditors and for that matter, to a substantial block of
not less than 2/3rd of voting share of the financial creditors, were extensively
delineated in the report of the Bankruptcy Law Reforms Committee of November
2015 while remarking on the essential theme that the “appropriate disposition of a
defaulting firm is a business decision, and only the creditors should make it”. 97.2. In
K. Sashidhar, while setting out the relevant extracts from the said Report, this Court
exposited on the primacy of the commercial wisdom of the Committee of Creditors in
the corporate insolvency resolution process in the following terms: (SCC pp. 183-
84, paras 52-53) “52. As aforesaid, upon receipt of a “rejected” resolution plan the adjudicating
authority (NCLT) is not expected to do anything more; but is obligated to initiate liquidation process
under Section 33(1) of the I&B Code. The legislature has not endowed the adjudicating authority

77
(NCLT) with the jurisdiction or authority to analyse or evaluate the commercial decision of CoC
much less to enquire into the justness of the rejection of the resolution plan by the dissenting
financial creditors. From the legislative history and the background in which the I&B Code has been
enacted, it is noticed that a completely new approach has been adopted for speeding up the recovery
of the debt due from the defaulting companies. In the new approach, there is a calm period followed
by a swift resolution process to be completed within 270 days (outer limit) failing which, initiation
of liquidation process has been made inevitable and mandatory. In the earlier regime, the corporate
debtor could indefinitely continue to enjoy the This percentage of minimum votes of CoC, for
approval of resolution plan as also for prior approval of certain actions, was “seventy-five” in the
Code as originally enacted and was altered to “sixty-six” by way of an amendment with effect from
6-6-2018. protection given under Section 22 of the Sick Industrial Companies Act, 1985 or under
other such enactments which has now been forsaken. Besides, the commercial wisdom of CoC has
been given paramount status without any judicial intervention, for ensuring completion of the
stated processes within the timelines prescribed by the I&B Code. There is an intrinsic assumption
that financial creditors are fully informed about the viability of the corporate debtor and feasibility
of the proposed resolution plan. They act on the basis of thorough examination of the proposed
resolution plan and assessment made by their team of experts. The opinion on the subject-matter
expressed by them after due deliberations in CoC meetings through voting, as per voting shares, is a
collective business decision. The legislature, consciously, has not provided any ground to challenge
the “commercial wisdom” of the individual financial creditors or their collective decision before the
adjudicating authority. That is made non-justiciable.
53. In the report of the Bankruptcy Law Reforms Committee of November 2015, primacy has been
given to CoC to evaluate the various possibilities and make a decision. It has been observed thus:
“The key economic question in the bankruptcy process When a firm (referred to as the corporate
debtor in the draft law) defaults, the question arises about what is to be done. Many possibilities can
be envisioned. One possibility is to take the firm into liquidation. Another possibility is to negotiate
a debt restructuring, where the creditors accept a reduction of debt on an NPV basis, and hope that
the negotiated value exceeds the liquidation value. Another possibility is to sell the firm as a going
concern and use the proceeds to pay creditors. Many hybrid structures of these broad categories can
be envisioned.
The Committee believes that there is only one correct forum for evaluating such possibilities, and
making a decision : a creditors committee, where all financial creditors have votes in proportion to
the magnitude of debt that they hold. In the past, laws in India have brought arms of the
Government (legislature, executive or judiciary) into this question. This has been strictly avoided by
the Committee. The appropriate disposition of a defaulting firm is a business decision, and only the
creditors should make it.
(emphasis in bold supplied; emphasis in italics is in original) 97.3. In Essar Steel, a three-Judge
Bench of this Court surveyed almost all the relevant provisions concerning corporate insolvency
resolution process; and, as noticed above, explained the assignments of different role players in this
process. In that context, this Court again explained the primacy endowed on the commercial

78
wisdom of the Committee of Creditors and reasons therefor, with a further detailed reference to the
aforesaid report of the Bankruptcy Law Reforms Committee of November 2015. Apart from the
passage from the said report that was noticed in K.
Sashidhar (reproduced hereinabove), the Court noticed various other passages from this report in
Essar Steel; and one part thereof, which further underscores the rationale for only financial
creditors handling the process of resolution, could be usefully reproduced as under (part of para 56
at pp. 578-79 of SCC):
“56. … 5.3.1. Steps at the start of the IRP ***
4. Creation of the creditors committee The creditors committee will have the power to decide the
final solution by majority vote in the negotiations. The majority vote requires more than or equal to
75% of the creditors committee by weight of the total financial liabilities. The majority vote will also
involve a cram down option on any dissenting creditors once the majority vote is obtained. … The
Committee deliberated on who should be on the creditors committee, given the power of the
creditors committee to ultimately keep the entity as a going concern or liquidate it. The Committee
reasoned that members of the creditors committee have to be creditors both with the capability to
assess viability, as well as to be willing to modify terms of existing liabilities in negotiations.
Typically, operational creditors are neither able to decide on matters regarding the insolvency of the
entity, nor willing to take the risk of postponing payments for better future prospects for the entity.
The Committee concluded that, for the process to be rapid and efficient, the Code will provide that
the creditors committee should be restricted to only the financial creditors.” (emphasis in italics is in
original) 97.4. In Essar Steel, the Court referred to the above-quoted and other passages from the
judgment in K. Sashidhar (supra) and explained the decisive role of the commercial wisdom of the
Committee of Creditors, inter alia, in the following passages: “54. Since it is the commercial wisdom
of the Committee of Creditors that is to decide on whether or not to rehabilitate the corporate debtor
by means of acceptance of a particular resolution plan, the provisions of the Code and the
Regulations outline in detail the importance of setting up of such Committee, and leaving decisions
to be made by the requisite majority of the members of the aforesaid Committee in its discretion. …
*** *** ***
59. Even though it is the resolution professional who is to run the business of the corporate debtor
as a going concern during the intermediate period, yet, such resolution professional cannot take
certain decisions relating to management of the corporate debtor without the prior approval of at
least 66% of the votes of the Committee of Creditors. …
60. Thus, it is clear that since corporate resolution is ultimately in the hands of the majority vote of
the Committee of Creditors, nothing can be done qua the management of the corporate debtor by
the resolution professional which impacts major decisions to be made in the interregnum between
the taking over of management of the corporate debtor and corporate resolution by the acceptance
of a resolution plan by the requisite majority of the Committee of Creditors. Most importantly,
under Section 30(4), the Committee of Creditors may approve a resolution plan by a vote of not less
than 66% of the voting share of the financial creditors, after considering its feasibility and viability,

Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/146393726/
79
and various other requirements as may be prescribed by the Regulations.
*** *** ***
64. Thus, what is left to the majority decision of the Committee of Creditors is the “feasibility and
viability” of a resolution plan, which obviously takes into account all aspects of the plan, including
the manner of distribution of funds among the various classes of creditors. As an example, take the
case of a resolution plan which does not provide for payment of electricity dues. It is certainly open
to the Committee of Creditors to suggest a modification to the prospective resolution applicant to
the effect that such dues ought to be paid in full, so that the carrying on of the business of the
corporate debtor does not become impossible for want of a most basic and essential element for the
carrying on of such business, namely, electricity. This may, in turn, be accepted by the resolution
applicant with a consequent modification as to distribution of funds, payment being provided to a
certain type of operational creditor, namely, the electricity distribution company, out of upfront
payment offered by the proposed resolution applicant which may also result in a consequent
reduction of amounts payable to other financial and operational creditors. What is important is that
it is the commercial wisdom of this majority of creditors which is to determine, through negotiation
with the prospective resolution applicant, as to how and in what manner the corporate resolution
process is to take place.” (emphasis in bold supplied) 97.5. In Maharashtra Seamless Ltd. (supra),
again, a three-Judge Bench of this Court referred extensively to the enunciations in Essar Steel and
reiterated the primacy assigned to the commercial wisdom of the Committee of Creditors in the
matter of corporate insolvency resolution.
98. For what has been noticed hereinabove, it would not be an exaggeration in terms that, in
corporate insolvency resolution process, the role of Committee of Creditors is akin to that of a
protagonist, giving finality to the process (subject, of course, to approval by the adjudicating
authority), who takes the key decisions in its commercial wisdom and also takes the consequences
thereof. As noticed, the process is aimed at bringing the corporate debtor back on its feet and it is
acknowledged that appropriate disposition of a defaulting corporate debtor and the choice of
solution, to keep the corporate debtor as a going concern or to liquidate it, is to be made by the
financial creditors, who could assess the viability and may take decisions in modification of the
terms of the existing liabilities. In other words, the decision as to whether the corporate debtor be
resurrected or not, by acceptance of a particular resolution plan, is essentially a business decision
and hence, is left to the committee consisting of the financial creditors, that is, the Committee of
Creditors but, with the requirement that the resolution plan, for its approval, ought to muster not
less than 66% votes of the voting share of the financial creditors.”
40. Keeping the aforesaid principles and the relevant statutory provisions in view, we may take up
the points arising for determination in this case.
Point A – Valuation: Regulations 27 and 35
41. The Appellate Tribunal has laid great emphasis on the point that commercial wisdom of CoC was
materially affected for want of existence of a valid and actual valuation report and sharing of all the
M.K. Rajagopalan vs Dr. Periasamy Palani Gounder on 3 May, 2023
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/146393726/
80
relevant facts pertaining to the valuation with the members of CoC leading to violation of
Regulations 27 and 35 of the CIRP Regulations. We are unable to agree. 41.1. It has rightly been
contended on behalf of the appellants that the members of CoC were provided with fair value and
liquidation value after obtaining a confidentiality undertaking. We have reproduced hereinbefore all
the material parts of the minutes of the meetings of CoC and it is at once clear that the members of
CoC were fully satisfied with and endorsed the process of valuation and even re-evaluation as
undertaken by the resolution professional. Particularly, the minutes of second, fourth, sixth and
seventh CoC meetings stand testimony to the fact that the requirements of Regulation were
scrupulously followed and complied with and there had not been any doubt in CoC as regards the
process of valuation as also supplying of fair and liquidation value to the members of CoC. The
detailed findings of the Adjudicating Authority in this regard (reproduced in paragraph 15.1.1.
hereinabove) make it clear that the Adjudicating Authority independently applied its mind to the
process of valuation and presentation of the matter to CoC. Rejection of all the objections in that
regard by the NCLT, called for no interference. 41.2. The Appellate Tribunal appears to have
unnecessarily and rather unjustifiably presumed that there had been blatant statutory violations and
irregularities. Even if certain issues were raised in some of the meetings of CoC as regards the
process of valuation, the clarifications from the resolution professional and the steps taken by him
for valuation and re- valuation had been to the satisfaction of CoC. It has rightly been contended on
behalf of the appellants with reference to the decision in Maharashtra Seamless (supra) that
resolution plan is not required to match the liquidation value as such.
41.3. The findings of the Appellate Tribunal in regard to the question of valuation and thereby taking
the resolution plan to be in contravention of Sections 30(2) and 61(3) of the Code cannot be
approved and are required to be set aside.
Point B – Publication of Form G: Regulation 36-A
42. A long deal of discussion of the Appellate Tribunal had been diverted towards purported
non-compliance of Regulation 36-A(2)(iii) of the CIRP Regulations for want of publication of Form
G on the designated website with the Appellate Tribunal assuming that want of compliance of
mandatory requirements had been of material irregularity on the part of the resolution professional.
The findings of the Appellate Tribunal in this regard are also difficult to be accepted.
42.1. It has rightly been contended on behalf of the resolution professional that Form G was
published in all leading newspapers on 09.08.2020 and then, IBBI was also informed about
technical issues in uploading the Form on the website. The Adjudicating Authority has also rightly
observed that a statutory provision regulating a matter of practice or procedure would generally be
read as directory and in the present case, no prejudice has been shown by anyone as regards
technical non-compliance of all the requirements of publication. It has been too far-stretched on the
part of the Appellate Tribunal to observe that when CIRP was conducted during the periods of
lockdown in the face of Covid-19 pandemic, most of the people avoided reading newspapers under
the apprehension of Covid infection. As noticed, initially as many as 13 EOIs were received. It has
also rightly been contended on behalf of the resolution professional that all the requisite steps
having been reasonably taken, the process that had reached an advanced stage could not have been

Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/146393726/
81
annulled on such technicalities.
42.2. An argument has been advanced on behalf of the appellant- resolution applicant that this issue
relating to publication of Form G was dealt with by NCLAT in the earlier order dated 05.05.2021
and that decision would operate as res judicata. In the relevant part of the said order dated
05.05.2021, the NCLAT even while dealing with the questions raised against time enlargement
granted by NCLT, took note of various features related with the CIRP in question and in that regard,
also observed that it was the commercial decision of CoC not to seek extension of time for
submission of resolution plans and to issue directions to the resolution professional to expedite the
process on the resolution plans already submitted. The NCLAT had observed as under: -
“ 23. On perusal of the minutes of the CoC, it appears that the RP apprised the CoC
about the legal options available either to seek an extension of the timeline for
submission of Resolution Plan or to make the decision for publication of fresh
Form-G. It was the CoC’s commercial decision that “no extension of time for
submission of Resolution Plan should be done and RP was directed to expedite the
valuation process and check the feasibility and viability of the Resolution Plan
already submitted and present the eligible Resolution Plan before the CoC for
consideration.” 42.3. The NCLAT held that the aforesaid was a commercial decision
of CoC not requiring interference of the Court. It has been argued on behalf of the
contesting respondents that, the aforesaid decision cannot be considered res judicata
for they being not the parties to the said appeals decided by NCLAT on 05.05.2021.
In our view, even if principles of res judicata are as such not applied, fact of the
matter remains that at the given stage, the process as undertaken by the resolution
professional had been consistently approved by CoC, Adjudicating Authority and the
Appellate Tribunal. Even otherwise, as observed hereinabove, there had not been any
such illegality or material irregularity for which the entire process would have been
considered vitiated. The findings of the Appellate Tribunal in this regard too, cannot
be approved and are required to be set aside.
Point C1 – Effect of Section 164(2)(b) Companies Act
43. A long length of argument has been advanced by the contesting parties as regards impact of
Section 164(2)(b) of the Companies Act because of the alleged default of the company named
International Aviation Academy Private Limited of which, the resolution applicant is a director. It
has been argued that the said company collected share application money pending allotment and
did not refund the same; and consequently, in terms of Section 164(2)(b) of the Companies Act, this
default would disqualify the resolution applicant from acting as a director and thereby, would
render him ineligible to submit a resolution plan. We find it difficult to accept the submissions
aforesaid and the propositions against the resolution applicant on this score.
43.1. Even if there had been any possibility of the resolution applicant incurring such a
disqualification in terms of Section 164(2)(b) of the Companies Act, because of alleged default of
another company, in which he is a director, to refund the share application money, the same would

Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/146393726/
82
essentially be a matter of consideration of the registrar of companies. Unless a categorical finding
was recorded in the competent forum as regards any such default and unless specific order
disqualifying the resolution applicant as director because of such default came into existence, it
could not have been taken by way of any process of assumption that the appellant-resolution
applicant was disqualified to act as a director and thereby, was ineligible to submit a resolution plan.
It has rightly been pointed out that when DIN status of the appellant was “active compliant”, he
could not have been treated as ineligible. 43.2. Again, it has been too far-stretched on the part of the
Appellate Tribunal to refer to the Rule 2(1)(c) of the Companies (Acceptance of Deposits) Rules,
2014 and then to make a declaration as if the resolution applicant was disqualified in terms of
Section 164(2)(b) of the Companies Act. Although, we do not agree with the submissions on behalf
of appellant that such an issue of eligibility could not have been raised before NCLAT for the first
time because the question of eligibility of the resolution applicant goes to the root of the matter but,
we do agree with the other part of the submission in this regard that there is no concept of deemed
disqualification under Section 164(2)(b) of the Companies Act. 43.3. Hence, in our view, the
Appellate Tribunal had not been right in holding the resolution applicant ineligible by virtue of
Section 164(2)(b) of the Companies Act. Point C1 is answered accordingly. Point C2 – Effect of
Section 88 Trusts Act
44. What has been stated hereinabove in relation to the question of ineligibility of the resolution
applicant in terms of Section 164(2)(b) of the Companies Act, however, does not apply in relation to
the other material objection as regards Section 88 of the Trusts Act.
44.1. It is not in dispute that the trust “Sri Balaji Vidyapeeth” of which the appellant-resolution
applicant is the Managing Trustee, was one of the disqualified resolution applicants on the ground
that the said entity was a charitable trust. It has been argued on behalf of the appellant that his
status as Managing Trustee of the said trust does not render him ineligible while submitting the
resolution plan in his individual capacity. It has also been argued that even if the trust may be
disqualified, the appellant cannot be disqualified because his financial capability was independent of
the trust money. In our view, this part of the matter cannot be examined by a broad and generalised
reference to the separate status of the two entities, i.e., the trust on one hand and the resolution
applicant as an individual on the other.
44.2. Noticeable it is that the said trust was held ineligible on the ground that it was a charitable
trust and cannot run a profit-making entity. The EOIs in the first place were submitted by the
present appellant-resolution applicant for himself as also on behalf of the trust. The Appellate
Tribunal has rightly noticed that this filing of two EOIs by the resolution applicant, one for himself
and another one on behalf of the ineligible trust has a material bearing on the competence of the
resolution plan of the appellant, for being directly hit by Section 88 of the Trusts Act. The Appellate
Tribunal has rightly held that the applicant-Mr. M.K. Rajagopalan, being the Managing Trustee of
the said trust, cannot be permitted to act as its alter ego in implementing the resolution plan to gain
financial advantage for himself. By virtue of the operation and impact of Section 88 of the Trusts
Act, submission of individual resolution plan by the appellant cannot be countenanced for any
implementation of the said individual resolution plan would nevertheless be hit by the provisions
contained in the Trusts Act. We may elaborate a little.

83
44.3. The suggestion on the part of the resolution applicant to assert his independent standing
detached from the said ineligible applicant Sri Balaji Vidyapeeth carries its own shortcoming when
examined in the context of the assertions made by him in clauses 3.5 and 3.10 of his resolution plan
which have been extracted by the Appellate Tribunal and we are impelled to re-extract them for
ready reference as under: -
“3.5. Sri Balaji Vidyapeeth: Mr. M.K. Rajagopalan is the founder and managing
trustee of Sri Balaji Vidyapeeth……… 3.10. Financial Snapshot “The entities under the
leadership of Mr. M.K. Rajagopalan have been growing rapidly while ensuring quality
of service to nation and public at large……..
There entities have achieved turnover of Rs. 417.94 Crores in FY 2016- 2017; Rs.
500.03 Crores in FY 2017-2018; Rs. 679.23 Crores in FY 2018-2019 and Rs.860.59
Crores (estimated) for FY 2019-
2020. The above growth is ample testimony of the credentials of the RA as a competent business
leader and his capability to manage and turn around various diverse businesses.” 44.3.1. It is thus
obvious that the appellant-resolution applicant admitted his status as founder and managing trustee
of said Sri Balaji Vidyapeeth and then, boldly claimed that the entities under his leadership were
growing rapidly while ensuring quality of service to nation and public at large. In view of the claim
made by the resolution applicant himself, coupled with the fact that in CIRP in question, two
resolution plans were submitted by this appellant, one in individual capacity and another as
managing director of the said trust, it is difficult to detach him from the said resolution applicant-Sri
Balaji Vidyapeeth. Hence, it cannot be said that the Appellate Tribunal committed any error in
observing that the appellant was attempting to act as alter ego of the said ineligible applicant (the
trust); and the benefit from his own (individual’s) resolution plan cannot escape the operation of
Section 88 of the Trusts Act. Even if the appellant would assert that his financial capability was
independent of trust money, the fact of the matter remains that he projected the overall picture of
his own profile while also relying on his status as Managing Trustee of the said trust, Sri Balaji
Vidyapeeth. Thus, any pecuniary advantage gained by him under the resolution plan in question
would be directly subsumed by operation of Section 88 of the Trusts Act. This would, in all practical
purposes, bring about a position that what could not be done directly for the said trust was sought to
be done by the appellant by way of this indirect methodology.
44.4. Although, the aspects aforesaid did not form the part of consideration of CoC but, they cannot
be ignored merely with reference to the status assigned to the commercial wisdom of CoC. The
principles underlying the decisions of this Court respecting the commercial wisdom of CoC cannot
be over-expanded to brush aside a significant shortcoming in the decision making of CoC when it
had not duly taken note of the operation of any provision of law for the time being in force.
44.5. In the given set of facts and circumstances of this case, in our view, the Appellate Tribunal has
rightly held the resolution plan being in contravention of the provisions of law for the time being in
force. Observations and findings of the Appellate Tribunal in paragraphs 106 to 112 of the impugned
order dated 17.02.2022 (reproduced hereinabove in paragraph 19.4.2.) deserve to be and are
M.K. Rajagopalan vs Dr. Periasamy Palani Gounder on 3 May, 2023

84
approved. Point C3 – Effect of Section 166(4) Companies Act
45. For what has been discussed hereinabove, the submission of resolution plan by the
appellant-resolution applicant was directly hit by Section 88 of the Trusts Act and could not have
been approved. In this view of the matter, no other aspect appears requiring consideration as
regards the question of eligibility of the resolution applicant. However, we have formulated point C3
for determination in view of the submissions made in this case as regards another feature of
ineligibility of the resolution applicant and it appears appropriate to deal with this aspect of the
matter too.
45.1. The status of the appellant-resolution applicant as Managing Director of another company
MGM Healthcare Private Limited is not of any dispute. Rather, the particulars of this company and
projections for taking this company forward had been stated extensively by the resolution applicant
in his profile submitted with the resolution plan. As per the resolution plan, the appellant-resolution
applicant had proposed to convert the Coimbatore property of the corporate debtor into a hospital.
The said MGM Healthcare Private Limited is also said to be a super-speciality hospital and the
company is said to be looking forward to set-up new hospitals and aspires to be a leading hospital
chain in India. 45.2. In the backdrop of the aforesaid facts, noticeable it is that Section 166(4) of the
Companies Act prohibits a director of a company from involving himself in a situation in which he
may have a direct or even indirect interest that conflicts, or may possibly conflict, with the interest
of the company. Given the status of the resolution applicant as Managing Director of MGM
Healthcare Private Limited, his dealing with property of the corporate debtor and converting the
same into a hospital cannot be said to be having no impact on the activities of the said MGM
Healthcare Private Limited. A direct conflict of interest being writ large on the face of the record, it
cannot be said that the prohibition in terms of Section 166(4) does not operate and the resolution
plan does not stand in contravention of any of the provisions of law for the time being in force. For
this reason too, in our view, the appellant-resolution applicant could not have been accepted as
eligible applicant.
Point D1 – Revision of resolution plan after approval by CoC
46. Even when the findings of the Appellate Tribunal as regards valuation process and
non-compliance of other procedural requirements have not been approved by us, a material factor
which otherwise may appear to be of another procedural requirement, has its significant bearing
and cannot be ignored as mere technicality. It is concerning want of presentation of finally revised
plan to the committee of creditors before being presented to the Adjudicating Authority.
47. As noticed hereinbefore, commercial wisdom of CoC is given such a status of primacy that the
same is considered rather a matter non- justiciable in any adjudicatory process, be it by the
Adjudicating Authority or even by this Court. However, the commercial wisdom of CoC means a
considered decision taken by CoC with reference to the commercial interests and the interest of
revival of the corporate debtor and maximization of value of its assets. This wisdom is not a matter
of rhetoric but is denoting a well-considered decision by the protagonist of CIRP i.e., CoC. As
observed by this Court in K. Sashidhar (supra), the financial creditors forming CoC ‘act on the basis
M.K. Rajagopalan vs Dr. Periasamy Palani Gounder on 3 May, 2023
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/146393726/
85
of thorough examination of the proposed resolution plan and assessment made by their team of
experts. The opinion on the subject-matter expressed by them after due deliberations in CoC
meetings through voting, as per voting shares, is a collective business decision.’ This Court also
observed in K. Sashidhar that ‘there is an intrinsic assumption that financial creditors are fully
informed about the viability of the corporate debtor and feasibility of the proposed resolution plan.’
These observations read with the observations in Essar Steel (supra) with reference to the reasons
stated in the report of Bankruptcy Law Reforms Committee of November 2015, make it clear that
commercial wisdom of CoC is assigned primacy in CIRP for it represents collective business
decision, which is arrived at after thorough examination of the proposed resolution plan and
assessment made with involvement of experts by the body of persons who are most vitally interested
in rapid and efficient decision making. It follows as a necessary corollary that to be worth its name,
the commercial wisdom of CoC would come into existence and operation only when all the relevant
information is available before it and is duly deliberated upon by all its members, who have direct
and substantial interest in the survival of corporate debtor and in the entire CIRP.
47.1. In light of the aforesaid position of law and its operation in relation to the decision-making
process of CoC, it needs hardly any emphasis that each and every aspect relating to the resolution
plan, and more particularly its financial layout, has to be before the CoC before it could be said to
have arrived at a considered decision in its commercial wisdom.
48. From the facts and the proceedings pertaining to the present case, as noticed in detail
hereinbefore, it is but clear that in the ninth CoC meeting held on 22.01.2021, the resolution plan
submitted by the appellant- resolution applicant was approved with 87.39% of the total voting share
of the financial creditors present and voting. However, this approval came with a significant
condition that in view of the dissent by some of the financial creditors, the plan would be sent back
to the creditors for further revision so as to make it complaint with Section 30(2) of the Code which
provides that the amount paid to the dissenting financial creditors will not be less than the amount
paid to such creditors in accordance with Section 53 of the Code in the event of the liquidation of the
corporate debtor. On 25.01.2021, the appellant-resolution applicant submitted the revised
resolution plan incorporating the changes. He also submitted bank guarantee as noticed
hereinbefore. However, the resolution professional did not place the revised plan in CoC meeting
but directly presented it to the Adjudicating Authority for approval. This process has not been
approved by the Appellate Tribunal, while observing that based on the resolution in the ninth
meeting of CoC, the resolution plan was sent back for further revision and the revised plan was
never presented to CoC for approval. Two major submissions in this regard by the
appellant-resolution applicant are: first, that the plan had already been approved by the CoC and it
was only the requirement of allocating eligible amount to the dissenting financial creditors and
hence, there was no need to seek further approval of the CoC; and secondly, that in the tenth
meeting, the CoC had granted the deemed post facto approval to the revised plan and not objected to
any of its portions even in the later affidavits. The resolution professional would also contend that
the resolution applicant was only required to provide for redistribution to ensure that dissenting
financial creditors were given their share. It has also been submitted that in the modified resolution
plan the allocation for the unsecured dissenting financial creditors was revised from Rs. 29 crore to
Rs. 49.13 crore. 48.1. On the submissions as made, at the first blush it might appear as if revision of
M.K. Rajagopalan vs Dr. Periasamy Palani Gounder on 3 May, 2023
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/146393726/
86
the plan after ninth CoC meeting had been a matter of formality and consequential to the approval
already given by the CoC. However, on a close look at the scheme of IBC, this irregularity of not
placing the revised plan after ninth meeting before the CoC and directly placing it before
Adjudicating Authority cannot be ignored as a mere technicality. As noticed hereinabove, each and
every aspect relating to the resolution plan, and more particularly its financial layout, has to be
considered by the CoC before it could be said to have arrived at a considered decision. The fact that
there had been a change in financial layout in the resolution plan in question is not a matter of
dispute. When CoC applied itself and arrived at a decision in its commercial wisdom with approval
by the requisite majority, it was equally the requirement that the resolution applicant would revise
the plan. In terms of the minutes of the ninth CoC meeting, it is difficult to assume that the CoC had
even in anticipation given an approval to the plan which was to be revised. As to what decision CoC
would have taken after examination of the revised plan, pursuant to its decision in the ninth
meeting, cannot be a matter of guess or assumption that it was bound to be approved. As to which
aspect would have arisen for consideration of CoC after revision of the plan is again a matter of
uncertainty but it cannot be said that the conditional approval in the ninth CoC meeting was to be
treated as fait accompli. This, in our view, is not the true operation of the scheme of the process of
corporate insolvency resolution nor could the commercial wisdom of CoC be a matter of
assumption. Looking to the nature and form of decision taken by the CoC in its ninth meeting, such
a conditional approval could not have been treated as a final approval. Whereafter, whatever be the
revision, the plan was only to be presented to CoC and could have been presented to the
Adjudicating Authority only after final approval of CoC by the requisite majority. In other words,
when the modified resolution plan, even if carrying minor modification/revision was not finally
approved by CoC, its presentation to the Adjudicating Authority amounts to a material irregularity
and this defect cannot be cured. 48.2. The suggestion of post facto approval of the revised resolution
plan in the tenth CoC meeting has only been noted to be rejected. There is no and there cannot be
any concept of post facto approval of any resolution plan by CoC which had not been placed before it
prior to the filing before the Adjudicating Authority. Moreover, in the tenth CoC meeting dated
15.06.2021, Agenda Item No. A1 only related to the updates of resolution professional where he, of
course, stated about the plan having been revised and filed with NCLT on 04.02.2021. Such updates
by resolution professional, even if taken note of by CoC, could hardly be considered as of approval
by requisite majority of voting share in the CoC. In any case, prior to this meeting, the plan had
already been presented to the Adjudicating Authority. That plan could not have been approved
thereafter by the CoC.
49. We would hasten to observe that the requirement of CIRP Regulations, particularly of placing
the resolution plan in its final form before the CoC, has to be scrupulously complied with. No
alteration or modification in the process could be countenanced. We say so for the specific reason
concerning law that if the process as adopted in the present matter is approved, the very scheme of
the Code and CIRP regulations would be left open-ended and would be capable of inviting
arbitrariness at any level. The minor procedural aspects which we have held to be not of material
bearing hereinbefore and this aspect pertaining to approval of financial resolution plan by CoC
stand at entirely different footing. The irregularity in the process of approval by CoC and filing
before Adjudicating Authority are not the matters of such formal nature that deviation in that regard
could be ignored or condoned. As stated above, when commercial wisdom of CoC is assigned
M.K. Rajagopalan vs Dr. Periasamy Palani Gounder on 3 May, 2023
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/146393726/
87
primacy, it presupposes a considered decision on the resolution plan in its final form.
50. For what has been discussed hereinabove, disapproval of the resolution plan by the Appellate
Tribunal for want of presentation of final resolution plan before CoC remains unexceptionable and
calls for no interference.
Point D2 – Increase of fees of resolution professional
51. Though we have approved the findings of the Appellate Tribunal that the resolution plan in
question, which was placed before Adjudicating Authority for approval without having been put to
vote before CoC was void and non-est but, an ancillary observation of the Appellate Tribunal in
correlating this material irregularity with increase of fees of resolution professional is difficult to be
accepted.
51.1. The CoC had precisely deliberated over the question of increase of fees of resolution
professional and its decision in that regard could not have been correlated with any shortcoming in
the process undertaken, which might have occurred for want of an erroneous assumption on the
part of the resolution professional in view of the contents of minutes of ninth CoC meeting dated
22.01.2021. Though as aforesaid, when the resolution plan was to be revised so as to make provision
for dissenting financial creditors, the financial outlay was going to be altered and it ought to have
been placed before CoC again but, it is too far-stretched to connect this irregularity with the increase
of fees of the resolution professional. The findings and observations of the Appellate Tribunal
against resolution professional in this regard deserve to be set aside. Point E – The matter
concerning related party
52. Another factor taken into consideration by the Appellate Tribunal has been in relation to the
so-called discrimination in the resolution plan in relation to a related party of the corporate debtor.
53. Learned counsel for the appellant in Civil Appeal No.1827 of 2022 has referred to several
decided cases to submit that therein, even when certain dues of related parties were admitted, the
resolution plans not providing for any payment to such related parties were upheld by this Court;
and that the principles of non-discrimination would not be applicable to the decision of CoC. It has
been argued on behalf of the resolution professional that none of the statutory requirements are of
any mandate that a provision has to be made in the resolution plan for payment to the related
parties. According to the learned counsel, the need is, essentially, to ensure that the plan provides
for payment to financial creditors (including dissenting financial creditors) entitled to vote. Thus,
the plan in question cannot be said to be standing in contravention of any mandatory requirements.
Per contra, the learned counsel appearing for the related party would submit that even when related
party is to be treated as a separate class in terms of the principles laid down by this Court in Phoenix
ARC (supra), so as to be excluded from CoC, there is no reason that they be treated as separate class
when it comes to payment of dues under the resolution plan. It is submitted that failure to provide
for discharge of debt of the related party is in violation of Section 30(2)(b), (e) and (f) of the Code.
The submissions made on behalf of the related party and the observations of the Appellate Tribunal
are difficult to be accepted.
M.K. Rajagopalan vs Dr. Periasamy Palani Gounder on 3 May, 2023

88
54. The lengthy discussion of Appellate Tribunal in regard to the related party (the parts whereof
have been reproduced in paragraph 19.7 hereinabove) depict rather unsure and irreconcilable
observations of the Appellate Tribunal.
54.1. After taking note of the fact that related party is prohibited to be a part of CoC and is further
prohibited to be a resolution applicant or an authorized representative etc., the Appellate Tribunal
has rightly observed that involvement of a related party in CIRP in any capacity was seen as giving
unfair benefit to the corporate debtor; and that the statutory recognition of related party as a
different class would apply even to resolution plan when CoC would decide whether in its
commercial wisdom it should pay to related party at all because that would mean paying to the same
persons who are behind the corporate debtor. However, thereafter the Appellate Tribunal proceeded
to observe that related party was required to be equated with the promoters as equity share-holders
and then, further made certain observations about discrimination between related party unsecured
financial creditor and other unsecured financial creditors as also between related party operational
creditor and other operational creditors. Such far-stretched observations of the Appellate Tribunal
are difficult to be reconciled with the operation of the statutory provisions.
54.2. It has rightly been argued on behalf of the appellants and had rightly been observed by the
Adjudicating Authority (vide extraction in paragraph 15.4.1 hereinabove) that there was no
provision in the Code which mandates that the related party should be paid in parity with the
unrelated party. So long as the provisions of Code and CIRP Regulations are met, any proposition of
differential payment to different class of creditors in the resolution plan is, ultimately, subject to the
commercial wisdom of CoC and no fault can be attached to the resolution plan merely for not
making the provisions for related party.
54.3. On the facts of the present case, we find no reason to discuss this matter any further when it is
noticed that the promoter and erstwhile director, the contesting respondent before us, has been
holding the position of Chairman of the said related party. Suffice it would be to observe for the
present purpose that the Appellate Tribunal has erred in applying the principles of
non-discrimination and thereby holding against the resolution plan in question for want of
provision for related party. Point F – NCLAT’s findings regarding settlement offer of promoter
55. The discussion foregoing, particularly with answers to points C2, C3 and D1 is decisive of the
matter so far as approval of the resolution plan in question is concerned. As noticed, for want of
eligibility of the resolution applicant and for want for approval of the finally revised resolution plan
by CoC meeting, the resolution plan in question is required to be rejected and the process as
adopted in seeking approval of the Adjudicating Authority is required to be disapproved. However,
the other segment of consideration in this case, carrying the peculiarities of its own, relates to the
settlement offer of the promoter and operation of the provisions of Section 12-A of the Code.
56. A comprehensive look at the factual aspects and the orders previously passed in the matter make
it clear that right from the inception of CIRP in question, the promoter and erstwhile director had
made several attempts to invoke the operation of Section 12-A of the Code. At the very initial stage,
while admitted the petition made by TFCI, the NCLT observed in its order dated 05.05.2020 that
M.K. Rajagopalan vs Dr. Periasamy Palani Gounder on 3 May, 2023
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/146393726/
89
the attempts on the part of corporate debtor by way OTS settlement proposal had only been to gain
time. Yet again, when the process has gone several steps ahead and when the resolution plans were
being put to vote, just a day before voting, the promoter put forth yet another settlement proposal
without any concrete plan and without disclosing the source of funds to complete the settlement.
The CoC, after due deliberation, refused to consider the same and thereafter voted on the resolution
plan in question.
57. The Adjudicating Authority (NCLT) dealt with the matter in sufficient detail (vide paragraph 15.2
and relevant extraction therein) while noting that even the original applicant of CIRP, i.e., TFIC, was
kept in dark about such a proposal. It was also noticed that even the term-sheet to support the
proposal from Deutsche Bank came with a disclaimer. In the totality of facts and circumstances, the
proposals as made by the promoter and erstwhile director were all of eyewash and of dilatory tactics.
However, the Appellate Tribunal (NCLAT) proceeded to observe that in the ninth CoC meeting, no
discussion about settlement proposal had occurred and that CoC never considered the settlement
proposal submitted by the promoter and erstwhile director; and that after getting the settlement
proposal, it was incumbent upon the resolution professional to call the CoC meeting for
consideration of such proposal. The observations of the Appellate Tribunal cannot be said to be in
conformity with the record of proceedings. 57.1. As noticed, the proposal in question was forwarded
for consideration only at the eleventh hour, i.e., a day before CoC was to vote on the resolution plan
in its ninth meeting. The CoC, in the said meeting, indeed, took into consideration the proposition of
settlement and application for withdrawal request letter, which was circulated two hours before the
meeting. The creditors with significant voting shares such as SBI and Bank of India were clear in
their stand that they would stick to the agenda and would not deviate therefrom. The resolution
professional had to request the representatives of the corporate debtor to allow the agenda items to
go through as per the wishes of the majority of CoC and no further discussions were to be made on
the letter sent to CoC. When the substantial majority of CoC was not in favour of such discussion
which was proposed to be thrusted on them only a few hours before the meeting, their approach
cannot be faulted at. In any case, an application for withdrawal in terms of Section 12-A of the Code
could have been made only if CoC approved the proposal with 90% voting share. When the creditors
with substantial voting share were against any such proposal, any consideration was clearly ruled
out and there could not have been any valid application for withdrawal.
58. Thus, the Appellate Tribunal has erred in holding that the settlement offer of the promoter in
terms of Section 12-A was not placed for consideration of CoC. Approval of resolution plan in
question could not have been reversed on this count. However, as noticed hereinbefore, approval of
the resolution plan in question could not have been endorsed by the Appellate Tribunal because of
other substantial reasons. Point G – Impact and effect of subsequent events
59. The discussion aforesaid would have been decisive of the matter but there had been several
subsequent events in this matter, particularly of fresh invitation for EOI and then, approval of the
settlement offer of the promoter by the CoC in its nineteenth meeting held on 12.10.2022 by 100%
majority of the voting share. Thus, the question is about the impact and effect of such subsequent
events. For dealing with this question, we need to recapitulate the relevant background aspects of
the case and the chronology of subsequent events.

60. As noticed, in the impugned judgment and order dated 17.02.2022, the Appellate Tribunal had
directed the CoC to reconsider the offer of the promoter within fifteen days from the date of its order
(i.e., within fifteen days from 17.02.2022). Prior to this, twice over the propositions of such
settlement offer by the promoter had been dealt with disfavourably. The relevant parts of
proceedings in the ninth CoC meeting concerning such proposal have already been noticed
hereinbefore. It is noticed that after approval of the resolution plan, the promoter again submitted a
settlement proposal on 08.03.2021 which was followed by a letter dated 14.07.2021 from one
Saveetha Institute of Medical and Technical Sciences as proof of funding, but the said letter was
subsequently withdrawn by the said Institute. The resolution plan was approved by the Adjudicating
Authority on 15.07.2021, which was challenged by the promoter and the Appellate Tribunal granted
stay over operation of the order dated 15.07.2021. The Appellate Tribunal, ultimately, allowed the
appeal and apart from disapproving the resolution plan in question, directed the resolution
professional to call for the meeting of CoC within 15 days from the date of judgment and to proceed
with CIRP from the stage of publication of Form G and put the proposal of promoter before CoC for
consideration. In compliance of these directions of NCLAT, eleventh CoC meeting was held on
03.03.2022 where the settlement proposal of the promoter was put to vote in the CoC; the voting
continued until 25.03.2022; and ultimately, the said settlement proposal was voted against by
51.81% of the voting share.
61. After such rejection of the settlement proposal of the promoter, as we have detailed hereinabove
in paragraphs 26.1 to 26.4, proceedings continued in CoC for invitation of fresh EOI and for that
purpose, CoC even resolved to seek further time extension to the Adjudicating Authority. 61.1. On
29.09.2022, in the eighteenth CoC meeting, it was informed that seven resolution plans had been
received and their evaluation was under process but, the CoC members were informed that another
settlement proposal was received from the promoter on 19.09.2022. At that stage, again, when the
mandatory 330 days’ period was about to end, the CoC members unanimously voted to seek
extension of CIRP timelines. Then, on 12.10.2022, the discussion on the settlement proposal of the
promoter took place, it was put to vote and was approved by the CoC with 100% of the total voting
powers.
62. The aforesaid proceedings continued with the matter remaining pending in this Court. The
question is, what ought to be the way forward? At the first blush, it may appear that when the
settlement proposal has now been approved by the CoC with 100% voting powers in their
commercial wisdom, the process thereunder may be allowed to continue as such. However, a
blanket approval by this Court at this stage is fraught with other complications.
63. Section 12-A was introduced in the Code later and in accordance with the Insolvency Law
Report, March, 2018. This provision was introduced to provide for a mechanism for withdrawal
upon settlement which was missing in IBC as originally promulgated. Regulation 30-A was also
introduced to the CIRP Regulations. It was further amended with effect from 25.07.2019, providing
for withdrawal of CIRP even after issuance of expression of interest but, with the condition that the
applicant shall state the reasons justifying withdrawal after issuance of EOI.

64. As noticed from various events, even at the threshold stage, the NCLT noticed the settlement
proposal on behalf of the corporate debtor but then, found the same to be an eyewash which was put
forward only to gain time. The petition was admitted, triggering CIRP. Significantly, the settlement
proposal then came up from the promoter only a day before the received resolution plans were to be
put to vote, i.e., on 21.01.2021. The CoC, even when not formerly voting on it, clearly rejected the
same for the Agenda having already set for dealing with the resolution plan received from the
resolution applicant. As noticed, after approval of the resolution plan, the promoter again submitted
a settlement proposal but the Institute, said to be supporting the same, subsequently withdrew.
After allowing of the appeal by NCLAT and in terms of those directions, the new settlement proposal
was precisely put to vote and was rejected. Thereafter, fresh EOIs were invited and resolution plans
were received. Significantly, the promoter moved another settlement proposal for invoking Section
12-A of the Code on 19.09.2022, only after receiving of the resolution plans from seven prospective
resolution applicants. A pattern in the aforesaid dealings by the promoter is quite striking. When the
resolutions plans had been received at the earlier stage, only at the eleventh hour, the settlement
proposal came up. This time too, the settlement proposal came up from the promoter only after
resolution plans had been received. Prior to it, his proposal had already been rejected. It gets
perforce commented that the representative of the corporate debtor being a part of CoC, such
proposer is obviously in a position to know about the propositions in the resolution plans when
received in response to invitation.
65. We have pondered over various facets of this rather ticklish part of the matter because on one
hand stands the approval of the re-submitted settlement proposal by 100% voting powers in the CoC
and on the other hand, fact of the matter remains that before such settlement proposal, second time
EOIs had been invited and in fact, seven resolution plans had been received. As noticed, the earlier
settlement proposal from the promoter came up only a day before the resolution plans were to be
put to vote, i.e., on 21.01.2021. This time again, the settlement proposals came up from the promoter
only on 19.09.2022 after receiving of seven resolution plans from the prospective resolution
applicants.
66. We are not expanding further on the matter because when we find that the settlement proposal
of the promoter, after approval of CoC, for invoking the provisions of Section 12-A of the Code, is
pending before the Adjudicating Authority, in our view, it shall be in the fitness of things that all the
relevant aspects of the matter are left open for consideration of the Adjudicating Authority,
including those relating to the justification for invoking Section 12-A after issuance of fresh
invitation for EOI and after receiving resolution plans. In other words, we would leave all the
relevant aspects open for consideration of the Adjudicating Authority in accordance with law while
keeping in view the observations of this Court. Summation
67. For what has been discussed hereinabove, disapproval of the resolution plan in question by the
Appellate Tribunal (NCLAT) in the impugned order dated 17.02.2022 is not to be interfered with
but, not for all the reasons which weighed with the Appellate Tribunal. As observed hereinabove, the
reasons and findings of the Appellate Tribunal in relation to the valuation process and alleged
non-compliance of some of the procedural provisions as also the observations against increase of
fees of resolution professional (points A, B and D2) are not to be approved. Similarly, the Appellate

Tribunal has not been right in holding the resolution applicant ineligible to submit a resolution plan
with reference to Section 164(2)(b) of the Companies Act, 2013 (as held in point C1). The
disapproval by the Appellate Tribunal, with reference to the settlement offer of promoter in terms of
Section 12-A of the Code, and its purported non- consideration is also not approved by us and such
findings of the Appellate Tribunal are required to be set aside (as held in point F). Similarly, the
Appellate Tribunal has erred in applying the principles of non-discrimination in relation to the
related party (as held in point E). However, the other findings in relation to points C2, C3 and D1
and the consequential order passed by the Appellate Tribunal deserve to be approved. 67.1.
Therefore, the impugned judgment and order dated 17.02.2022 in relation to the issues covered by
points for determination A, B, C1, D2, E and F is not approved and findings of the Appellate
Tribunal in that regard are set aside. However, rejection of the resolution plan is maintained in view
of the answers to points C2, C3 and D1.
68. Putting it in different words, we are clearly of the view that even while respecting the
commercial wisdom of CoC, in the present case, the resolution plan in question could not have been
approved by the Adjudicating Authority for two major reasons: one, for the ineligibility of the
resolution applicant; and second, for not placing of the revised resolution plan in the CoC before
seeking approval from the Adjudicating Authority. Of course, on the questions relating to the
valuation reports, and want of publication of Form G on the website, we are at one with the
Adjudicating Authority that these aspects were not of material bearing in the process in question
and the resolution professional had taken reasonable steps as permissible in law and feasible in the
circumstances. Similarly, we are not inclined to endorse the views of the Appellate Tribunal
regarding the treatment of related party in the resolution plan as also regarding the settlement offer
of the promotor; and the process in that relation cannot be said to be suffering from any illegality.
69. So far the subsequent events concerning invitation of fresh EOIs and approval of the fresh
settlement proposal of the promoter by the CoC are concerned, all the relevant aspects are kept open
for consideration of the Adjudicating Authority.
Conclusion
70. In view of the above, these appeals are disposed of in the following terms: -
1. The impugned judgment and order dated 17.02.2022 is not interfered with only insofar the
Appellate Tribunal has not approved the resolution plan in question for the reasons which have been
affirmed by us in points C2, C3 and D1 hereinbefore. Other findings, observations and directions of
the Appellate Tribunal are set aside.
2. The question of dealing with fresh settlement proposal of the promoter, as approved by the CoC in
its nineteenth meeting dated 12.10.2022 after receiving fresh resolution plans, is left open for
consideration of the Adjudicating Authority, who shall be expected to deal with this aspect of the
matter while keeping in view the law applicable and the facts of the present case as also the
observations foregoing.
