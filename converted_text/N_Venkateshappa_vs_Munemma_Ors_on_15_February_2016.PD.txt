1. Leave granted.
2. These appeals arise out of Judgment and Order dated 27.07.2010 in Regular Second Appeal
No.323 of 2008 and order dated 1.06.2011 passed in R.P. No.476 of 2010 by the High Court of
Karnataka at Bangalore.
3. The Karnataka Village Offices Act, 1961 abolishes village offices which were held hereditarily
before the commencement of the Constitution of India. The appointed date under Section 2(a) of the
Act is 01.02.1963. Section 4 of the Act abolishes all village offices on and with effect from the
appointed date and sub-section (3) of Section 4 stipulates that subject to the provisions of Sections
5, 6 and 7 land annexed to a village office shall stand resumed and be subject to the payment of land
revenue as if it were unalienated land or ryotwari land. Section 5 of the Act lays down that the lands
so resumed under Section 4(3) of the Act and not falling under Sections 6 and 7 of the Act be
granted to the person who were holders of the village offices immediately prior to the appointed date
on such payment as prescribed. Sections 6 and 7 of the Act lay down that if the land so resumed is
held by an authorized holder it shall be re-granted to such holder on payment of occupancy price as
prescribed.

4. The Act was amended by Act No.13 of 1978 which inter alia inserted Section 5(4) as under:-
“5(4) Any transfer of land in contravention of sub-section (3) shall be null and void and the land so
transferred shall, as penalty, be forfeited to and vest in the State Government free from all
encumbrances and any person in possession thereof shall be summarily evicted therefrom by the
Deputy Commissioner and the land shall be disposed of in accordance with the law applicable to the
disposal of unoccupied unalienated lands: Provided that if the person who has transferred the land
in contravention of sub-section (3) is not alive, while disposing of such land, preference shall be
given to the heirs of such person.
Explanation.—For removal of doubts it is hereby declared that in sub- section (3), and in this
sub-section transfer includes creation of a lease. ” Section 7 of the Act as substituted by the
Amendment Act now reads as under:
“7. Eviction of unauthorised holders etc.— (1) Where any land resumed under clause (3) of Section 4
is in the possession of an unauthorised holder such unauthorised holder shall be summarily evicted
therefrom and the land shall be taken possession of by the Deputy Commissioner in accordance with
law: Provided that no such summary eviction shall be made except after giving the person affected a
reasonable opportunity of making representation.
(2) Any order of eviction passed under sub-section (1) shall be final and shall not be questioned in
any court of law and no injunction shall be granted by any court in respect of any proceeding taken
or about to be taken by the Deputy Commissioner in pursuance of the power conferred by sub-
section (1).
(3) The land from which an unauthorised holder is evicted under sub- section (1) shall,-
(a) if it was granted or continued in respect of or annexed to an inferior village office be re-granted
to the holder of such village office; and
(b) in other cases be disposed of in accordance with the law applicable to the disposal of unoccupied
unalienated lands.”
5. In Lakshmana Gowda v. State of Karnataka[1], Division Bench of the High Court had an occasion
to consider questions including one concerning rights of an alienee of a service inam land from its
holder or the authorized holder. It dealt with various issues but the one concerning the present
matter was Question No. (iii) which was to the following effect:
“(iii) Did an alienee of a service inam land from its holder or the authorized holder, acquire title to
such land, if the alienation had taken place between the date of the coming into force of the
Principal Act and the date of the re-grant, after its re-grant to its holder or the authorized holder
under Section 5 or 6, as the case may be, of the Principal Act ? ”

6. The answer to the aforesaid question was given in para 66 of the Judgment in the following
words-:
“Hence, our answer to the question is that if the holder or the authorized holder of a Service Inam
land had alienated it after the Principal Act came into force and before it was re-granted to him
under Section 5 or 6 of the Principal Act, the alienee acquired a title to that land after such re- grant
to his alienor.”
7. During the course of its discussion concerning the aforesaid question, it was also observed:-
“We have already held that though the holder or the authorized holder of a Service Inam Land got
title to such land only when it was actually re- granted to him under S. 5 or 6 of the Principal Act,
such title related back to the date of coming into force of that Act. From this, it would follow that if
he purported to alienate such land before it was re-granted to him, but after the Principal Act came
into force, the doctrine of feeding the grant by estoppels embodied in  S. 43 of the Transfer of
Property Act, would apply and the title he subsequently acquired on such re- grant of that land,
would ensure to the benefit of his alienee, who would get a good title to such land after such re-grant
to his alienor.”
8. The aforesaid view in Lakshmana Gowda 1 was affirmed by Full Bench of the High Court in Syed
Bhasheer Ahamed v. State of Karnataka[2] . While considering the rights of an alienee under an
alienation made between 01.02.1963 and 07.08-1978 i.e. between the period of the appointed date
and the date when the Amendment Act came into force, the Full Bench in para 30
(f) of its judgment observed as under:-
“There is no provision in the Act authorizing the State Government or its authorities to evict an
alienee under an alienation made between 1-2-1963 and 7-8-1978. Section 7 is not applicable, as
such an alienee is not an ‘unauthorised holder’. If the land alienated between 1-2-1963 and 7-8-
1978, is subsequently re-granted to the alienor, the benefit of such re- grant, namely, title will enure
to the benefit of the alienee. If the land is not re-granted to the alienor, but to someone else on the
ground that the alienor is not a ‘holder’ or ‘authorised holder’, then the alienee will be in the position
of a transferee from a person without any title; and the grantee to whom the re-grant is made, will
be entitled to obtain possession from the alienee and the limitation for such grantee to dispossesses
the alienee will commence from the date of re-grant.”
9. Agricultural land bearing Survey No.83 of Hoshalli Village, Kolar District, Karnataka
admeasuring 3 acres 39 guntas was Thalavari Inamthi land in the hands of original Baruvardars
named Muni Papanna and his father Narasappa. Said Muni Papanna and Narasappa sold this land
under registered sale deed dated 13.05.1971 in favour of one Nadumpalli Muneppa. Pursuant to the
sale deed, the alienee was put in possession of the land. The land in question was re-granted in
favour of Muni Papanna on 31.03.1982. This was challenged in appeal and the matter stood
remitted to the Tehsildar to pass fresh orders. Accordingly, fresh re-grant proceedings were taken
up and the land was re-granted in favour of said Muni Papanna and two others. The re- grant in

favour of those two others was challenged by Muni Papanna which challenge was allowed and the
re-grant was confirmed in favour of Muni Papanna alone. Those proceedings attained finality and
became conclusive.
10. Original Suit No.19 of 2004 was filed by the present appellant, being the successor-in- interest of
Nadumpalli Muneppa i.e. the alienee in the Court of Civil Judge, Junior Division Srinivaspuri,
District Kolar. It was submitted that after the re-grant in favour of the original holder, by virtue of
the judgments of the High Court of Karnataka as mentioned herein above, the plaintiff was entitled
to the land in question. It was further submitted that the defendants namely the wife and the
children of Muni Papanna had however executed registered sale deeds in favour of defendants 5 and
6 and that they were seeking to obstruct the possession of the plaintiff. With these assertions, the
plaintiff prayed for declaration that he be declared absolute owner of the land in question and also
prayed for appropriate permanent injunction restraining the defendants from interfering with his
peaceful possession.
11. All the defendants filed common written statement. It was not disputed that there was alienation
in favour of the predecessor of the plaintiff on 28.05.1971 but it was submitted that in proceedings
initiated by Tehsildar under Section 7 of the Act, an order of eviction was passed against the alienee
and that the alienee was evicted from the land on 24.09.1981. It was thus submitted that on re-grant
in favour of Muni Papanna, the benefit must accrue to the heirs of said Papanna alone and that the
plaintiff had no right, title or interest in land in question.
12. The Trial Court by its judgment and order dated 12.02.2007 accepted the claim of the plaintiff
and decreed the suit. Relying on the decisions in Lakshmana Gowda and Syed Bhasheer Ahamed it
was observed that the alienation between 01.02.1963 and 07.08.1978 was not invalid and that the
land having been re-granted in favour of Muni Papanna, the alienee can certainly claim the benefit
by doctrine of feeding the grant by estoppel in view of the re-grant of land in favour of the
alienor/holder of the office under Section 5(1) or 6 of the Act and the subsequent sale deeds in
favour of Defendant Nos.5 and 6 would therefore be of no legal consequence. The suit was decreed
declaring the plaintiff to be absolute owner.
13. The aforesaid decision of the Trial Court was challenged before the Principal District Judge Kolar
in Regular Appeal No.163 of 2007. The lower Appellate Court affirmed the view taken by the Trial
Court and dismissed the appeal by its judgment and order dated 05.01.2008. The respondents
carried the matter further by filing Second Appeal No.323 of 2008 which came to be allowed by
judgment and order dated 27.07.2010. It was observed by the High Court that the alienee having
been evicted from the land on 24.09.1981, as on the date when re-grant was ordered, the possession
was not that of the alienee and as such the courts below were not justified in relying upon the
decisions of the High Court Lakshmana Gowda and Syed Bhasheer Ahamed case. The review
petition preferred by the present appellant was rejected by the High Court vide order dated
1.06.2011.
14. We have heard Mr. Sampat Anand Shetty, learned Advocate for the appellant and Mr. S.N. Bhat,
learned Advocate for the respondents and have gone through the record and considered the rival

submissions. The law on the point as to the rights of an alienee of an Inam land where the alienation
had occurred between 01.02.1963 and 07.08.1978 stands settled by the decisions in Lakshmana
Gowda (supra) and Syed Bhasheer Ahamed (supra).
15. As laid-down in these cases, upon re-grant of the land in favour of the holder of a Service-Inam,
the re-grant must enure to the benefit of the alienee, if such alienation was between 01.02.1963 and
07.08.1978. Further, upon such re-grant, the title of a holder of the Service-inam land would relate
back to the date of coming into force of the Act. In the circumstances, upon re-grant, the title of the
predecessors of the respondents herein would relate back. The alienation effected by them on
13.05.1971, by principles of “feeding the grant by estoppel” would enure to the benefit of the alienee
who would get good title to such land after such re-grant. As observed by the Full-Bench, where the
alienation occurred between 01.02.1963 and 07.08.1978 the alienee would not be “unauthorized
holder”. In the circumstances, the Tehsildar was not competent to initiate proceedings for eviction
under Section 7 of the Act against the alienee, namely, the predecessor-in-interest of the present
appellant. Both the Courts below were, therefore, right and justified in accepting the claim of the
plaintiff-appellant and the High Court was completely in error in setting aside the concurrent view
and allowing the second appeal.
16. We, therefore, allow these appeals. The judgment and orders of the High Court under appeal are
set aside and the judgment and decree passed by the Trial Court in OS No.19 of 2004 as affirmed by
the Appellate Court in Regular Appeal No.163 of 2007 is restored. No orders as to costs.
