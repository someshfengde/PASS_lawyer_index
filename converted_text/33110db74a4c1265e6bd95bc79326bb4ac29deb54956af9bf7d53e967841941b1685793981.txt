3.
Learned counsel for the respondents - BMC submit that the
suit premises is not matching with the assess structure. It is un-
authorized construction. The  trial Court  has passed the  reasoned
order observing that appellant is not entitled for interim relief, the
order passed by the trial court is legal and valid and no interference is
required in it. 
4.
I have heard both learned counsel perused impugned order.
5.
It is contention of learned counsel for the applicant that
structure is standing on the said site since 1961, the trial court has
observed that the assessment is different than the suit premises. In my
view, to consider all these aspects reply of respondent is required.
Hence, I pass following order. 
ORDER
i.
Interim application is allowed. 
ii.
The respondents shall not take coercive action against
the appellant  till next date. Stand over to 13 June,
2023.
iii.
The respondents file reply by next date.
