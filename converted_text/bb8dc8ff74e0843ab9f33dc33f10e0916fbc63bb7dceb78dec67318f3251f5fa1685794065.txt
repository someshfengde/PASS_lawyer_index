By  way  of  filing  the  instant  Criminal  Revision  Petition
challenge  has  been  made  to  the  judgment  dated  30.08.2022
passed  by  the  learned  Additional  Sessions  Judge  No.1,  Nohar,
District Hanumangarh in Criminal appeal No.12/2020, whereby the
learned appellate court affirmed the judgment of conviction and

Case No.607/2010; whereby the petitioner has been convicted for

conducted a Nakabandi at Kalalawali Dahni Circle, Rawatsar. At
about 08.10 p.m., they intercepted a suspected Pickup vehicle.
The driver of the vehicle fled away.  On conducting search of the
vehicle, a huge quantity of liquor was found loaded therein.  The
vehicle and the liquor was seized and an FIR No.467/2010 was
registered at the Police Station Rawatsar.  After usual investigation
a charge-sheet came to be submitted against the petitioner under
Sections 19/54 and Section 54-d of the Rajasthan Excise Act.
3.
The  Learned  Magistrate  framed  charges  against  the
petitioner for the offences under Sections 19/54 and Section 54-d
of  the  Rajasthan  Excise  Act  and  upon  denial  of  guilt  by  the
accused, commenced the trial. During the course of trial, as many
as 8 witnesses were examined and 17 documents were exhibited.
Thereafter, an explanation was sought from the accused-petitioner
under  Section  313  Cr.P.C.  and  then,  after  hearing  the  learned
counsel for the accused petitioner and meticulous appreciation of
the evidence, learned Trial Judge while acquitting him from the
charge under Section 19/54 of the Rajasthan Excise Act, convicted
him for the offence under Section Section 54-d of the Rajasthan
Excise  Act  vide  judgment  dated  24.01.2020.  Aggrieved  by  the
judgment of conviction, he preferred an appeal, which came to be
dismissed  by  the  learned  appellate  court  vide  judgment  dated
30.08.2022  affirming  the  judgment  passed  by  the  trial  court.
Hence, this revision petition is filed before this court.

4.
Learned counsel for the petitioner is not present, however,
looking to the nature of offence and the sentence awarded, this
court deems it fit to examine the merits of the case after hearing
the submissions of the learned Public Prosecutor, who submits that
there  are  concurrent  finding  of  the  two  courts  of  competent
jurisdiction regarding guilt of the petitioner; the prosecution has
proved its case beyond reasonable doubt by producing concrete
evidence; the learned trial court as well as the learned appellate
court have already taken a lenient view by awarding sentence of
one year, therefore, no interference is called for in the impugned
judgment  of  conviction  and  order  of  sentence.   However,  he
admits that it is the first offence of the petitioner and he does not
have have any criminal antecedents.
5.
Having  heard  the  submissions  advanced  by  the  learned
Public  Prosecutor  and  perusing  the  impugned  judgments,  this
court is of the firm opinion that the prosecution has proved its
case  beyond  reasonable  doubt  by  producing  cogent  and
unimpeachable evidence.  The learned appellate court has further
re-appreciated  the  evidence  and  affirmed  the  finding  of  guilt
arrived at by the learned trial court.  Thus, there are concurrent
finding  of  two  courts  of  competent  jurisdiction  regarding
culpability of the accused petitioner.  Thus, this court finds no
reason to interfere in the judgment of conviction. Accordingly, the
judgment of conviction passed by the trial court and affirmed by
the appellate court is maintained.

6.
As far as the question of quantum of sentence in concerned,
it is true that the petitioner has remained behind the bars for
some time during trial. He has not been shown to be indulged in
any other criminal case except this one. Thus, in the light of the
judgments passed by the Honâ€™ble Supreme Court in the cases of
Haripada Das Vs. State of West Bangal reported in (1998) 9
SCC  678 
and
 Alister  Anthony  Pareira  vs.  State  of
Maharashtra reported in 2012 2 SCC 648 and considering the
facts and circumstances of the case, age of appellant, his criminal
antecedents, and the facts that he faced financial hardship and
had to go through mental agony and has been facing the rigour of
trial  for  the  last  13  years,  this  court  deems  it  appropriate  to
reduce  the  sentence  to  the  term  of  imprisonment  that  the
petitioner has already undergone till date.
7.
Accordingly,  the judgment  of  conviction dated  24.01.2020
passed  by  the  learned  Judicial  Magistrate,  Rawatsar,  District
Hanumangarh in Criminal Regular Case No.607/2010 as well as
the judgment of appeal dated 30.08.2022 passed by the learned
Additional Sessions Judge No.1, Nohar, District Hanumangarh in
Criminal  appeal  No.12/2020  are  affirmed  but  the  quantum  of
sentence awarded by the learned Trial Court is modified to the
extent that the sentence the petitioner has undergone till date
would be sufficient and justifiable to serve the interest of justice.
The petitioner is not in judicial custody.  He need not surrender.
His bail bonds are discharged.  If any warrant of arrest has been
issued  against  him,  the  same  shall  be  withdrawn  forthwith.

shall be released forthwith, if not wanted in any other case.

The revision petition is allowed in part.
