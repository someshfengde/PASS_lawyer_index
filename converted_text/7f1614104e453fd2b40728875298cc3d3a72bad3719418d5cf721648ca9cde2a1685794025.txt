ORDER  
02.06.2023. 
 
1.  
The grievance of the petitioners is that being majors, they have 
solemnized their marriage on 23.05.2023 with their free will and without any 
pressure, threat or coercion. Learned counsel for the petitioners submits that the 
respondent Nos. 4 to 5 are continuously harassing and threatening the petitioners 
of dire consequences, despite knowing the fact that the petitioners have 
solemnized their marriage. The petitioners have raised an apprehension of a 
threat to their life at the hands of private respondents. The petitioners have 
placed on record the copies certificates to show their age proofs. The petitioners 
have also placed on record the copy of marriage agreement. 
2.      After hearing the learned counsel for the petitioners and considering the 
aforesaid fact, the present petition can be disposed of with the observation that in 
case the life and liberty of the petitioners is at threat, they shall be at liberty to 
approach the respondent No. 3 i.e., SHO Police Station, Nowshera, Rajouri who

                                                                                                                                         CM No. 3436/2023 
        
 
shall take appropriate steps after proper verification of their age proofs, to 
protect the life and liberty of the petitioners. It is made clear that the order passed 
by this Court shall not, however, be construed as expression of opinion with 
regard to the approval or dis-approval of the marriage of the petitioners.  
3.        The writ petition is, accordingly, disposed of.
