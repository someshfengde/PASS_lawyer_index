1. The issue in these appeals pertains to the question whether the proceeds generated from the sale
of scrap would be included in the total turnover.
2. In the recent decision of this Court in Commissioner of Income Tax Vs. Punjab Stainless Steel
Industries & Ors. reported in [2014] 364 ITR 144 (SC) it has been held that sale proceeds generated
from the sale of scrap would not be included in the total turnover for the purpose of deduction under
Section 80HHC of the Income Tax Act, 1961.
3. The appeals are allowed in terms of the judgment referred to above.
