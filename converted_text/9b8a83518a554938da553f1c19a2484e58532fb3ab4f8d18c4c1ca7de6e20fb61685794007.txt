Criminal Appeal (D.B.) No. 826 of 2023 
 
 
This appeal is directed against the order dated 
15.04.2023 passed by the learned Principal Sessions Judge, 
Pakur in B.P. No. 73/2023, arising out of Pakur (M) P.S. Case 
No. 267/2022 (Misc. Cr. Application No. 402/2023), whereby 
and whereunder the prayer for bail of the appellant has been 
rejected.  
 
 
The appellant is an accused in connection with Pakur 
(M) P.S. Case No. 267/2022.  
 
 
It has been alleged that a bomb had blasted in the 
courtyard of the appellant. The appellant and his family 
members were said to be involved in making of crude bombs.  
 
 
It appears that no injury was suffered by any of the 
persons. The appellant is in custody since 16.02.2023. 
 
 
Regard being had to the above, while setting aside the 
order dated 15.04.2023 passed by the learned Principal 
Sessions Judge, Pakur in B.P. No. 73/2023, we direct that  
  
 
 
 
 
-2- 
the appellant be released on bail on furnishing bail bond of 
Rs. 10,000/- (Rupees Ten Thousand only) with two sureties of 
the like amount each, to the satisfaction of learned S.D.J.M., 
Pakur in connection with Pakur (M) P.S. Case No. 267/2022 
(Misc. Cr. Application No. 402/2023). 
 
 
This appeal stands allowed.
