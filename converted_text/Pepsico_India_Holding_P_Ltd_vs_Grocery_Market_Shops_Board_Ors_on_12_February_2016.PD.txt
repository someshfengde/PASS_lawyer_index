1. These appeals involve an interpretation of the provisions of the Maharashtra Mathadi, Hamal and
Other Manual Workers (Regulation of Employment and Welfare) Act, 1969, (hereinafter referred to
as “the 1969 Act”) read with the Grocery Markets or Shops Unprotected Workers (Regulation of
Employment and Welfare) Scheme, 1970 (hereinafter referred to as “the 1970 Scheme”). The brief
facts necessary for a decision in Civil Appeal No.10000 Of 2010 (Supreme Petro-Chem Limited v.
State of Maharashtra and others) are that under Section 5 of the said 1969 Act, if any question arises
whether any scheme applies to any class of unprotected workers, the matter shall be referred to the
State Government and the decision of the State Government which shall be taken after consulting
the Advisory Committee constituted under Section 14 shall be final. By an order dated 24.6.2008,
the State Government after referring to submissions from the appellants as well as submissions
from the Board, held:-

“4. Govt has analyzed overall situation, documents application of the organization dated 01.03.2003
and information about the product and its raw material. Govt has come to the following conclusion:
a. Company is manufacturing Polystyrene.
b. For manufacturing styrene and Polybutadin are used as raw material. Polybutadin comes in
rubber form and it is not natural rubber.
c. Polystyrene is a hard plastic.
d. Polystyrene is not a petrochemical product but a chemical product.
e. Even Polystyrene manufacturing is considered as petrochemical production it is finally a chemical
production only. The material used to manufacture the product is also chemical.
f. There is no written reference in the Mathadi Act that petrochemical should be kept out of the act
but chemical itself includes everything.
g. Mathadi Act and scheme is for the betterment of workers and purpose of the scheme is to make
applicable to the chemical manufacturing companies. It is not mentioned in the scheme that
petrochemical products should be excluded and as petrochemical is not mentioned in the scheme so
the scheme is not applicable to the said organization is not acceptable.
5. In the situation Samitte and Govt. has come to the conclusion that Grocery market and shops
unprotected workers (Regulation of Employment and Welfare) Act 1970 is applicable to Supreme
Petrochem Ltd.
6. In the company loading unloading work of chemical product and its raw material is carried out.
And with respect to this Mathadi kind of work is carried out in the company. As said by the company
this work is carried out by two Cooperative societies. These societies do the work by employing the
workers and get compensation from the company. Company says that these employees get the
facilities like Provident fund and others. But in the report filed by the mandal on 20.09.2006 this
statement has not been proved. As per the decision given by Hon. High Court in 2006 (3) CLR PG
999, there is no meaning to what company is saying. Instead of that it proves that in the said
company Mathadi kind of work carries out.
8. In this situation Maharashtra Mathadi Hamal and other Manual Workers (Regulation of
Employment and Welfare) Act 1969, Grocery Markets or Shops Unprotected Workers (Regulation of
employment and welfare) Scheme 1970 is applicable to the said organization. Therefore, application
given under section 5 of Mathadi Act is rejected by the Government.”
2. The said order was challenged before the Bombay High Court by filing a writ petition. The writ
petition was dismissed by the impugned judgment dated 10.2.2009 after holding:-

“4. It is rather difficult to digest the arguments of the learned counsel. Basically, what we find is that
the petitioners are manufacturing polysterene and polysterene is a combination of styrene and
polybutadin. Polybutadin comes in rubber form and is not a petrochemical though it is not a natural
rubber. Styrene is one of the by-product of the petrochemical which is used by the petitioner for
manufacturing polysterene. Therefore, the petitioners are not manufacturing any petrochemicals,
but one of the by-product of the petrochemical is used by the petitioners to manufacture polysterene
and polysterene is hard plastic.
5. All these aspects have been considered by the Government authorities and thereafter the
authorities concluded that the petitioners are not dealing with petrochemicals as they have
submitted. We agree with the findings of the authority. Assuming for a moment that the petitioners
are dealing in petrochemicals, yet the Act will be applicable to them because the words used in this
application clause referred to above is the product including the manures and thereby, every type of
production has been covered. What is important to note is that the manures which are like urea etc.
are also derivatives of the petrochemicals and thereby by inclusive clause the manures which could
have been saved probably have been included there. Therefore, the word “product” has been used by
the Legislature in its wisdom with all its cognate variations and it cannot be interpreted to have a
limited meaning. What we find is that the petrochemical is a part of the chemical. Chemical is the
genesis while petrochemical is species of the said genesis and thereby if the chemical industry is
covered it is rather difficult to hold that the petrochemical industries are not covered.
6. What is important to be looked into is whether in this industry the work which the mathadis are
carrying out is available or not. If, in that industry, the work of mathadis is available then only
because the industry is dealing in some different aspect, that work cannot be given to some other
unorganized workers. The basic test, after having ascertained that the industry is covered by law, is
to find out that the work of mathadis is available and if it is available, the Act and the Scheme will
apply to the industry. It is not disputed that the mathadi work is not available. The only distinction
which was tried to be made out was with regard to petrochemicals and that, therefore, the Act is not
applicable, which submission we have already rejected for the reasons stated above. We find that the
Government has rightly decided the matter under Section 5 and no interference is called for at the
hands of this court.”
3. Shri J.P. Cama, learned senior advocate appearing on behalf of the appellants has argued that the
1969 Act only applies to employments that are specified in the Schedule. Inasmuch as grocery
markets or shops are mentioned in Item 4 of the Schedule, according to learned counsel,
employment in factories which occurs only in Item 5 of the said Schedule could not possibly be
attracted as Item 5 only speaks of establishments which are not covered by any other entries in the
Schedule. Inasmuch as the 1970 Scheme in the present case is a scheme dealing with employment in
grocery markets or shops, Item 5 of the Schedule is not attracted, and the 1970 Scheme is ultra vires
the 1969 Act insofar as it provides for employment in factories which manufacture chemical
products and are covered by entry 5 of the Schedule to the said 1969 Act. He also referred to Section
1(4A) of the 1969 Act to state that insofar as employment in factories in district Raigad are
concerned, item 5 in column 4 of the table appended to Section 1(4A) speaks of “colour chemicals”
and “products including fertilizers”, and not “chemical products”. This being so, chemical products

in any case are outside Section 1(4A), and the 1970 Scheme insofar as it purports to include within it
under clause 2(1)(f) “chemical products”, is therefore ultra vires Section 1(4A). Further, according to
learned counsel, what is allegedly manufactured in the appellant’s factory are petro chemicals and
not chemicals. He has referred to a number of documents which include various licences and letters
from authorities clearly stating that what is manufactured in the appellant’s factory are only petro
chemicals. For that reason also, petro chemicals not being chemicals would not be within the
coverage of the 1969 Act or the 1970 Scheme. He further argued, referring to Section 4(1)(b) of the
1969 Act that if the 1970 Scheme is to be made applicable to petro chemicals manufactured in
factories, the only method of doing so is if a demand or request is made by a majority of the
employers or workers that the provisions of the grocery markets or shops scheme should be applied
to another scheduled employment – that is, manufacturing petro chemicals in factories, and it is
only after consultation with the employers and workers that the State Government may apply the
provisions of the 1970 Scheme to the appellant’s factory manufacturing petro chemicals. This not
having been done, the 1970 Scheme cannot apply to the appellant. Learned counsel further argued
that in point of fact there is no work of transportation undertaken by the employer from the
employer’s factory to the purchaser’s premises. He argued that the factory was by and large
mechanised and that the petro chemical products manufactured at the factory were picked up by
purchasers by employing contract labour that was arranged by the purchasers themselves. This
being so, the 1969 Act and the 1970 Scheme would have no application to the appellant’s factory.
4. Shri S. Chinchwadkar, learned advocate appearing on behalf of the respondent-Board has
countered each of the arguments of Mr. Cama. According to Shri Chinchwadkar Entry 5 appearing
in the Schedule to the 1969 Act is a residuary entry which takes in all employments not otherwise
covered by any scheme under any of the other items of the Schedule, and as petro chemicals
manufactured in factories were admittedly not covered by any of the other items, they would fall
within the residuary entry. Further, according to learned counsel, the nomenclature of the scheme is
irrelevant so long as the provisions of the 1970 Scheme actually cover the appellant’s activities
carried out in factories. He further argued referring to Sections 3 and 4 of the 1969 Act that there
can be a composite scheme in which several scheduled employments or groups of employments can
be bunched together, which has been done in the present case. He also argued with reference to
Section 1(4A) that item 5 in column 4 when it referred to “products including fertilizers” would
include all products including chemical products, and that therefore the 1970 Scheme is intra vires
the 1969 Act. He also referred to the State Government order, which was impugned before the High
Court and upheld, in order to show that the State Government had applied its mind under Section 5
of the 1969 Act, and that such order should not be interfered with in the exercise of judicial review
under Article 226 of the Constitution. He also referred us to the definition of “establishment”
contained in section 2(4) which would mean “any place or premises including the precincts thereof
in which any scheduled employment is being carried on”. According to him, inasmuch as lifting of
the appellant’s product was being carried on from the precincts of the factory, the appellant would
be covered by the 1969 Act and the 1970 Scheme. He also referred in some detail to Bhuwalka Steel
Industries Limited v. Bombay Iron & Steel Labour Board, (2010) 2 SCC 273 to buttress his
proposition that this Court, following the Full Bench of the Bombay High Court, has construed the
1969 Act as a welfare legislation, and having regard to its object has expressly stated that employers
should realise their social obligations qua this segment of workers who are non-protected workers,

as defined by the said Act.
5. We have heard learned counsel for the parties. Before entering into the merits of the controversy
before us, we would like to set out the relevant provisions of the 1969 Act and the 1970 Scheme
made thereunder. The long title of the 1969 Act is important in that it sets out the object for which
the 1969 Act was enacted, and is as follows:-
“An Act for regulating the employment of unprotected manual workers employed in certain
employments in the State of Maharashtra to make provision for their adequate supply and proper
and full utilization in such employments, and for matters connected therewith. WHEREAS, it is
expedient to regulate the employment of unprotected manual workers such as, Mathadi, Hamal etc.,
engaged in certain employments, to make better provision for their terms and conditions of
employments, to provide for their welfare, and for health and safety measures where such
employments require these measures; to make provision for ensuring an adequate supply to, and
full and proper utilization of, such workers in such employments to prevent avoidable
unemployment; for these and similar purposes, to provide for the establishment of Boards in respect
of these employments and (where necessary) in the different areas of the State; and to provide for
purpose connected with the matters aforesaid; It is hereby enacted in the Twentieth Year of the
Republic of India as follows: -
The Sections of the Act relevant for deciding these appeals are set out hereinbelow and read as
follows:
“1. Short title, extent, application and commencement. – (3) It applies to the employments specified

approval of the State Government.”
7. The first contention of Shri Cama, that the 1970 Scheme, insofar as it provides for employment in
a factory manufacturing chemical products, is ultra vires the Schedule to the 1969 Act, has to be
rejected. We agree with learned counsel for the respondent that clause 5 of the Schedule to the Act is
a residuary clause which would rope in employment in factories in connection with loading,
unloading, etc. carried on by workers not covered by any other entries in the Schedule. Admittedly,
manufacture of petro chemicals in factories is not covered by any other entry including entry 4 to
the Schedule. For this reason, we are of the view that the provisions of the 1970 Scheme dealing with
manufacture of petro chemicals in factories would be within the coverage of the residuary entry i.e.
Item 5 of the Schedule to the 1969 Act. This being so, no part of the 1970 Scheme is ultra vires the
1969 Act.
8. The second submission of learned counsel for the appellant has also to be rejected for the reason
that clause 2(1)(f) of the 1970 Scheme is intra vires Section 1(4A) table column 4 item 5 of the 1969
Act. It is clear that the expression “products including fertilizers” is wider than “chemical products
including fertilizers”. The 1969 Act’s terminology being wider than the terminology of the impugned
1970 Scheme, obviously the 1970 Scheme when it speaks of “chemical products” manufactured in
factories and covered by entry 5 in the schedule to the 1969 Act would be intra vires the expression
“products including fertilizers”.
9. The further submission of Shri Cama, learned senior counsel, that the appellant allegedly
manufactures petro chemical products and not chemical products has been correctly repelled by the
Pepsico India Holding P.Ltd vs Grocery Market & Shops Board & Ors on 12 February, 2016
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/120419502/
11
Division Bench of the Bombay High Court by stating that “petro chemical products” would be a
species of the genus “chemical products”. In fact, the appellant has admitted that it manufactures
polystyrene (granules). Polystyrene in turn has been described as an inexpensive and hard plastic
which is a vinyl polymer. In the report of the working group on chemicals and petro chemicals in the
11th Five Year Plan from 2007-2008 to 2011-2012 made by the Department of Chemicals and Petro
Chemicals, it is stated:-
“1. Petrochemicals are derived from various chemical compounds, mainly hydrocarbons. These
hydrocarbons are derived from crude oil and natural gas. Among the various fractions produced by
distillation of crude oil, petroleum gases, naphtha, kerosene and gas oil are the main feedstocks for
the petrochemical industry. Ethane and natural gas liquids obtained from natural gas are the other
important feedstocks used in the petrochemical industry. Olefins (Ethylene, Propylene & Butadiene)
and Aromatics (Benzene, Toluene & Xylenes) are the major building blocks from which most
petrochemicals are produced.
2. Petrochemical manufacturing involves manufacture of building blocks by cracking or reforming
operation; conversion of building blocks into intermediates such as fibre intermediates
(Acrylonitrile, Caprolactum, Dimethyl Terephthalate/Purified Terephthalic Acid, Mono Ethylene
Glycol); precursors (Styrene, Ethylene Dichloride, Vinyl Chloride Monomer etc.) and other chemical
intermediates; production of synthetic fibers, plastics, elastomers, other chemicals and processing of
plastics to produce consumer and industrial products.
10. A perusal of the aforesaid report shows that not only are petro chemicals derived from various
chemical compounds, but also that petro chemical manufacturing involves among other things the
production of plastics. In fact, in a report made by the Inquiry Officer appointed under Section 13 of
the Act, the authorized officer came to the conclusion:
“Under these circumstances, my opinion is that polystyrene production is not a petroleum product
but it is a chemical or chemical product. For a moment if it is accepted that company is a
petrochemical company and producing petrochemical, even though petrochemical is also one of the
chemical and therefore no reason is seen for not accepting a chemical production and Mathadi Act
and Scheme are not applicable. After all petrochemicals are chemicals. It is not mentioned anywhere
that petrochemicals should be omitted while implementing Mathadi Act and Scheme. Under the
circumstances, I am giving my ruling that company’s above point is not valid and hence Mathadi Act
and Scheme is applicable to the company.”
11. From the above, it is clear that the conclusion reached by the Government in its order dated
24.6.2008 that petro-chemical products are a species of chemical products and that the appellant
manufactures chemical products, cannot be said to be perverse. We must not forget that the High
Court in dismissing the writ petition was exercising the power of judicial review which would not go
to the merits of the controversy before the Government but would only go to perversity –that no
reasonable person invested with the same power could possibly arrive at the conclusion arrived at by
the Government. Even otherwise, we must not forget that we are dealing with a welfare legislation
whose primary object is to provide adequate employment for and better terms and conditions for
Pepsico India Holding P.Ltd vs Grocery Market & Shops Board & Ors on 12 February, 2016
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/120419502/
12
the employment of daily wagers, and to provide for their general welfare, which includes health and
the safety measures, and to provide them with various other facilities including provident fund and
gratuity. Arguments indulging in unnecessary hairsplitting have therefore necessarily to be
dismissed out of hand.
12. Another submission made by learned senior counsel appearing on behalf of the appellant is that
the 1970 Scheme deals with grocery markets or shops as its title suggests and cannot therefore
include within it’s scope petro chemicals manufactured in factories without following the drill of
Section 4(1)(b) of the 1969 Act. This argument again has to be rejected for the reason that both
Sections 3 and 4 of the Act refer to a scheme which provides for registration of unprotected workers
“in any scheduled employment or employments” (as per Section 3(1) of the 1969 Act). Further,
Section 4(1) of the 1969 Act also makes it clear that the State Government may make one or more
Schemes for any scheduled employment or group of scheduled employments. On a reading of these
provisions it becomes clear that there can be a composite scheme which takes within its ken various
employments which may be contained in more than one entry of the Schedule to the 1969 Act. This
being so, it is clear that merely naming a particular composite scheme as a grocery market or shop
scheme does not carry the matter further. It is clear that the present scheme specifically takes within
its ken factories manufacturing chemical products covered by entry 5 in the schedule to the 1969
Act, and would therefore be a scheme which provides for registration of unprotected workers in
different scheduled employments and/or a group of scheduled employments. This being the case, it
is clear that the attack based on nomenclature of the 1970 Scheme as a grocery market or shops
scheme must fail.
13. We also agree with learned counsel for the respondent that Section 2(4) of the 1969 Act, which
defines “establishment”, would not only include any place or premises in which manufacture of
petro chemicals is being carried on, but would also include the precincts thereof, which would
include transportation made beyond the factory gate but within the precincts of the factory. This
being the case, it is common ground that workers are necessary and are being used by the appellant
to load the appellant’s products on to the vehicles provided by the appellant’s purchasers. This being
the case, any argument that the factories’ manufacturing activities are mechanized and that there is
no need for manual labour would have no material bearing to the case at hand.
14. This Court, while approving a Full Bench decision of the Bombay High Court, has in the
Bhuwalka Steel case interpreted the expression “unprotected worker” occurring in Section 2(11) of
the 1969 Act as meaning every manual worker who is engaged or to be engaged in any scheduled
employment, irrespective of whether or not he is protected by other labour legislations. This Court
referred to the Objects and Reasons for the 1969 Act in the following terms:
“The Statement of Objects and Reasons mentions that report was made by the Committee to the
Government on 17.11.1967. In that report, it was mentioned that the persons engaged in vocations
like mathadi, hamals, casual workers employed in docks, lokhandi jatha workers, salt pan workers
and other manual workers mostly work outside fixed premises in the open and are mostly engaged
on piece-rate system in a number of cases. They are not employed directly, but are either engaged
through Mukadum or Toliwalas or gangs as and when there is work and they also work for different
Pepsico India Holding P.Ltd vs Grocery Market & Shops Board & Ors on 12 February, 2016
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/120419502/
13
employers on one and the same day. The volume of work is not always constant. In view of the
peculiar nature of work, its variety, the precarious means of employment and the system of payment
and the particular vulnerability to exploitation of this class of labour, the Committee had come to
the conclusion that the application of the various labour laws to such workers was impracticable and
regulation of their working and other conditions by introducing amendments to the existing labour
laws was not possible. Therefore, the Committee recommended that the working and the
employment conditions of such unprotected workers should be regulated by a special enactment.
The Statement of Objects and Reasons further mentions that after holding series of meetings with
the representatives of the interests affected by the proposed legislation and after considering all
these suggestions and examining the recommendations of the Committee, Government had decided
to bring the Bill which seeks to regulate the employment of mathadis, hamals and other manual
workers employed in certain employments, to make better provision for their terms and conditions
of employment, to provide for their welfare, for health and safety measures, where such
employments require those measures, to make provision for ensuring an adequate supply to, and
full and proper utilization of such workers in such employments, to prevent avoidable
unemployment and for such purposes to provide for the establishment of Boards in respect of these
employments and (where necessary) in the different areas of the State and to provide for purposes
connected with the matters aforesaid. (emphasis supplied)” (at Paras 9 and 10)
15. After construing Section 2(11) of the 1969 Act to cover all “unprotected workers”, i.e. all manual
labour engaged in any scheduled employment irrespective of protection under other Labour
Legislation, this Court went on to hold:-
“Before parting with the judgment, we must refer to the fact that this legislation, which came way
back in 1969, has in its view, those poor workmen, who were neither organized to be in a position to
bargain with the employers nor did they have the compelling bargaining power. They were mostly
dependent upon the Toliwalas and the Mukadams. They were not certain that they would get the
work everyday. They were also not certain that they would work only for one employer in a day.
Everyday was a challenge to these poor workmen. It was with this idea that the Board was created
under Section 6 of the Mathadi Act. Deep thoughts have gone into, creating the framework of the
Boards, of the schemes etc. With these lofty ideas that the Act was brought into existence. In these
days when Noble Laureate Professor Mohd. Yunus of Bangladesh is advocating the theory of social
business as against the business to earn maximum profits, it would be better if the employers could
realize their social obligations, more particularly, to the have-nots of the society, the workers who
are all contemplated to be the inflicted workers in the Act.” (at Para 83)
16. Taking a cue from the Objects and Reasons for this piece of social legislation and from the well
known doctrine of construing such legislation in an expansive manner to further the object of
welfare Legislation of the kind mentioned hereinabove, and not to stultify such object, we hold that
the Bombay High Court cannot be faulted in its reasoning. It must also not be forgotten that the
object of the 1970 Scheme is not only to provide work to both employer and employee but also to
provide amenities and benefits to registered workers. These amenities and benefits are to be
provided by the Board to employees by charging the employer with a levy which cannot exceed 50%
Pepsico India Holding P.Ltd vs Grocery Market & Shops Board & Ors on 12 February, 2016
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/120419502/
14
of the total wage bill of the employer without the prior approval of the State Government. We are
told that in the present case the levy amount is 41%, which is utilized not only to look after the
health of the workers, but also to give them terminal benefits such as provident fund and gratuity
provided for by clause 43 of the 1970 Scheme.
17. It was further submitted by Shri Cama that on a conjoint reading of the definitions of
“employer”, “principal employer” and “worker” contained in Sections 2(3), (7), (12), as the two
societies are contractors employing contract labour for and on behalf of the appellant company’s
purchasers, the appellant company cannot be said to be the “principal employer” who is liable to be
registered under the 1969 Act. We are afraid that this contention does not lie in the mouth of the
appellant company. By an application made for registration under the 1969 Act dated 11.10.1996, in
column No.7 which reads as follows:-
“7. Are you employing workers through contractors? If so, state the name of the contractors” the
Company has specifically mentioned two cooperative societies and one other contractor thereby
admitting that it actually employed about 30 workers itself through contractors.
18. By a letter dated 1.3.2003, i.e. almost 7 years after the appellant company had been registered as
an employer under the 1969 Act, the appellant company applied to remove its name from the
register contained in the 1969 Act. This was followed up by a representation dated 10.5.2004 in
which the appellant company stated:-
“The company, although did not engage any mathadi workmen, in view of the prosecution,
registered itself on 11/10/1996, and was issued Registration No.4516. After registration, the
Company with a view to close the matter pleaded guilty in the proceedings filed by the Board before
the Labour Court. The Company submits that no Toli was allotted to it in spite of being registered
till 21/3/2001, as the Board was well aware that the Company itself did not engage any persons for
loading trucks and that the truckers/customers engaged persons from the Societies for loading
work. The Company conducted and continued its business as usual and sold its products on ex-work
basis whereby the customer as earlier sent Truckers along with persons who were from the Societies
for loading.”
19. Similarly in the writ petition filed before the High Court, the appellant company’s own pleading
in paragraph 8 is that the appellant registered itself with the respondent No.2 Board under pressure
of the Board believing that the Act and the scheme were applicable. It was granted registration
No.4516. Further, in proceedings under the Act against the company it admitted that it pleaded
guilty for not having registered itself. This being the state of facts before us, we cannot characterize
the State Government’s finding in its order dated 24.6.2008 as even incorrect, let alone perverse. As
pointed out above, in paragraph 6 of its order, the State Government specifically arrived at a finding
that Mathadi work was carried out in the company by two cooperative societies who had the work
done by employing workers and got compensated by the appellant company. This being the case,
there is no factual foundation for Shri Cama’s argument that it is the appellant’s purchasers and not
the appellant company itself that is the principal employer under the Act.
Pepsico India Holding P.Ltd vs Grocery Market & Shops Board & Ors on 12 February, 2016

15
20. One other contention of Shri Cama needs to be noticed. Shri Cama argued before us that the
1969 Act being inconsistent with the Contract Labour (Regulation and Abolition) Act, 1970 would be
repugnant to the said Act and therefore invalid under Article 254 of the Constitution. He candidly
admitted that no such ground had been raised or argued before the High Court, but asked that the
Supreme Court allow him to raise this plea as it is a pure question of law. We are afraid that this is
not possible for the reason that even if Shri Cama were to be correct in his submission that the
Central Parliamentary Act of 1970 would impliedly repeal the 1969 State Act, yet Section 30(1) of the
said Act provides that despite the provisions of the 1970 Act being allegedly inconsistent with the
1969 State Act, yet if contract labour employed in an establishment are entitled to benefits which are
more favourable to them than those to which they would be entitled under the 1970 Act, the contract
labour shall continue to be entitled to more favourable benefits, notwithstanding that they also
receive benefits in respect of other matters under the Central Parliamentary Act. This being the case,
it was incumbent upon the writ petitioner not only to take up the plea of repugnancy and implied
repeal but also to state as a fact that what the workmen would be entitled to under the 1969 State
Act would not be as beneficial as what they would be entitled to under the 1970 Central enactment.
This would then give the respondent Board, in turn, an opportunity of either admitting or denying
this factual averment. There being no pleading to this effect in the writ petition before the High
Court, it is clear that it is not possible for us to accede to Shri Cama’s request to go into the
argument on repugnancy and implied repeal.
21. This appeal is, accordingly, dismissed.
Civil Appeal No.9999 of 2010
22. In this appeal, the fact situation is that the appellant company is manufacturing soft drinks
being aerated water and bottled water. A State Government order dated 18.8.2008 made under
Section 5 of the Act rendered the following finding:-
“5. The Government has perused all the case papers and considered the above circumstances. After
examining all the aspects of the case the Government has arrived at the following findings:-
(a) The company products drinking water and drinks of various kinds such as Pepsi, Mirinda and
Seven-up.
(b) In the said products the Company uses as raw material such as Sugar, Caustic Soda, Carbonic
Acid; Ascorbic Acid; Coffin, Sequesters Agents, Buffering; Carmel Water, Emulsifying and
Stabilizing.
(c) “Drink” is one of the substances of food products;
(d) “Drink” is a grocery product;
(e) The raw material from which they are produced are also primarily consumable food products.
Pepsico India Holding P.Ltd vs Grocery Market & Shops Board & Ors on 12 February, 2016
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/120419502/
16
(f) The raw material required for the manufacture of the product as also the product manufactured
are both consumable food products (liquid and solid).
(g) Mathadi Act and the Scheme famed thereunder being beneficent and benevolent welfare
Schemes and the object is to make the same applicable to the companies manufacturing grocery
market products as provided in the Grocery Markets & Shops Unprotected Workers (Regulation of
Employment and Welfare) Scheme, 1970.
6. In the above circumstances, the State has come to the finding that the Scheme of the Grocery
Bazar and Shops Workers Board is applicable to the Company.
7. The company is engaged in products of drinks and drinking water and consequently in carrying
on works in the nature of Mathadi such also loading, unloading, stacking, carrying setting up of raw
material. The said works was carried out by 49 workers of contractor M/s M.M. Patil under the
supervision the Grocery Board Supervisor. The said workers, excepting their wages, were deprived
of P.F. contribution, paid holidays, house rent, workmen’s compensation, bonus and other medical
benefits. In these circumstances, the provisions of the Maharashtra Mathadi, Hamal and other
Manual Workers (Regulation of Employment and Welfare) Act, 1969 and the Grocery Markets or
Shops Unprotected Workers (Regulation of Employment and Welfare) Scheme, 1970 are applicable
to your establishment. Therefore, the application made by you to the Government under the
provisions of section 5 of the Mathadi Act is rejected.”
23. A writ petition filed against the said order before the Bombay High Court failed. The High Court
dismissed the petition as follows:-
“The second submission is that the petitioners are manufacturing Soft Drinks like Pepsi, Mirinda,
Seven-up etc. and it is not a grocery items. It is not disputed before this court that in the
manufacturing process of these soft drinks, the petitioners are using sugar, carbonic acid, ascorbic
acid, coffin, sequestrates agents. The petitioners are using caustic soda for cleaning bottles. But we
find that these soft drinks are provided to refresh persons and to provide energy to them when they
are exhausted. The items, like sugar or carbonic hydride provide energy. It is also not disputed that
all these items used in the manufacturing process are the grocery items and accordingly the State
Government has also made observations that these are the grocery items. Apart from that the
Oxford Dictionary has given the meaning of “grocery”. According to said dictionary “Grocery” means
items of food in a grocery shop or a super- market. Now-a-days, all the Soft Drinks are available in
the grocery shops and the super-markets. They are the items of food and, therefore, they are all
grocery items. Apart from this, it is not disputed by the learned counsel that in all the manufacturing
process, loading and unloading activities are carried out, which are the activities of the Mathadi
Kamgara. We do not find any substance in the contentions raised. The writ petition is rejected.”
24. Shri Giri, in addition to the submissions raised by Shri Cama, on his special facts submitted that
it was fallacious to take into account raw materials that ultimately went into the manufacturing of
the finished products and to state that the said raw materials being groceries would therefore make
the final product also a “grocery”. He further argued that the expression “grocery” would only
Pepsico India Holding P.Ltd vs Grocery Market & Shops Board & Ors on 12 February, 2016
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/120419502/
17
comprise articles which are required as daily necessities such as oil, grain, etc. in households, and
this not being the case, soft drinks manufactured and bottled water would be outside the expression
“grocery”. He also argued that when the Act was extended to the appellant company’s factory, in the
year 1983, whatever may be the position today, the position in 1983 was clear and obviously the
items manufactured by the appellant company would not have fallen within the expression “grocery”
as understood in 1983.
25. Learned counsel appearing on behalf of the Board has repelled all these arguments stating that
the expression “grocery” was wide enough to include all items of food and drink which would
necessarily take in the appellant company’s products. He reiterated his argument on construing a
beneficial enactment such as the 1969 Act to achieve the object set out and that assuming that the
term “grocery” has a narrower meaning, obviously the broader meaning should be taken into
account. Further, he also stated that whatever the position was in 1983, at the stage of the show
cause notice in 2005 and by the date of the State Government order in 2008 both soft drinks
manufactured as well as bottled water manufactured by the appellant company were certainly
household items among the middle class and rich sections of society.
26. The definition of “grocery” contained in the Oxford Advanced Learner’s Dictionary of Current
English, 9th Edition, is as follows:-
“grocery – (grocery store) a shop/store that sells food and other things used in the home. In
American English ‘grocery store’ is often used to mean supermarket. 2. Groceries – food and other
goods sold by a grocer or at a supermarket.” We also find a useful definition contained in Collins
English Dictionary, Third Edition – “groceries – merchandise, esp. Foodstuffs, sold by a grocer”.
27. That the expression “grocery” in 2005, when the Act was sought to be applied to the appellant
company, would include soft drinks manufactured by the appellant company and bottled water as
daily household goods among the middle class and rich sections of society, was not seriously
contested by Shri Giri. The argument that we should find the meaning of the expression “grocery” on
the date on which the Act was extended to the area in which the appellant company’s factory was
situate is fallacious in law. This Court in The Senior Electric Inspector and others v. Laxmi Narayan
Chopra and others, 1962 (3) S.C.R. 146, when confronted with a similar argument to that made by
Shri Giri, repelled the said argument in the following terms:
“The legal position may be summarized thus: The maxim contemporanea expositio as laid down by
Coke was applied to construing ancient statutes but not to interpreting Acts which are comparatively
modern. There is a good reason for this change in the mode of interpretation. The fundamental rule
of construction is the same whether the Court is asked to construe a provision of an ancient statute
or that of a modern one, namely, what is the expressed intention of the Legislature. It is perhaps
difficult to attribute to a legislative body functioning in a static society that its intention was couched
in terms of considerable breadth so as to take within its sweep the future developments
comprehended by the phraseology used. It is more reasonable to confine its intention only to the
circumstances obtaining at the time the law was made. But in a modern progressive society it would
be unreasonable to confine the intention of a Legislature to the meaning attributable to the word

used at the time the law was made, for a modern Legislature making laws to govern a society which
is fast moving must be presumed to be aware of an enlarged meaning the same concept might
attract with the march of time and with the revolutionary changes brought about in social,
economic, political and scientific and other fields of human activity. Indeed, unless a contrary
intention appears, an interpretation should be given to the words used to take in new facts and
situations, if the words are capable of comprehending them. We cannot, therefore, agree with the
learned Judges of the High Court that the maxim contemporanea expositio could be invoked in
construing the word “telegraph line” in the Act.” (at 156, 157)
28. We thus find that the High Court was absolutely correct in not interfering with the State
Government order dated 18.8.2008 and in dismissing the writ petition filed by the appellant
company. For the same reasons given in Civil Appeal No.10000 of 2010, we therefore reject this
appeal as well. The appeal is, accordingly, dismissed, with no order as to costs.
