Etc.
has set aside the direction under Section 212(14) of the Act, 2013 dated 29.05.2019 issued by the

Factual Background:
2. The facts leading to the present proceedings in nutshell are as under:
A series of defaults by the IL&FS Group Companies, which had an aggregate debt burden of more
than Rs. 91,000 crores, occurred between June to September, 2018 and threatened to collapse the
money markets of India, added pressure to corporate bond yields and sparked a sell off in the stock
market. The Department of Economic Affairs, Ministry of Finance issued an Office Memorandum
dated 30.09.2018 in respect of IL&FS to the Ministry of Corporate Affairs, Union of India requesting
it to take action under the Act, 2013. The Memorandum and Note highlighted that:
(a)the IL&FS Group was struggling with a debt contagion of approx.. Rs. 91,000
crores across the IL&FS Group against Rs. 6950 crores in equity share capital and
reserves a leverage of at least 13 times.

Criminal Appeal Nos.2305-2307/2022 Etc.
Moreover, in the year 2017-18, the IL&FS Group has shown a loss of Rs. 2670 crores;
(b) this debt contagion, prima facie, was on account of inter alia failure of corporate governance
across the IL&FS Group and window dressed accounts; and
(c) any further defaults would be catastrophic for the well-being of the financial markets and the
economy.
2.1 In parallel, the Ministry of Corporate Affairs, upon receipt of a report from the Registrar of
Companies under Section 208 of the Act, 2013, directed the SFIO to investigate into the affairs of
IL&FS and its subsidiaries.
2.2 The Ministry of Corporate Affairs filed a Company Petition on 01.10.2018 being Company
Petition No. 3638/2018 against IL&FS and its the then existing Board of Directors before the
National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT) seeking, amongst others, the removal of the then existing
Board of Directors of IL&FS and the appointment of a new Board of Directors in place and instead
thereof. The NCLT passed an interim order on the same date, i.e., 01.10.2018 superseding the then
existing Board of Directors of IL&FS with a new Board of Directors. The Criminal Appeal
Nos.2305-2307/2022 Etc.
new Board of Directors were directed to take charge of the affairs of the IL&FS. The new Board of
Directors of IL&FS submitted a report dated 30.10.2018 on progress and way forward with the
Ministry of Corporate Affairs which was in turn filed by the Ministry of Corporate Affairs with the
NCLT on 31.10.2018, pursuant to the order passed by the NCLT on 01.10.2018.
2.3 Further to the Office Order dated 30.09.2018 directing investigation to be initiated by the SFIO
and an e-mail dated 01.11.2018, SFIO submitted an interim report in respect of IL&FS and one
Employees Welfare Trust pertaining to the IL&FS Group. It is required to be noted that the said
interim report was submitted as Ministry of Corporate Affairs called for an “interim report”, which
was called in pursuance to Section 212(11) of the Act, 2013 which provides that an interim report
must be called for by the Central Government. It is to be noted that in the interim report itself, it
was specifically recorded that the findings in the interim report are interim findings and the interim
report concluded by setting forth “based on the above interim findings…” It is also to be noted that
interim report was on the individuals who were in control Criminal Appeal Nos.2305-2307/2022
Etc.
of the affairs of the IL&FS Group and the illegalities and fraud perpetrated by them.
2.4 On the basis of the interim report, the Ministry of Corporate Affairs filed a Miscellaneous
Application in Company Petition No. 3638/2018 against the erstwhile Directors of the companies in
the IL&FS Group seeking to implead them in the said proceedings and an order to attach their
immovable/movable properties.

2.5 On the basis of the interim report and a prima facie opinion of the Institute of Chartered
Accountants dated 04.12.2018, the Ministry of Corporate Affairs filed a petition under section 130 of
the Companies Act, 2018 before the NCLT praying inter alia that the books of accounts of IL&FS,
IFIN and IL&FS Transportation Networks Limited (ITNL) may be re-opened and recast. Vide order
dated 01.01.2019 passed in Section 130 petition, the NCLT directed that the accounts of IL&FS, IFIN
& ITNL for the past 5 financial years be re-opened and recast on the ground that the affairs of
IL&FS, IFIN & ITNL had been mismanaged casting a doubt on the reliability of the financial
statements/accounts.
Criminal Appeal Nos.2305-2307/2022 Etc.
2.6 The auditors of IFIN (BSR & Deloitte) were given notice of Section 130 petition who opposed the
said petition. Order dated 01.01.2019 passed by the NCLT was challenged by one of the ex-directors
of IFIN before the National Company Law Appellate Tribunal, New Delhi (NCLAT), which
dismissed the appeal vide order dated 31.01.2019. Order dated 31.01.2019 passed by the NCLAT was
appealed before this Court. Vide order dated 04.06.2019, this Court dismissed the civil appeal filed
by the said ex-director. Thus, this Court upheld initiation of the proceedings by the Ministry of
Corporate Affairs under section 130 of the Companies Act, 2018.
2.7 The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) initiated an inspection of the IL&FS and IFIN under Section
45N of the RBI Act, 1934. Pursuant to the investigation/inspection, the RBI submitted an
investigation/inspection report dated 22.03.2019 to IFIN. IFIN thereafter issued a notice dated
13.05.2019 under Section 140(1) of the Act, 2013 inter alia on BSR seeking to remove them as
auditors. BSR filed a written response to the notice served by IFIN under Section 140(1) of the Act,
2013 denying the allegations in the notice. A hearing was held on 29.05.2019 by IFIN Criminal
Appeal Nos.2305-2307/2022 Etc.
where BSR was also represented/present.
2.8 Pursuant to the Office Order dated 30.09.2018, SFIO submitted the investigation report of
IL&FS Financial Services Limited (SFIO Report).
2.9 The Ministry of Corporate Affairs vide letter dated 29.05.2019 requested the Regional Director
(Western Region) and the SFIO to initiate proceedings/prosecution. The SFIO was asked to initiate
proceedings/prosecution under Section 447 and other provisions of the Companies Act, r/w
Sections 417, 420 and 120B of the Indian Penal Code. The Regional Director was asked to institute a
Petition under Section 140(5) of the Act, 2013.
2.10 That thereafter the SFIO filed a criminal complaint on 30.05.2019 before the Sessions Court
(Special Judge – Companies Act), Mumbai against, amongst others, the auditors/ex-auditors of
IFIN being CC No. 20/2019.
2.11 That thereafter the Ministry of Corporate Affairs filed a Petition under Section 140(5) of the Act,
2013 dated 10.06.2019, inter alia, against the auditors of the IFIN, namely, BSR & Deloitte and the

engagement partners as Criminal Appeal Nos.2305-2307/2022 Etc.
well as their team. In the petition under Section 140(5), it was inter alia prayed to remove BSR as
auditors of IFIN; declare that Deloitte shall be deemed to be removed as Statutory Auditor for
IL&FS for F.Y. 2012-13 to F.Y. 2017- 18; permit the Ministry of Corporate Affairs to appoint an
auditor for IFIN under the first proviso of Section 140(5) of the Act, 2013; and declare/direct that
BSR, its engagement partners, Deloitte and its engagement partners shall not be eligible to be
appointed as an auditor for any company for a period of five years under the second proviso of
Section 140(5) of the Act, 2013.
2.12 BSR issued a letter of resignation dated 19.06.2019 to IFIN and simultaneously completed the
regulatory filings pursuant to such resignation.
2.13 BSR and its engagement partners filed a reply dated 19.06.2019 to Section 140(5) petition
before the NCLT, inter alia, contending that (i) they are not the auditors for IFIN any longer as they
have tendered their resignation and therefore Section 140(5) is not applicable to them; and (ii)
Section 140(5) does not demonstrate any case for fraud against BSR.
Criminal Appeal Nos.2305-2307/2022 Etc.
2.14 Deloitte filed an application dated 19.06.2019 challenging the maintainability of Section 140(5)
petition before the NCLT on the ground that Deloitte is no longer the auditor for IFIN. BSR and its
engagement partners also filed an application challenging the maintainability of Section 140(5)
petition before the NCLT on the ground that BSR is no longer the auditor for IFIN.
2.15 After hearing the auditors (BSR & Deloitte) on the applications challenging the maintainability
of Section 140(5) petition, the NCLT passed an order upholding the maintainability of Section
140(5) petition. That thereafter, the BSR filed a writ petition before the High Court, inter alia,
challenging the vires of Section 140(5) of the Act, 2013; the directions issued and the order of the
NCLT upholding the maintainability of Section 140(5) petition.
2.16 By the impugned judgment and order, though the High Court has upheld the validity of Section
140(5) of the Act, 2013, the High Court has interpreted section 140(5) of the Act, 2013 and has set
aside the order passed by the NCLT upholding the maintainability of Section 140(5) petition and has
quashed Section 140(5) petition and has Criminal Appeal Nos.2305-2307/2022 Etc.
set aside/quashed the directions issued by the Ministry of Corporate Affairs and the SFIO and also
has quashed/set aside criminal proceedings instituted by the SFIO. Hence, the present appeals.
Submissions on behalf of the Union of India:
3. Shri Balbir Singh, learned Additional Solicitor General of India appearing on behalf of the Union
of India has vehemently submitted that in the impugned judgment and order the High Court has
misinterpreted Section 140(5) of the Act, 2013, though the High Court has upheld the
Union Of India vs Deloitte Haskins And Sells Llp on 3 May, 2023
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/136418404/
5
constitutionality of the said provision.
3.1 It is submitted that as regards the interpretation of Section 140(5) of the Act, 2013, the High
Court has explained the legislative intent as being to induce/effect a change of an auditor in a
company where there is a suspected fraud. It is submitted that thereafter the High Court has
erroneously proceeded to hold that the intention behind Section 140(5) of the Act, 2013 is only to
break the collusion between the auditor and the company. It is submitted that accordingly, the High
Court erroneously Criminal Appeal Nos.2305-2307/2022 Etc.
holds that if the unholy bond between the auditor and company is broken, either by removal or
resignation, then Section 140(5) of the Act, 2013 fulfils its purpose. It is submitted that according to
the High Court, Section 140(5) of the Act is only attracted when despite the petition by the Central
Government, an auditor sets up a defence and opposes the petition frivolously and thus invites a
final order as set forth in the second proviso to Section 140(5) of the Act, 2013. It is submitted that
on this basis, the High Court proceeded to hold that the petition filed by the Union of India under
Section 140(5) of the Act, 2013 has been satisfied by the subsequent resignation of the auditor and
therefore the petition under Section 140(5) of the Act, 2013 filed by the Union of India is no longer
maintainable. It is submitted that the High Court erroneously proceeded to quash Section 140(5)
petition and the order passed by the NCLT, Mumbai upholding its maintainability.
3.2 Now insofar as quashing and setting aside the criminal proceedings, it is submitted that the
respondents assailed Section 212(14) direction on two grounds. Firstly, on the ground that the
issuance of the direction to prosecute within 30 hours of receipt of the IFIN SFIO Criminal Appeal
Nos.2305-2307/2022 Etc.
Report demonstrates non-application of mind. Secondly, that the IFIN SFIO Report was an
incomplete report as investigation had not been completed and therefore Section 212(14) direction
was incompetent. It is submitted that insofar as the first ground is concerned, the High Court
erroneously holds that there is non-application of mind since it was improbable that a report of
about 750 pages and 32000 pages of annexures could have been considered in 30 hours. Further,
the High Court erroneously holds that the relevant facts and documents to demonstrate application
of mind have not been placed on record. It is submitted that while doing so, the High court also
holds that the existence of a valid sanction can be appreciated in a writ Court and need not wait trial.
3.3 As regards the IFIN SFIO Report, it is submitted that the High Court holds summarily and
without even going into the same and erroneously holds that the SFIO Report is incomplete and
lacking and therefore Section 212(14) direction is incorrect and/or invalid.
3.4 On interpretation of Section 140(5) of the Act, 2013, Shri Balbir Singh, learned ASG has taken us
to the legislative history and legislative intent of Section 140(5) of the Act, 2013. It is submitted that
Section 140 of the Criminal Appeal Nos.2305-2307/2022 Etc.
Act, 2013 is titled as “Removal, resignation of auditor and giving of special notice”. It appears in
Chapter X of the Act which is titled as “Audit and Auditors”. Section 140(1) of the Act, 2013 provides
Union Of India vs Deloitte Haskins And Sells Llp on 3 May, 2023
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/136418404/
6
for the procedure to remove an auditor by the company before the expiry of his term. Sections
140(2) and (3) of the Act deal with resignation of auditors and Section 140(4) of the Act deals with
giving of special notice at an AGM for appointment of an auditor other than the retiring auditor and
the process in that regard. It is submitted that if an auditor of a company is acting directly or
indirectly in a fraudulent manner or is abetting or colluding in fraud with the management of a
company, Section 140(5) of the Act, 2013 empowers either the Central Government or any person
concerned to approach the NCLT for recourse. Section 140(5) of the Act also enables the NCLT to
take action suo motu against an auditor who has acted in the aforesaid manner. It is submitted that
in addition, Section 140(5) of the Act, 2013 has also two provisos and two explanations. It is
submitted that therefore as per the first proviso to Section 140(5), on an application made by the
Central Government and if the Tribunal is satisfied that any change of the auditor is required, the
Tribunal shall within Criminal Appeal Nos.2305-2307/2022 Etc.
fifteen days of receipt of such application make an order that the said auditor shall not function as
an auditor and the Central government may appoint another auditor in his place. It is submitted
that second proviso to Section 140(5) of the Act provides that an auditor, whether individual or firm,
against whom final order has been passed by the Tribunal under section 140(5) shall not be eligible
to be appointed as an auditor of any company for a period of five years from the date of passing of
the order and the auditor shall also be liable for action under Section 447. It is submitted that
therefore merely because during the pendency of the proceedings under Section 140(5) of the Act
the auditor resigns, the proceedings under Section 140(5) do not come to an end. Still and after the
final order is passed, in that case, a further order as per second proviso to Section 140(5) can be
passed to render such a auditor ineligible to be appointed as an auditor of any company for a period
of five years from the date of passing of the order and even such auditor shall also be liable for the
action under section 447 of the Companies Act. It is submitted that therefore the High Court has
materially erred in observing and holding that once the auditor has resigned thereafter Criminal
Appeal Nos.2305-2307/2022 Etc.
the application under section 140(5) of the Act shall not be maintainable and/or is not required to
be proceeded further.
3.5 Thereafter, Shri Balbir Singh, learned ASG has taken us and referred to the legislative history of
Section 1`40(5) of the Act as under:
Legislative History of Section 140(5) of the Act, 2013 Around August 2004, the Government
initiated the process of review of the Companies Act, 1956 and drafting of a new Companies Bill to
replace the Companies Act, 1956. A concept paper was published on the website of the Ministry of
Corporate Affairs on which various comments were received. An expert committee was also
constituted by the Ministry of Corporate Affairs under the chairmanship of Dr. J.J. Irani, to make
recommendations on provisions of company law.
a. Companies Bill 2008 and the Companies Bill 2009 i. After considering the report of the J.J. Irani
Committee, the Ministry prepared the Companies Bill, 2008 and introduced the same before the
Lok Sabha on October 23, 2008. The 2008 Bill was referred to the Department related
Union Of India vs Deloitte Haskins And Sells Llp on 3 May, 2023
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/136418404/
7
Parliamentary Standing Committee (PSC) on Finance for their examination. However, the Lok
Sabha was dissolved before the PSC could present its report and therefore the 2008 Bill lapsed as
per Article 107(5) of the Constitution of India.
ii. Accordingly, the Companies Bill 2009 was introduced in the Lok Sabha on or about July 15, 2009.
The 2009 Bill too was referred to the PSC. In identifying the features of the 2009 Bill, the PSC
Report of August 2010 notes the salient features as being “the role, rights and duties of the auditors
have been defined so as to Criminal Appeal Nos.2305-2307/2022 Etc.
maintain integrity and independence of the audit process.” iii. In setting out the guiding principles
underlying the 2009 Bill, the PSC, in the Report, notes that, amongst other principles, the following
are the key principles underlying the 2009Bill:
“Need for sturdy systems, enhanced transparency and comprehensive disclosures based regime
emphasized; as companies grow, become bigger and globalise with the number and range of
stakeholders increasing by volumes, necessitating proper checks and balances. Self-regulation
through internal mechanism/procedures, to be underpinned on strong systems and procedures;
Central Government to step in only when mis- governance takes place.
In the light of recent experiences in corporate mis- governance, process of audit and functioning of
auditors to be made more independent and effective; stringent joint and individual liability
prescribed; setting up of oversight body to set standards and supervise quality of audit
recommended” iv. Further, the report notes that various suggestions were made by the PSC during
deliberations on the Bill which were incorporated by the Central Government. On a reading of these
suggestions, it is essential to note that independence of the auditors was a key point. v. Crucially, in
the Report, the PSC notes that the 2009 Bill incorporates suggestions of the JPC on the 1993
Banking and Securities Market Scam and the 2002 JPC on the Stock Market Scam. This means that
the 2009 Bill was a culmination of the growing corporate economy and past experiences of
corporate fiascos too. One of the suggestions were to provide for stricter accountability for auditors.
Moreover, at the foot of the same page, the PSC notes that the 2009Bill has made the regulatory
provisions and regime more stricter by inter alia providing for making Criminal Appeal
Nos.2305-2307/2022 Etc.
statutory auditors more accountable by providing for substantial civil and criminal liability for
auditors. vi. The Report clearly demonstrates that there was a long discussion on the role,
responsibility, duties and regulation of auditors and the regulatory and enforcement provisions.
Particularly, the Report records that various suggestions were received to make the provisions
pertaining to audit and auditors more stringent. Significantly, it was suggested that Clause 123(10)
of the 2009 Bill (which provides for removal of an auditor by the NCLT on finding that there is a
fraud and corresponds to Section 140(5) of the Act) should be made more stringent and should
contemplate that an auditor removed by the Tribunal should not be eligible to be appointed as an
auditor of any company for a period of 5 years. The relevant extracts are as follows:

“34.Suggestions have been received by the Committee that there is a need to make provisions
relating to Audit and Auditors more stringent such as following:-
(d) Suitable penalty may be provided in case of contravention of these provisions.
(e) (i) Clause 123(10) of the Bill empowers the Tribunal, if it is satisfied that the auditor of a
company has acted in a fraudulent manner or abetted/colluded in any fraud, to direct the company
to change its auditors. Suggestions have been made that these provisions should be modified to
clarify to cover act of fraud or abetment by auditor whether directly or indirectly. It has also been
suggested that the Bill may provide that if auditor, whether individual or firm, against whom an
order has been passed by the Tribunal under this clause should not be eligible to be appointed as an
auditor of any company for a period of five years.” b. The Companies Bill, 2011 i. In view of the
recommendations of the Standing Committee and that of various stakeholders, the Central
Government withdrew the 2009 Bill with a view to Criminal Appeal Nos.2305-2307/2022 Etc.
introduce a fresh Bill incorporating the recommendations of the Standing Committee and various
stakeholders. Consequently, the 2011 Bill was introduced in the Lok Sabha in December, 2011,
accepting and incorporating most of the recommendations made by the previous Standing
Committee in respect of the Companies Bill, 2009. This aspect has been recorded in the Statements
of Objects and Reasons of the Companies Bill, 2011.
ii. At this juncture, it is important to bear in mid that the suggestion of the Standing Committee to
Clause 123(10) of the 2009 Bill (which provides for removal of an auditor by the NCLT on finding
that there is a fraud) was to:
† Make the provision more stringent; and † To provide for consequences for an auditor when such
auditor is found to have been perpetrating a fraud and is removed by the NCLT for such fraud. iii.
The 2001 Bill consolidates the provisions pertaining to removal of auditors into one clause namely
Clause 140 of the 2011 Bill. Further, the 2011 Bill (like the 2009 Bill) retains the NCLT’s power to
remove an auditor upon finding that the auditor has perpetrated a fraud at Clause 140(5) of the 2011
Bill. Most pertinently, the 2011 Bill incorporating the recommendations of the Standing Committee
as contained in the Report, provides for consequences for an auditor who is found to have
perpetrated a fraud by the NCLT and is removed for such fraud by the NCLT. This has been done by
way of a proviso to Clause 140(5) of the Bill (particularly the second proviso). The relevant extract of
Section 140(5) of the 2011 Bill is as follows:
“(5) Without prejudice to any action under the provisions of this Act or any other law for the time
being in force, the Tribunal either suo motu or on an application made to it by the Central
Government or by any person concerned, if it is satisfied that the auditor of a company has, whether
directly or indirectly, acted in a fraudulent manner or abetted or Criminal Appeal
Nos.2305-2307/2022 Etc.
colluded in any fraud by, or in relation to, the company or its directors or officers, it may, by order,
direct the company to change its auditors:

Provided that if the application is made by the Central Government and the Tribunal is satisfied that
any change of the auditor is required, it shall within fifteen days of receipt of such application, make
an order that he shall not function as an auditor and the Central government may appoint another
auditor in his place:
Provided further that an auditor, whether individual or firm, against whom final order has been
passed by the Tribunal under this section shall not be eligible to be appointed as an auditor of any
company for a period of five years from the date of passing of the order and the auditor shall also be
liable for action under section 447.
Explanation – For the purposes of this Chapter the word “auditor” includes a firm of auditors”.
iv. Thereafter, in January 2012, the 2011 Bill was placed before the Standing Committee by the Lok
Sabha. The Standing Committee has prepared and finalized its report in this regard, and insofar as
the penalty and guiding principles of Clause 140(5) are concerned, there is no further guidance on
the legislative intent behind the same.
v. In view of the above, the test of Clause 140(5) of the 2011 Bill has remained unchanged, the same
has been enacted as the present Section 140(5) of the Companies Act, 2013.
3.6 It is submitted that therefore by way of Companies Bill, 2009 subsequently introduction the Act,
for the first time it includes an obligation to an auditor to report any Criminal Appeal
Nos.2305-2307/2022 Etc.
fraud detected to the Central Government as per Section 143(12) of the Act and incorporated in the
form of the second proviso to Section 140(5) of the Act a provision to make an auditor who has been
found to have been acting in a fraudulent manner or colluding from being an auditor in any
company for a period of 5 years. It is submitted that therefore, the public policy behind Section
140(5) of the Act is very clear – to prevent an auditor who has been found to perpetrate fraud or
colluding in it in one company from undertaking any statutory audits for a period of 5 years.
Reliance is placed on the decision of this Court in the case of Devas Multimedia Pvt. Ltd. v. Antrix
Corporation Ltd. & Anr, reported in (2023) 1 SCC 216.
3.7 It is further submitted by Shri Balbir Singh, learned ASG that Section 140(5) appears in Chapter
X of the Act. It is submitted that Chapter X specifically deals with ‘Audit and Auditors’. Section 143
of the Act deals with the powers and duties of the auditors. Sub-section (12) of Section 143
specifically provides that in the event that the auditors has reason to believe that an offence of fraud
is being or has been committed in the company, the auditor shall report the matter to the Central
Government. The Criminal Appeal Nos.2305-2307/2022 Etc.
detailed procedure is provided under the Rules issued in this regard.
3.8 It is further submitted that Section 144 of the Act provides that the auditor cannot provide
certain services and the relevant one for the present matter is “Management services”. It is
Union Of India vs Deloitte Haskins And Sells Llp on 3 May, 2023
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/136418404/
10
submitted that the objective is that the auditor should function as an independent person
uninfluenced by any of its activities outside the scope of audit services. The auditor is prohibited
from providing any management service to the Company. It is submitted that the prohibition and
restriction created under Section 144 of the Act is primarily to protect the interest of the Company in
question and other stakeholders such as lenders and investors and the public at large.
3.9 It is submitted that keeping these provisions and the underlying public policy in the backdrop,
Section 140 (5) of the Act, 2013 is to be considered. It is submitted that the plain words of Section
140(5) of the Act, 2013 provide for the NCLT to, either suo motu or on an application made by the
Central Government/any person concerned, inquire into/examine the conduct of an auditor or his
involvement in a fraud and reach a satisfaction as regards Criminal Appeal Nos.2305-2307/2022
Etc.
the auditors fraudulent conduct. The provision further prescribes that the satisfaction of the Hon’ble
NCLT “may” finally result in a change of an auditor.
3.10 It is submitted that the first proviso to Section 140(5) of the Act is contemplated as an interim
or pro-term measure to prevent an existing auditor from continuing and substitute him with an
auditor nominated by the Central Government based on a prima facie satisfaction that a fraud has
been perpetrated and when circumstances warrant the substitution. This is an interim order and
operates akin to a temporary suspension.
3.11 It is submitted that the second proviso to Section 140(5) of the Act which is in the nature of a
substantive provision activates on an order recording the Hon’ble NCLT’s satisfaction of fraudulent
or collusive conduct by an auditor and his consequent removal from the Company and debars him
from being an auditor in any company for a period of 5 years. An order under the first proviso is not
the order contemplated under the second proviso to Section 140(5) of the Act. Thus, if the NCLT
finally finds no grounds to hold that there has been fraudulent conduct or collusion in fraud, then
the auditor who may have been Criminal Appeal Nos.2305-2307/2022 Etc.
temporarily suspended under an order under the first proviso can be re-instated.
3.12 It is submitted that Section 140(5) of the Act therefore confers power onto the Hon’ble NCLT to
adjudicate on or inquire into the conduct of an auditor and determine whether the auditor has
conducted itself in a fraudulent manner. This is clear from the operative part of the provision which
mandates the nature of inquiry required under the section. This is “directly or indirectly, acted in a
fraudulent manner or abetted or colluded in any fraud by, or in relation to, the company or its
directors or officers.” 3.13 It is submitted that therefore, any final order would certainly contain
either a positive or negative determination of “fraud” or “fraudulent conduct”. As a consequence of
finding fraud under Section 140(5) of the Act, the provision illustrates that the finding of
fraud/fraudulent conduct “may” lead to an order directing change of an auditor. The second proviso
further expressly provides that an auditor “against whom a final order has been passed” is in-eligible
to act as an auditor of any company for a period of 5 years. Significantly, the words used in the
second proviso to Section 140(5) of the Criminal Appeal Nos.2305-2307/2022 Etc.
Union Of India vs Deloitte Haskins And Sells Llp on 3 May, 2023
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/136418404/
11
Act is “final order” and not “the auditor so removed” or “changed auditor”.
3.14 It is submitted that therefore the requirement or necessity of change of auditor in a company
does not activate/govern the power of the NCLT under Section 140(5) of the Act, 2013. Instead, it is
the inquiry into the fraudulent act by an auditor who abdicates his statutorily prescribed
independent role and responsibilities and colludes with the management or otherwise perpetrates a
fraud. It is submitted that the essence of the provision/section is determination of fraudulent
conduct of the auditor. The consequent “removal” contemplated by Section 140(5) of the Act, 2013 is
not just as acting as an auditor in one company or the company concerned but from any company
for a period of five years.
3.15 It is submitted that therefore the interpretation of Section 140(5) of the Act, 2013 made by the
High Court in the impugned judgment and order is just contrary to the object and purpose of
enactment of Section 140(5) of the Act, 2013 and, as such, is contrary to the said provision.
Criminal Appeal Nos.2305-2307/2022 Etc.
3.16 Shri Balbir Singh, learned ASG has submitted that during the course of arguments, the
submissions made on behalf of the respondents are as under:
a) Section 140(5) of the Act, in light of the other provisions of the Act, is only to
incentivize a recalcitrant auditor into resigning. Therefore, if an auditor resigns after
the filing of a Petition under Section 140(5) of the Act but before the Hon’ble NCLT
pronounces an order on that Petition, the purpose behind Section 140(5) of the Act is
fulfilled. This interpretation of Section 140(5) of the Act is, as per the Respondent’s
case, clear from the plain words of the provision;
b) continuing a proceeding against an auditor under Section 140(5) of the Act would
despite his resignation would lead to reading in a proviso into Section 140(5) of the
Act which deems his continuance till the culmination of proceedings under Section
140(5) of the Act;
c) The second proviso to Section 140(5) of the Act is arbitrary, harsh and burdensome
and ought to be read down. The mandatory ineligibility to act as an auditor for a
period of 5 years ought to be read as for a period up to 5 years to make the provision
constitutional.
d) The ineligibility to act as an auditor of any company prescribed under the second
proviso to Section 140(5) of the Act can only extend to the audit partners concerned
and not to the entire firm and the other audit partners who were not connected with
the fraudulent act or acts.
Criminal Appeal Nos.2305-2307/2022 Etc.
Union Of India vs Deloitte Haskins And Sells Llp on 3 May, 2023
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/136418404/
12
3.17 Meeting with the aforesaid submissions, it is submitted as under:
a) Acceptance of Respondent’s contention would mean that the jurisdiction of a
quasi-judicial tribunal can be overcome merely by an act of a party. More
significantly, it would lead mean that an inquiry into fraudulent conduct can be
disrupted and/or stands satisfied simply by an act of a party.
b) The entire contention of the provision operating in terrorem or to incentivize an
auditor to resign is untenable. The consequences of indulging in fraudulent activities
provided for in the Act including but not limited to Section 447 of the Act itself ought
to serve as a deterrent and operate “in terrorem”.
c) The entire construction sought to be attributed to Section 140(5) of the Act by
reference to the other provisions of the Act (as per paragraphs 9.17 (a) and (b) above)
is to turn the provision into a dead letter [See NEPC Micon Ltd. v. Magma Leasing
Limited (1999) 4 SCC 253]. Moreover, the Respondent’s interpretation, if accepted,
would lead to various absurdities. Pertinently, amongst other reasons:
i. given that it is accepted that the first proviso provides for a temporary suspension or removal of an
auditor, if an application is filed under the first proviso and the errant auditor replaced (albeit
temporarily), then an order Second Proviso can never follow. This is because the errant auditor
cannot, as on date of the Criminal Appeal Nos.2305-2307/2022 Etc.
final order, be said to be the auditor of a company due to the first proviso order.
ii. there exists no reason for Section 140(5) of the Act to operate in terrorrem or to induce a
recalcitrant auditor to resign. This is so since the first proviso to Section 140(5) of the Act operates
immediately to effect a change of the auditor/remove the existing auditor after filing of a Petition by
the Central Government under Section 140(5) of the Act. In other words, the first proviso would
thus be rendered redundant if the intention behind Section 140(5) of the Act is to induce an auditor
into resigning.
d) The ineligibility to act as an auditor for any company for a period of 5 years cannot be read down
to mean “for a period “up to five years”. This is so since:
i. apprehension or misuse of the provision in future cannot be ground to test the constitutional
validity of the provision. [See Madras Bar Association v. Union of India 2021 SCC Online SC 463
(para 101-102)] ii. fraud vitiates everything and the punishment mandates in the statute cannot be
varied by examining the length and breadth of the fraud.
iii. the ineligibility to act under Section 140(5) of the Act is only for acting as an auditor of any
company. It does not stop the auditor concerned from practising as a chartered accountant
generally. The individual or firm concerned can take up any other activity pertaining to Criminal
Appeal Nos.2305-2307/2022 Etc.
Union Of India vs Deloitte Haskins And Sells Llp on 3 May, 2023

13
accounts of the company (which is otherwise barred for an auditor by virtue of Section 144) such as
account and book keeping service, actuarial service etc or otherwise. In fact, in the present case, the
auditing firms involved have a very significant part of their business outside the audit function. The
prohibition of 5 years does not affect their practise as a chartered accountant or any other area of
service; and iv. the fixed prohibition period of 5 years activates only in the event of finding of a fraud
by the Hon’ble NCLT in terms of the statutory scheme and public policy. The principle of
proportionality cannot be raised to a level where the extent of the fraud is required to be examined.
The very deterrent effect of the provision would get diluted and more importantly, it would amount
to perpetuating the fraud in connection with other companies.
v. As regards the extent of application of the ineligibility prescribed under the second proviso to
Section 140(5) of the Act to the firm and individuals, it is submitted that a close reading of the
provisions of the Act reflects that the legislature considered every aspect relating to the consequence
of Section 140(5) of the Act. An examination of the second proviso to Section 140(5) of the act shows
that the Hon’ble NCLT is required to give specific findings with regard to fraud and whether the
auditor is a firm or an individual. There cannot be any presumption that mere finding of fraud in
connection with an individual will automatically result in the determination of fraud by the firm.
This is also provided under Section 147 of the Act which is as follows:
Criminal Appeal Nos.2305-2307/2022 Etc.
(5) Where, in case of audit of a company being conducted by an audit firm, it is proved that the
partner or partners of the audit firm has or have acted in a fraudulent manner or abetted or colluded
in any fraud by, or in relation to or by, the company or its directors or officers, the liability, whether
civil or criminal as provided in this Act or in any other law for the time being in force, for such act
shall be of the partner or partners concerned of the audit firm and of the firm jointly and severally.
Provided that in case of criminal liability of an audit firm, in respect of liability other than fine, the
concerned partner or partners, who acted in a fraudulent manner or abetted or, as the case may be,
colluded in any fraud shall only be liable.
3.18 Now so far as the submission on behalf of the respondents that once an auditor resigns, the
provisions of Section 140(5) of the Act would cease to apply. Instead, the auditor concerned can be
proceeded against under Section 241(3) of the Act and the proceedings pursuant to Section 241(3) of
the Act would lead to the same result and the auditor would be held not to be ‘fit and proper person’
to be appointed in any other office connected with the conduct and management of any company. It
is submitted that:
Criminal Appeal Nos.2305-2307/2022 Etc.
a. Section 241(3) and its consequential provisions were introduced with effect from 14.8.2019, which
authorized the Central Government to apply to the Tribunal with a request to declare that the
persons mentioned in Section 241(3) of the Act are ‘not fit and proper persons to hold the office of
director or any other office connected with conduct and management of any company”.
Union Of India vs Deloitte Haskins And Sells Llp on 3 May, 2023
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/136418404/
14
b. Constructing “any other office connected with the conduct and management of any company”, it
would be necessary to consider the consequential provisions that were enacted along with Section
241(3) of the Act. Particularly, Section 243(1A) and Section 243(2) of the Act.
(1A) The person who is not a fit and proper person pursuant to sub-section (4A) of section 242 shall
not hold the office of a director or any other office connected with the conduct and management of
the affairs of any company for a period of five years from the date of the said decision (2) Any person
who knowingly acts as a managing director or other director or manager of a company in
contravention of clause (b) of sub-section (1) or sub-section (1A), and every other director of the
company who is knowingly a party to such contravention, shall be punishable with fine which may
extend to five lakh rupees Criminal Appeal Nos.2305-2307/2022 Etc.
Clearly, from the words of the consequential provision, it is clear that the reference in specifically
Section 241(3) of the Act to “any other office connected with the conduct and management of any
company” means those akin to manager, managing director or other director such as key managerial
personnel and not an auditor.
c. Moreover, in Section 241(3) of the Act specifically, the words used are “conduct and management
of the company”. The auditor as the Act sets forth is an independent examiner of accounts and
cannot be said to be holding an office in the conduct and management of the company. This would
militate against the very fibre of the Companies Act, 2013.
3.19 Making above submissions, it is submitted that, (i) Section 140(5) of the Act, 2013 operates to
enable a quasi-judicial tribunal equipped with powers of a civil court to examine the role of auditors
and adjudicate on their fraudulent conduct and the abdication of their function;
(ii)Section 140(5) is not a provision to merely induce/effect a change of an auditor who is not
resigning. It is intended as a provision which involves a substantive determination of fraud so as to
isolate or remove an auditor from the company and from any company that he/she is auditing. If
construed to be a provision only to induce a change of a recalcitrant auditor, the words Criminal
Appeal Nos.2305-2307/2022 Etc.
conferring power on the NCLT to inquire into an auditor’s fraudulent conduct would be rendered
meaningless; (iii) the second proviso to Section 140(5) of the Act is essentially remedial and
preventive, though it might incidentally also have a punitive effect. The public purpose / object of
the second proviso to Section is clearly to protect companies from being prejudicially affected, by
debarring such an auditor, who has been held to have acted fraudulently, from being appointed as
an auditor of any company.
3.20 It is submitted that in the facts of the present case, it is pertinent to note that:
a) Deloitte was the statutory auditor of IFIN from 2008 till 2018. Deloitte retired by
efflux of time in 2018;
Union Of India vs Deloitte Haskins And Sells Llp on 3 May, 2023
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/136418404/
15
b) BSR was appointed as the joint statutory auditor in 2017;
c) both Deloitte and BSR jointly conducted the statutory audit of IFIN for the
Financial Year 2017-2018;
d) the Petitioner i.e., the Union of India filed the Petition under Section 140(5) of the
Act against both BSR and Deloitte on June 1, 2019. BSR was the statutory auditor at
that time.
e) this Petition is based on the SFIO IFIN Report which alleges that both auditors i.e.,
Deloitte and BSR acted in a fraudulent manner. This includes the period when
Deloitte was the sole auditor and for the year when the audit was jointly performed
by BSR;
f)after the Petition was filed, BSR tendered its resignation Criminal Appeal Nos.2305-2307/2022
Etc.
and filed an application in or about July 2019 challenging the maintainability of the Union of India’s
Petition under Section 140(5) of the Act. Deloitte who had retired in 2018 also filed maintainability
application; and
g) after leave from the Hon’ble Supreme Court, the Union of India invoked the Hon’ble NCLT’s
powers under the first proviso to Section 140(5) of the Act and an auditor was appointed for IFIN.
3.21 It is submitted that therefore in the facts and circumstances of the present case and on true
interpretation of Section 140(5) of the Act, explained above, the High Court has erroneously
quashed the NCLT’s order upholding the maintainability of Union of India’s petition under Section
140(5) of the Act, 2013 and the proceedings under Section 140(5) of the Act, 2013 against the
auditors – BSR.
3.22 Given the interpretation of Section 140(5) of the Act submitted above, it is contended that the
act of resignation of BSR after the filing of the Petition under Section 140(5) of the Act cannot be
held to render the proceedings under Section 140(5) of the Act as void. The Hon’ble Bombay High
Court’s interpretation would render any proceedings whether against the company’s management
and / or its auditors for fraud completely frustrated by mere stratagem of design of a party. Under
Criminal Appeal Nos.2305-2307/2022 Etc.
the circumstances, the Impugned Order passed by the Hon’ble Bombay High Court is unsustainable
and deserves to be set aside.
3.23 As regards, Deloitte, it is submitted that the Hon’ble NCLT and the NCLAT have upheld the
maintainability of the Petition under Section 140(5) of the Act. It is submitted that as set out above,
Section 140(5) of the Act requires the Hon’ble NCLT to satisfy itself that the auditor of the company,
whether directly or indirectly, acted in a fraudulent manner or abetted or colluded in any fraud. In
Union Of India vs Deloitte Haskins And Sells Llp on 3 May, 2023
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/136418404/
16
order to arrive at a finding in this regard, it is important to examine the role of both auditors i.e.,
Deloitte and BSR especially when both were acting as auditors for the financial year 2017- 2018.
Keeping in mind the interpretation of the provision set out above, the satisfaction of the Tribunal
may finally result in a change of auditor i.e., the change of BSR; however, that does not take away
the powers given to the Hon’ble NCLT in terms of Section 140(5) of the Act to inquire into the fraud
qua Deloitte as well and if found record a satisfaction of fraud against Deloitte in its final order.
Therefore, in the facts of this case, the final order and therefore the second proviso can operate
against Deloitte and BSR.
Criminal Appeal Nos.2305-2307/2022 Etc.
3.24 Now so far as quashing and setting aside Section 212(14) direction by the Ministry of Corporate
Affairs and the Criminal Complaint filed by the SFIO and the IFIN SFIO Report, it is submitted that
the Bombay High Court has, in the Impugned Order, set aside/quashed the 212(14) Direction and
the Criminal Complaint and the SFIO IFIN Report on the ground that:
a. SFIO IFIN Report is an incomplete report/report on an incomplete investigation and therefore
the 212(14) Direction could not be given. The alleged basis of this finding is: (i) a singular paragraph
in the SFIO IFIN Report; and (ii) the 212(14) Direction which calls for a further report on certain
aspects itself demonstrates that the investigation is incomplete; and b. The 212(14) Direction was
given within 30 hours of placing the SFIO IFIN Report before the Central Government and it was
improbable for the Central Government to have applied its mind within such a short period.
It is submitted that the impugned order is incorrect since:
a. The SFIO IFIN Report is a report prepared by the SFIO on the completion of investigation into
IFIN viz. one of the companies under investigation. The Hon’ble Bombay High Court has not
appreciated the position that: i. By an order dated September 30, 2018, an investigation was
directed to be conducted by the SFIO Criminal Appeal Nos.2305-2307/2022 Etc.
into IL&FS and its subsidiaries (IL&FS Group) which aggregates to approx. 100-169 entities; ii. The
conduct of affairs of the IL&FS Group which was set out in the Interim Report of the SFIO dated
November 30, 2018 clearly set forth that there were a number of interlinkages within the group,
routing transactions etc;
iii. IFIN is one of the subsidiaries in the IL&FS Group and the financial services arm. It facilitated
borrowings for different group companies in the IL&FS Group from third party borrowers and at
times routed funding from one group company to another; iv. Given the nature of interlinkages and
overlaps between different entities in the IL&FS Group, the SFIO IFIN Report sets out that the SFIO
IFIN Report is a report in respect of IFIN and is a report upon completion of investigation into
IFIN; and v. Finally, the SFIO IFIN Report sets forth, in light of the complex structure of the IL&FS
Group and the interlinkages between entities etc, that if any further instances or transactions are
uncovered qua IFIN during the investigation of the other group companies of IL&FS then a further
report will be filed.
Union Of India vs Deloitte Haskins And Sells Llp on 3 May, 2023
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/136418404/
17
This does not mean that the investigation into IFIN is incomplete. In fact, even the direction to call
for a further report on certain aspects (which may be related to third parties) does not detract from
the position that the investigation is complete in all other respects. The Hon’ble Bombay High Court
has failed to appreciate the purport of the submission and has fundamentally erred in holding that
the SFIO IFIN Report is incomplete and/or that the investigation into IFIN is incomplete. In the
case at hand, the SFIO Criminal Appeal Nos.2305-2307/2022 Etc.
IFIN Report was submitted by the SFIO after a detailed and extensive investigation of IFIN and the
multiple parties involved. It is submitted that there were conclusive findings against each
auditor/CA pointing out multiple breaches, violations of statutory duties and fraudulent conduct
with respect to inter alia functioning of auditors at the relevant point of time.
b. The Bombay High Court has proceeded to accept the surface level argument of the respondents
that the 212(14) direction was issued within 30 hours which demonstrates non-application of mine
without considering the following:
i. The 212(14) direction itself demonstrates application of mind from the fact that the direction
requests the SFIO to prosecute additional persons whose involvement was discernible from a
reading of the SFIO IFIN Report. This would have been possible only if the SFIO IFIN Report had
been considered. In fact, the 212(14) Direction also rectifies a typographical error by the SFIO in the
charging section applied in the SFIO IFIN Report;
ii. The affidavit in reply of the UOI before the Hon’ble High Court provided an
explanation/justification for the time taken to process and also set out the process leading up to the
212(14) Direction. As against the Respondent’s surface level allegation, the Union of India provided
a clear, transparent and cogent response; iii. The Respondents’ contentions were self-serving and
contradictory. Particularly, the contention that the Union of India did not apply its mind given the
period of 30 hours taken to issue the 212(14) Direction is directly contrary to the contention that the
direction (contained in the 212(14) Direction) to call for a further report demonstrates that
investigation is incomplete. Notwithstanding the fact that Criminal Appeal Nos.2305-2307/2022
Etc.
investigation into IFIN is complete, a direction for a further report on certain aspects could only
have been issued after application of mind.
iv. Legal and factual mala fides has a very high threshold – one that cannot be met with a surface
level contention of speed of processing.
v. The scope of intervention before a Hon’ble Court with Writ Jurisdiction would be to determine if
there was sufficiency of material before the authority granting the direction. In the present case, the
SFIO IFIN Report was before the authority granting the direction to prosecute – this fact is not
disputed. Therefore, it cannot be said that the relevant materials were not present before the
relevant authority.

3.25 Now so far as the submission on behalf of the respondents that before the NCLT the SFIO IFIN
Report was referred to as second interim report and therefore the SFIO IFIN Report being an
interim report, 212(14) direction could not have been issued as the Act does not contemplate
issuance of a direction under Section 212(14) of the Act on the basis of an interim report, it is
submitted by Shri Balbir Singh, learned ASG that as per section 212(11) of the Act, 2013, during the
Criminal Appeal Nos.2305-2307/2022 Etc.
course of investigation, the Central Government has been empowered to call for an interim report. It
is submitted that the SFIO has not been empowered to submit an interim report without a request
for an interim report from the Central Government. It is submitted that the Central Government
vide letter dated 03.11.2018 specifically directed the SFIO to submit an interim report. Pursuant to
this, the SFIO submitted an interim report dated 30.11.2018. The Interim Report, on a bare perusal,
records that it is an interim report, records the Central Government’s request for an interim report
and classifies its findings as interim findings. It is submitted that this is completely different from
the SFIO IFIN Report which classifies itself as an Investigation Report under Section 212(12) of the
Act, sets out the detailed and extensive investigation conducted and records conclusive findings
against each of the Respondents in the present case. It is submitted that therefore, the stray
references to the SFIO IFIN Report as an interim report cannot be accepted to classify the report as
an Interim Report. It is submitted that in fact, the only reason for such reference was since the
Criminal Appeal Nos.2305-2307/2022 Etc.
investigation into the affairs of other subsidiaries in the IL&FS Group (apart from IFIN) is on-going.
It is submitted that in fact the said position has been appreciated by the Bombay High Court in the
impugned order in paragraph numbers 202(VIII) and 202(XII).
3.26 Thereafter, Shri Balbir Singh, learned ASG has taken us to the findings recorded in the SFIO
IFIN Report. It is submitted that based on the findings in the Investigation Report, auditors have
been charged with:
a. fraud under Section 447 of the Act for colluding with the management of IFIN and
falsifying the books of accounts;
b. failure in discharging duties under section 143 & 147 of the Act ; and c. suppression
of information/ facts to hide the true and fair account of the financial statements and
present a rosy picture under section 211 read with section 628 & Section 129 read
with section 448 of the Act.
It is submitted that the Investigation Report broadly records that the auditors despite knowledge did
not point out any financial abnormality in the operation of IFIN and gave an unmodified opinion
stating that the financial statements give a true and fair view in conformity with the Criminal Appeal
Nos.2305-2307/2022 Etc.
accounting standards and other accounting principles accepted in India.

3.27 It is submitted that in the Investigation Report, there are specific findings with respect to
auditing of borrowings and utilisation; audit of non-convertible debentures; audit of lendings. It is
submitted that on the basis of the findings recorded in the Investigation Report, the auditors have
been charged under Section 447 of the Companies Act, 2013 and Sections 417, 420 r/w 120B of the
IPC. It is submitted that therefore the High Court has materially erred in quashing and setting aside
the direction issued under Section 212(14) of the Act and the complaint/prosecution launched
against the auditors. 3.28 Making above submissions, it is prayed to set aside the judgment and
order passed by the High Court by which the High Court has quashed Section 212(14) direction and
the complaint filed by the SFIO and permit the trial to continue against the accused arrayed in the
complaint. It is also prayed to set aside the impugned judgment and order passed by the High Court
quashing and setting aside the order passed by the NCLT/NCLAT upholding the proceedings under
Section 140(5) of the Act, 2013 and permit/allow the said proceedings to be Criminal Appeal
Nos.2305-2307/2022 Etc.
proceeded further, so as to allow the NCLT to reach to the final conclusion so that even further steps
can be taken as per second proviso to Section 140(5) of the Act, 2013.
Submissions on behalf of the opposite parties:
4. While opposing the present appeals, learned senior counsel appearing on behalf of the BSR has
made the following submissions:
i) It is submitted that in fact the BSR had challenged the vires of Section 140(5) of the
Act, 2013 before the High Court being violative of Articles 14, 19(1)(g), 20 and 21 of
the Constitution of India as well as being unconstitutional and void. It is submitted
that however the High Court by the impugned judgment and order while upholding
the constitutionality of Section 140(5) has read down Section 140(5) of the Act, 2013.
ii) It is submitted that by the impugned judgment and order, the High Court has held that the object
of Section 140(5) is to remove an auditor who has neither been removed by the company, nor
resigned. It is further observed that the role of the NCLT under Section 140(5) is only to examine the
need to change a Criminal Appeal Nos.2305-2307/2022 Etc.
company’s auditor and not to punish or debar the auditor. It is submitted that rejecting the
Ministry’s submission that the NCLT can pass an order to debar an auditor for 5 years under section
140(5) of the Act, the High Court has held that the NCLT’s order under section 140(5) can only be
for change of auditor of the company. It is further observed and held that the consequences of
debarment in the second proviso automatically follow upon such change and NCLT does not have
any discretion in it.
iii) It is submitted that before the High Court, the BSR also challenged two orders of the NCLT,
namely, order dated 09.08.2019 and order dated 18.10.2019. Both these orders were passed by the
NCLT purportedly under section 140(5) of the Act in proceedings commenced pursuant to the
Ministry’s sanction and directions dated 29.05.2019 under section 212 of the Act. It is submitted
Union Of India vs Deloitte Haskins And Sells Llp on 3 May, 2023
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/136418404/
20
that BSR had also challenged the jurisdiction of NCLT to pass orders under section 140(5) of the
Act, 2013. It is submitted that the NCLT has not determined the merits of a section 140(5) order and
the NCLT in its first order has only upheld the maintainability of section 140(5) proceedings. It is
Criminal Appeal Nos.2305-2307/2022 Etc.
submitted that therefore the submissions on behalf of the respondents do not go into the merits at
all.
iv) Now so far as on interpretation and applicability of section 140(5) of the Act, 2013, learned
counsel appearing on behalf of the respective respondents – original writ petitioners has taken us to
the scheme of regulation of Auditors under the Companies Act and has taken us to the various
provisions relating to the regulation of Auditors under the Companies Act, more particularly
Sections 132, 141, 147, 245, 447 and Sections 435 to 438 of the Companies Act. It is submitted that
the Act provides a holistic scheme for regulation and punishment of Auditors, all of which have been
different functions and purpose and with such matrix of sections, no auditor can get away with
fraud, abetment of fraud, professional misconduct etc. It is submitted that therefore no auditor can
escape by way of resignation or termination of tenure due to efflux of time.
v) It is submitted that a plain reading of Section 140 as a whole shows:
Criminal Appeal Nos.2305-2307/2022 Etc.
i. Section 140(1) of the Act deals with the procedure for voluntary auditor by a company.
ii. 140(2) and (3) deal with the procedure for resignation of an auditor.
iii. Section 140(4) deals with special notice.
Section 140(5) deals with involuntary removal by order of NCLT.
iv. The heading of Section 140 of the Act (i.e., "Removal, resignation of auditor and giving of special
notice") makes it clear that Section 140(5) only serves the purpose of removal of an auditor and is
not a standalone substantive provision to disqualify auditors. It is well settled that a heading is a
condensed name to collectively indicate the characteristics of the subject matter covered by a
Section. Reliance is placed on the decision of this Court in the case of Raichurmatham Prabhakar v.
Rawatmal Dugar, (2004) 4 SCC 766 (Para14).
vi) It is submitted that Sections 132, 141, 147, 245, and 447 of the Act deal with liability of an auditor
in cases of fraud:
i. Section 132 provides for the constitution of the National Financial Reporting Authority Criminal
Appeal Nos.2305-2307/2022 Etc.

("NFRA"). NFRA has been given ample power (including the powers of civil court) under Section
132 to impose penalty or punishment on an auditor (including debarring the auditor) to the auditors
professional or other misconduct. The explanation under Section 132 provides for the terms
"professional or other misconduct" to have the same meaning as prescribed under the Chartered
Accountants Act, 1949 ("CA Act"). The meaning of "professional or other misconduct" entails a very
wide scope as evinced from Schedule I and II of the CA Act. Therefore, if auditors are guilty of fraud
or abetting in fraud, they are certainly guilty of professional misconduct, for which powers are
vested with the NFRA to disqualify, suspend etc. ii. Section 141(3)(h), which specifically deals with
eligibility of auditors, provides for the ineligibility for appointment of an auditor in case such person
is convicted of an offence involving fraud. Section 141(3)(h) disqualifies the auditor for 10 years
from the date of conviction for an offence involving fraud. Pertinently, while the underlying offence
is the same, i.e., an act involving the same fraud, the penalty under Sections 140(5) and 141(3)(h)
are triggered at different times. A situation could arise where a person deemed ineligible under
Section 140(5) by way of the NCLT's final order is Criminal Appeal Nos.2305-2307/2022 Etc.
subsequently acquitted of the charge of fraud on the same set of facts under Section 447 of the Act
by the criminal court. Further even where a person is convicted under Section 447, if he has already
suffered the disqualification under Section 140(5) for 5 years he could face a further ineligibility to
be appointed as an auditor for 10 years.
The total period hence could extend to 15 years.
iii. Section 147(3) imposes financial liability on auditors by way of refund of remuneration or even
damages where the auditor is convicted under Section 147(2) of the Act. Section 147(5) further
imposes joint and several liability on audit firms and partners in case of criminal liability.
iv. Section 241(3)(a) pertains to the civil consequence of fraud and concern "any person concerned
in the conduct and management of the affairs of a company".
This would certainly include auditors who can be said to be concerned in the conduct and
management of a company's affairs. In a proceeding under Section 241, the NCLT will determine: (i)
whether there has been fraud; (ii) who the fraudsters are; (iii) who connived in or abetted the fraud;
and (iv) whether the parties are fit and proper persons. The NCLT can decide that an auditor has
connived in fraud and is not a fit Criminal Appeal Nos.2305-2307/2022 Etc.
and proper person under Section 242 (4A) which provides as follows:
"242. Powers of Tribunal. - (1) If, on any application made under section 241, the Tribunal is of the
opinion-...
(44) At the conclusion of the hearing of the case in respect of sub-section (3) of section 241, the
Tribunal shall record its decision stating therein specifically as to whether or not the respondent is a
fit and proper person to hold the office of director or any other office connected with the conduct
and management of any company."
Union Of India vs Deloitte Haskins And Sells Llp on 3 May, 2023
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/136418404/
22
v. The consequence of holding that a person is not fit and proper is provided in Section 243 (1A) viz.:
"243. Consequences of termination or modification of certain agreements – (1A) The person who is
not a fit and proper person pursuant to sub-section (4A) of section 242 shall not hold the office of a
director or any other office connected with the conduct and management of the affairs of any
company for a period of five years from the date of the said decision: Provided that the Central
Government may, with the leave of the Tribunal, permit such person to hold any such office before
the expiry of the said period of five years...."
Criminal Appeal Nos.2305-2307/2022 Etc.
If a person is found not to be a fit and proper person, under Section 243 (1A), the NCLT can order
that such person "shall not hold any office connected with the conduct or management of any
company for 5 years.
vi. Section 245(1)(g)(ii) also provides for damages or compensation to be ordered against auditors,
including an audit firm, by way of a class action suit for "Improper or misleading statement of
particulars made in his audit report or for any fraudulent, unlawful or wrongful act or conduct.
Section 245(2) permits the NCLT to impose "any suitable action"
vii. Section 447 pertains to the criminal consequences of fraud. Section 447 prescribes a punishment
for the offence of 'fraud, the offence itself is created by way of an explanation appended to the said
section. Section 447 of the Act provides: "447, Without prejudice to any liability including
repayment of any debt under this Act or any other law for the time being in force, any person who is
found to be guilty of fraud, shall be punishable with imprisonment for a term which shall not be less
than six months but which may extend to ten years and shall also be liable to fine which shall not be
less than the amount involved in the fraud, but which may extend Criminal Appeal
Nos.2305-2307/2022 Etc.
to three times the amount involved in the fraud:
Provided that where the fraud in question involves public interest, the term of imprisonment shall
not be less than three years.
Explanation. For the purposes of this section-
(i) "fraud" in relation to affairs of a company or any body corporate, includes any act, omission,
concealment of any fact or abuse of position committed by any person or any other person with the
connivance in any manner, with intent to deceive, to gain undue advantage from, or to injure the
interest of the company or its shareholders or its creditors or any other person, whether or not there
is any wrongful gain or wrongful loss:
(ii) "wrongful gain" means the gain by unlawful means of property to which the person gaining is
not legally entitled,

23
(iii) "wrongful loss" means the loss by unlawful means of property to which the person losing is
legally entitled"
vii) It is submitted that Sections 435 to 438 of the Companies Act provide a procedure in trial by a
Special Court incorporating safeguards of the CrPC. A chart Criminal Appeal Nos.2305-2307/2022
Etc.
reflecting the comparative scheme of protections afforded to parties before the NCLT as opposed to
a prosecution before the Special Court established under the Act
viii) It is submitted that even if Section 140(5) is not applicable in a given case due to the retirement
or resignation of an auditor prior to an order being passed, that will not enable such an auditor to
escape the vigour of law under the Companies Act, 2013, Even if an auditor resigns, he will
nevertheless have to face (a) prosecution for fraud under Section 447 of the Act; (b) action before
the National Financial Regulatory Authority; (c) order by the NCLT debarring auditors from acting
as such in respect of any company as well can be passed under Section 243 (1A) read with Section
241 and 242(4A); and (d) disqualification under Section 141(3)(h) if the auditor is found guilty of
fraud. The consequence of each of these proceedings is grave for the auditor, including debarment,
and the auditor does not escape punishment.
ix) It is submitted that the operative part of Section 140(5) empowers NCLT to direct a company to
“change” its auditor. NCLT can exercise this power if it Criminal Appeal Nos.2305-2307/2022 Etc.
is satisfied that ah auditor is guilty of acting in a fraudulent manner or in abetting or colluding in a
fraud and has neither resigned nor been removed by the company. It is submitted that therefore the
order that NCLT can pass under the operative part of Section 140(5) is against the company and not
the auditor. It is an order to the company to change its auditor and no other order. It is submitted
that the word “change” has been held to mean “replace with or exchange for another” and “the
substitution of one thing for another”.
x) It is submitted that as per the non-obstante clause provided in Section 140(5), it is clear that the
NCLT can direct the company and no one else to remove the auditor. The non-obstante clause needs
to be read with the term “change” as provided therein. It is submitted that Section 140(5) of the Act
cannot apply in circumstances where the auditor sought to be removed has ceased to hold that
position as no order of change can be passed once the auditor has resigned. It is submitted that this
is clear from the plain language of the provision itself.
xi) It is next submitted that under the first proviso to Section 140(5), when an application under
Section Criminal Appeal Nos.2305-2307/2022 Etc.
140(5) is filed by the Central Government and if NCLT is satisfied that a change in auditor is
required, then within 15 days from the date of filing the said application, NCLT can pass an urgent
order that the auditor will not “function” as an auditor and that the Central Government may
appoint a new auditor to replace the current auditor. It is submitted that this is in the nature of a pro
Union Of India vs Deloitte Haskins And Sells Llp on 3 May, 2023
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/136418404/
24
tem order pending final order by NCLT under the operative part of Section 140(5) and to facilitate
the Central Government in appointing an auditor whilst the existing auditor functioning is
restrained.
xii) It is next submitted that the second proviso to sub- section 5 of Section 140 contemplates that if
a final order is passed against the auditor, then the auditor will not be eligible to be appointed as an
auditor of any company for a period of five years from the date of passing of the order. Additionally,
the auditor shall also be liable for action under Section 447 of the Companies Act. It is submitted
that the second proviso does not contemplate any separate order by NCLT. Instead, it only provides
for an automatic consequence, i.e., five years ineligibility qua an auditor whether individual or
Criminal Appeal Nos.2305-2307/2022 Etc.
firm against whom a final order has been passed by the NCLT. It is submitted that moreover, the
entire firm gets automatically disqualified for the actions of even one of its partners. There is no
discretion provided to NCLT to alter the period of ineligibility. It is submitted that the debarment
prescribed under the second proviso is an in terrorem provision imposed by operation of law, in the
event an auditor chooses not to resign and forces upon himself a final order under the provision. It
is submitted that the plain language of second proviso is anchored squarely on a final order being
passed under the operative part of Section 140(5).
xiii)It is submitted that it is settled law that proceedings which may result in disqualification would
be of a quasi- criminal nature and have to be strictly construed. Since Section 140(5) results in a
disqualification of an auditor, proceedings thereunder would be quasi-criminal in nature.
Disqualification of a professional is akin to a death penalty. The standard of proof is therefore
satisfaction beyond reasonable doubt. Reliance is placed upon the decision of this Court in the case
of An Advocate v. Bar Council of India (1989) Supp 2 SCC Criminal Appeal Nos.2305-2307/2022
Etc.
25 (Para 4(1) & (11) and ICAI v. LK Ratna & Ors. (1986) 4 SCC 537 (para 18).
xiv)It is submitted that the Act needs to be read and interpreted in a holistic manner. Under the
scheme of the Act, it is Section 447 which specifically provides for punishment for fraud. Section
140(5) is not a provision to punish or penalize an auditor. By treating Section 140(5) instead of
Section 447 as a provision to punish for fraud, Ministry and NCLT failed to follow the well settled
rule of interpretation that something may be done only in the manner prescribed by the law and in
no other manner. Reliance is placed upon the decision of this Court in the case of Dharani Sugars
and Chemicals Ltd. v. Union of India, (2019) 5 SCC 480 (para 55).
xv) It is further submitted that expanding the scope and purpose of Section 140(5) to include
punishment for fraud, would tantamount to prejudicing the defence that an auditor, in a given case,
could take in any other proceedings. The summary nature in which Section 140(5) aims to
determine fraud may lead to a complete redundancy of all other processes and procedures provided
for under the Companies Act and materially Criminal Appeal Nos.2305-2307/2022 Etc.
Union Of India vs Deloitte Haskins And Sells Llp on 3 May, 2023
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/136418404/
25
impact an auditor's right to fair trial. As an example, the determination of guilt under Section 140(5)
by way of a summary procedure could render the process of defences and appeals provided as a part
of the NFRA process nugatory and a mere formality qua the auditors.
xvi)It is submitted that It is only when the language of provisions in a statute are not clear and
categorical, the purpose of the same can be examined by a court to interpret the provision. It is
submitted that the following principles of law are well settled with regard to the primacy of plain
language interpretation over purposive interpretation:
i. The courts should now be very reluctant to hold that Parliament has achieved
nothing by the language it used, when it is tolerably plain what Parliament wished to
achieve. [See Dr. Jaishri Laxmanrao Patil v. Chief Minister and Others, (2021) 8 SCC
1 (para 150).
ii. The courts will therefore reject that construction which will defeat the plain
intention of the legislature even though there may be some in exactitude in the
language used. [See Jaishri Laxmanrao Patil (supra) (para 151).
Criminal Appeal Nos.2305-2307/2022 Etc.
iii. Purposive interpretation can be given only when there is some ambiguity in the language of the
statutory provisions or it leads to absurd results. [See State of Maharashtra v. Shri Vile Parle Kelvani
Mandal & Ors. (2022) 2 SCC 725 (para 16).
xvii) It is submitted that in addition, this Court has time and again upheld the principle of doubtful
penalisation which requires that "if two views and reasonable constructions can be put on a
provision, the court must lean in favour of construction which exempts the subject from penalty
rather than one which imposes penalty". Reliance is placed on the decision of this Court in the cases
of SEBI v. Sunil Krishna Khaitan, (2023) 2 SCC 643 (Para 55) and Tolaram Relumal v. State of
Bombay. (1955) 1 SCR 158 (Para 8).
xviii) It is submitted that NCLT’s jurisdiction under Section 140(5) of the Act is to direct the removal
of a company’s existing auditor and to allow his substitution by the Central Government. It is
submitted that it is not possible to remove any person/firm from a position which whey are not
holding. Accordingly, an order directing removal of BSR who had already resigned as auditor of
IFIN would only be possible by way of a legal Criminal Appeal Nos.2305-2307/2022 Etc.
fiction of treating BSR as continuing to remain IFIN’s auditor.
xix)It is next submitted that Section 140(5) of the Act does not create any legal fiction by which an
auditor who has resigned would continue to be treated as an auditor. A deeming fiction can only be
created by the legislature. In fact, courts and tribunals do not have the power to create a deeming
fiction by judicial interpretation when the statute does not provide for it. Reliance is placed upon the
decisions of this Court in the cases of Bhuwalka Steel Industries Ltd & Anr v. UOI, (2017) 5 SCC 598
Union Of India vs Deloitte Haskins And Sells Llp on 3 May, 2023

26
(Para 38) and Sant Lal Gupta v. Modern Cooperative Housing Society Ltd., (2010) 13 SCC 336 (Para
14).
xx) It is submitted that the need for a deemed removal of a past auditor does not arise, since the very
purpose and object of Section 140, i.e., removal and change of auditors, has been satisfied by the
auditor's resignation. Such a past auditor can, despite his resignation, be prosecuted for fraud under
Section 447 of the Act. Therefore, the question of removing the auditor under Section 140(5) cannot
and does not arise.
Criminal Appeal Nos.2305-2307/2022 Etc.
xxi)It is submitted that the Ministry was aware that an order under Section 140(5) cannot be passed
against a past auditor except through the device of a deeming fiction. This is evident from prayers
(a), (b) and (c) of the 140(5) Company Petition sought qua Deloitte in which Ministry sought a
"deemed removal" of Deloitte even though it had already rotated out as auditor. Consequently,
NCLT could not have gone into the merits of the 140(5) Company Petition itself as the relief sought
for was beyond NCLT's powers.
xxii) It is submitted that further, the prayers in the Company Petition sought against BSR became
infructuous with its resignation on 19 June 2019. Pertinently, no "deemed removal" prayer was
sought against BSR after its resignation. Despite this, NCLT proceeded to create a deeming fiction so
as to clutch at its jurisdiction to pass an order under Section 140(5) against BSR.
xxiii) It is then submitted that NCLT, exercising powers under Section 140(5), cannot direct removal
of past auditors or deem such auditors to have been removed at a previous date. NCLT, being a
creature of a statute, has to act within the domain prescribed by the Criminal Appeal
Nos.2305-2307/2022 Etc.
law/statutory provision. Thus, NCLT cannot exercise power which has not been expressly vested in
it, by directing a "deemed change in auditors. Reliance is placed upon the decisions of this Court in
the cases of B. Himmatlal Agrawal v Competition Commission of India, AIR 2018 SC 2804 (para 8)
and Cellular Operators Association of India v. Union of India, (2003) 3 SCC 186 (para 20-21).
xxiv) It is submitted that in Pasupuleti Venkateswarlu v. Motor & General Traders, (1975) 1 SCC 770,
this Court held that a proceeding may not be maintainable by reasons of a post filing event. This
Court observed "If a fact, arising after the lis has come to court and has a fundamental impact on the
right to relief for the manner of moulding it, is brought diligently to the notice of the tribunal, it
cannot blink at it or be blind to events which stultify or render inept the decrotal remedy."
xxv) It is submitted that in the present case although BSR resigned after the filing of the 140(5)
petition, the resignation rendered the petition infructuous since the reliefs sought for could no
longer be granted under Section 140(5) and indeed the Criminal Appeal Nos.2305-2307/2022 Etc.
purpose underlying Section 140(5) stood accomplished by such resignation.

xxvi) It is submitted that reading in an implied prohibition against an auditor from resigning after
the commencement of proceedings under Section 140(5) would be contrary to the plain language of
the section and would require it to be re-written. Such an implied provision would also be contrary
to the object of Section 140(5) as it would mean that the provision ensures that an auditor against
whom allegations of fraud have: been made continues as auditor and is not permitted to resign. This
would lead to an anomalous situation of compelling the continuance of an auditor, despite him
having committed a fraud until the NCLT passes a final order or an interim order under the first
proviso to Section 140(5).
xxvii) It is further submitted by the learned counsel appearing on behalf of the original writ
petitioners that Section 140(5) is excessive and manifestly arbitrary as it provides unguided and
untrammelled powers to NCLT and that too in a summary proceeding, for determination of a
serious offence of fraud and consequence of mandatory disqualification with grave Criminal Appeal
Nos.2305-2307/2022 Etc.
consequences akin to civil death. It is submitted that the penalty in the form of automatic
disqualification of auditors and of the entire firm including partners who may be entirely
unconnected and innocent for a pre- determined period envisaged under Section 140(5) is highly
disproportionate and not the least invasive method. It is submitted that Section 140(5) creates an
automatic penalty of disqualification, upon summary adjudication, when such a penalty has already
been provided for under section 141(3)(h) of the Act after following due process of trial under
Sections 435 to 446 of the Act. The same results in contravention of the principles of double
jeopardy and violation of Article 20(2) of the Constitution. It is submitted that disqualification akin
to "civil death" under Section 140(5) impinges upon BSR and its partners' fundamental right to
carry on its profession, as guaranteed under Article 19(1)(g) of the Constitution. The same, being
unreasonable, does not fall within the protection of Article 19(6) of the Constitution of India. It is
submitted that applying Section 140(5) in its plain language i.e., to change of auditors, saves it from
the Criminal Appeal Nos.2305-2307/2022 Etc.
above serious constitutional infraction without letting auditors "off the hook" under the Companies
Act.
xxviii) It is submitted that the NCLT, vide its first Order, erroneously upheld its jurisdiction to
maintain the 140(5) Company Petition against past auditors of IFIN, including BSR, by incorrectly
creating a deeming fiction, in absence of any legislation to this effect or the necessary jurisdiction
and power to do so. It is submitted that the NCLT wrongly assumed jurisdiction by holding that it
was empowered to pass directions for a deemed change of ex-auditors and therefore the NCLT’s first
order is contrary to Section 140(5) as it was passed without jurisdiction and based on an incorrect
assumption that the jurisdictional fact that the existing auditors of the company needed to be
"changed" existed.
xxix) It is submitted that it is trite law that a "jurisdictional fact' is a sine qua non or the condition
precedent to the assumption of jurisdiction by a court. A court cannot erroneously assume
jurisdiction either by not deciding the jurisdictional fact or by erroneously deciding it. Reliance is

placed upon the decisions of this Court in the cases of Carona Ltd. v. Parvathy Criminal Appeal
Nos.2305-2307/2022 Etc.
Swaminathan & Sons, (2007) 8 SCC 559 (Para 27, 28, 36) and Arun Kumar v. Union of India,
(2007) 1 SCC 732 (Para 74-76). It is submitted that this Court has clearly laid down that the
foundational fact must be established before a presumption is made. Reliance is placed on the
decision of this Court in the case of Balram Garg v. SEBI, (2022) 9 SCC 425 (Para 45 and
51).
xxx) It is further submitted that even the NCLT’s second order on the application filed by the
Ministry for the appointment of MMC as the statutory auditor of IFIN under the first proviso to
Section 140(5) is wholly without jurisdiction. It is submitted that once the BSR resigned as an
auditor, there was no question of invoking first proviso to section 140(5) of the Act.
xxxi) It is submitted that statutory auditor appointment application was clearly contrary to law,
without jurisdiction and could not have been under the first proviso to Section 140(5) since firstly,
Section 140(5) itself did not apply to the past auditors, and hence no question of invoking the first
proviso could arise; secondly, the first proviso is only a pro tem measure pending a jurisdiction
order under Section Criminal Appeal Nos.2305-2307/2022 Etc.
140(5); thirdly, the NCLT’s second order is not in the nature of a pro tem order; fourthly, once the
proceedings under section 140(5) of the Act are initiated, only the Central Government is authorised
to appoint or change the auditors under the first proviso. Under the first proviso to section 140(5),
the power given to Central Government to appoint an auditor due to urgency, does not take away the
power of the concerned company to appoint an auditor of its choice; fifthly, BSR had admittedly
already resigned and vacated its office, as accepted by the Ministry in its submissions before this
Court and this Court noted the same in the order dated 26.09.2019. It is submitted that moreover,
the Ministry withheld various key facts from the NCLT at the time of filing.
4.1 Now so far as the direction issued under Section 212(14) and the prosecution under Section
212(15), it is submitted as under:
i) Section 212(1) provides that the Central Government may direct the SPIO to investigate into the
affairs of a company inter alia upon a receipt of the report of the Registrar, on intimation of a special
Criminal Appeal Nos.2305-2307/2022 Etc.
resolution passed by a company, in public interest or on request from any Department of the Central
Government or State Government;
ii) Section 212(11) provides that SFIO must submit an "interim report" to the Central Government, if
the SFIO is directed to do so by the Central Government;
Union Of India vs Deloitte Haskins And Sells Llp on 3 May, 2023
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/136418404/
29
iii) Section 212(12) requires SFIO to submit an "investigation report" to the Central Government
only upon "completion of the investigation". Therefore, an "investigation report" cannot be
submitted at any time prior to the completion of the investigation, whereas an "interim report"
under Section 212(11) can be submitted at any stage;
iv) Under Section 212(14), the Central Government has been empowered to direct SPIO to initiate
prosecution against a company or its officers, if the Central Government considers it necessary after
examination of only the "investigation report" issued under Section 212(12), i.e., after completion of
the investigation. Reliance is placed on the decision of this Court in the case of Serious Fraud
Investigation Office v Rahul Modi (2019) 5 SCC 266 (Para 30);
Criminal Appeal Nos.2305-2307/2022 Etc.
v) Section 212(14) permits the Central Government to take legal advice when examining the
"investigation report", which itself gives colour to the word "examination" and shows that the
Central Government is to properly apply its mind to the "investigation report" before directing
initiation of prosecution, Le, not to do so mechanically or for collateral purposes;
vi) Section 212(14A) provides that where the report under Section 212(11) or 212(12) stated that
fraud has taken place and has been taken advantage of by a director, key managerial personnel or
other officer, the Central Government may file an application before the NCLT for appropriate
orders for disgorgement of asset and for holding such person liable personally;
vii) Under Section 212(15), it is only the "investigation report" (submitted only upon completion of
the investigation which is filed with the Special Court is deemed to be police officer's report under
Section 173 of the Criminal Procedure Code, 1973. (CHPC) Significantly, Section 212(15) is a
deeming fiction that is limited to only making investigation report under Section 212(12), to be the
police officer's report under Section 173, CrPC;
Criminal Appeal Nos.2305-2307/2022 Etc.
viii) It is therefore clear that the legislature has envisaged two distinct kinds of reports, with its own
specific purpose. The first kind of report is under Section 212(11). which report is an 'Interim Report'
and can be issued at any point of time during the course of investigation by the SFIO. The 2nd kind
of report is an 'Investigation Report" which can be issued only after completion of the investigation
by the SFIO. Only the Investigation Report' can be considered by the Central Government under
Section 212(14) for the purposes of commencement of prosecution. On the other hand, an action
before the NCLT under Section 212(14A) can be brought on based on either the Investigation Report
or even the Interim Report;
ix) It is further clear that the Central Government, under Section 212(14) is required to apply its
mind, seek legal opinion (if required) and only thereafter decide whether or not a sanction order is
to be issued, i.e., if in its opinion prosecution is to be initiated based on the "Investigation Report'.
Further, only such 'Investigation Report', which is considered by the Central Government for the
Union Of India vs Deloitte Haskins And Sells Llp on 3 May, 2023

30
initiation of prosecution under Section 212(14), Criminal Appeal Nos.2305-2307/2022 Etc.
is to be the police officer's report under Section 173, CrPC;
x) It is submitted that in the present case, SFIO's 2nd Interim Report is an "Interim report" and was
not issued upon "completion of the investigation". As such, the 2 Interim Report is not an
"investigation report" under Section 212(12) of the Act and could not have been considered by the
Central Government under Section 212(14) for the purposes of issuing the Sanction Order;
xi) The present case is not a case of invalidity/irregularity of sanction but a case of no sanction at all,
since the pre-requisite to the sanction, i.e., a final investigation report, is absent;
xii) As is evident from above, where an investigation report itself states that the investigation is
incomplete or that further evidence is yet to be collected, then such an investigation report does not
meet the obligatory requirements of law and cannot be considered a final investigation report under
Section 173(2) of the CrPC. Reliance is placed on the following decisions in the cases of P.M.C
Mercantile Private Ltd. v. The State 2014(3) MWN (Cr.) 454 (Para 11 and 19); Pravin Criminal
Appeal Nos.2305-2307/2022 Etc.
Chandra Modi v. The State of Andhra Pradesh, Crl. App. No. 49, 1964; Hari Chand & Ram Pal v.
State Crl. Misc. (M) 99 & 111 of 1977 ( Para 14).
Accordingly, given the language of paras 1.5 and 4.126.1 of the 2nd Interim SFIO Report, that report
could never be treated as an investigation report under Section 212(12);
xiii) Even while examining the 2nd Interim Report, the MCA was of the view that the 2nd Interim
Report was not a complete investigation report with respect to IFIN. Accordingly, the Ministry had
directed the SFIO to carry out further investigation on aspects which were already covered in the
2nd Interim Report;
xiv) Further, the Ministry and the SFIO, despite being afforded ample opportunity, did not place on
record any affidavit or argument to explain Para V of the Sanction Order or that the investigation
was complete and that the 2nd Interim Report was not treated by the Ministry as an interim report.
The SFIO cannot avoid the consequences of not having filed an affidavit, stating on oath, that the
investigation was not complete. This is a question of fact;
Criminal Appeal Nos.2305-2307/2022 Etc.
xv) Section 212(12), does not permit initiation of prosecution based on a report which is issued till
such time investigation has been completed. This is clear from a conjoint reading of Sections
212(12), (14) and (15). Further, though Section 173(8) of the CrPC contemplates a further
investigation after filing of a report under Section 173(2), it is trite that Section 173(8) does not
enable the inspector to submit an incomplete or preliminary report and later on submit a final
report. Reliance is placed on the following decisions in the cases of Kamal Lochan Sen v. State of
Union Of India vs Deloitte Haskins And Sells Llp on 3 May, 2023
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/136418404/
31
Orissa (1982) 54 CLT 509 (Para 5) and AV Dharma Reddy v. State of A.P. & Ors., 2011 CriLJ 185
(Para 5). Therefore, the stratagem adopted by SFIO and the Ministry in proceeding to act based on
an "interim report" and simultaneously carrying on a further investigation is illegal;
xvi) Since the investigation itself was not complete and the 2nd Interim SFIO Report is merely an
interim report, there was no basis for the Ministry to issue a direction under Section 212(14) to
initiate prosecution. Accordingly, the Sanction Order is ultra yes. It does not Criminal Appeal
Nos.2305-2307/2022 Etc.
constitute sanction and the prosecution is void ab initio and a nullity;
xvii) The Sanction Order was passed without application of mind to the relevant material and
evidence;
xviii) Section 212(14) requires an "examination" by the Central Government and even contemplates
"legal advice" being taken, if required. The Parliament sets out a superior degree of care that is
required while passing an order under Section 212(14). Therefore, the Central Government's
decision must be reasoned and must be made with proper application of mind;
xix) In law, the order of sanction must disclose both adequacy of material as well as consideration of
the relevant facts, material and evidence by the sanctioning authority. Reliance is placed on the
decision of this Court in the case of Mansukhbhai Vithaldas Chauhan v. State of Gujarat (1997) 7
SCC 622 (Paras 17, 18 and 19);
xx) SFIO submitted the 2nd Interim SFIO Report on 28.05.2019. Admittedly, the report comprised
of over 32,000 pages, with the body of the report itself forming Criminal Appeal
Nos.2305-2307/2022 Etc.
approximately 787 pages. The 2 Interim SFIO Report was allegedly examined by a Processing
Officer (Legal Section), Ministry who had prepared a processing note. This processing note was
allegedly submitted to the 'Senior Officer' on an urgent priority basis. Despite the above internal
processes, Ministry issued the Sanction Order on 29.05.2019 (i.e., within one day). It is pertinent to
note that a copy of the said processing note was not placed before the Bombay High Court or
provided to BSR despite repeated requests for inspection vide emails dated 01.10.2019, 10.10.2019,
and 14.10.2019. The Bombay High Court, in these circumstances, was correct to draw adverse
inference since Ministry and SFIO failed to demonstrate due application of mind through any
document or affidavit;
xxi)Given the voluminous nature of the 2nd Interim SFIO Report and the internal processes in
place, it was impossible for Ministry to examine and apply its mind to the 2nd Interim SFIO Report
(as required under Section 212(14) of the Act) within one day before it issued the Sanction Order.
The events described above clearly show that the Sanction Order was granted in haste, without
application of mind and for extraneous Criminal Appeal Nos.2305-2307/2022 Etc.

consideration. As such, the proceedings following such Sanction Order also stand vitiated. Reliance
is placed upon the decisions of this Court in the cases of K.K Mishra v. State of Madhya Pradesh,
(2018) 6 SCC 676 (Para 18) and Anirudhsinhji Karansinhji Jadeja v. State of Gujarat (1995) 5 SCC
302 (Para 15);
xxii) Further, Ministry’s failure to produce any evidence to demonstrate that its officers
independently applied their minds to the 2nd Interim SFIO Report is also contrary to the principles
relating to duty of disclosure since disclosure would protect the fairness of the proceedings and also
enhance the transparency of the process. Reliance is placed upon the decision of this Court in the
case of T.Takano v. SEBI, (2022) 8 SCC 162 (Para 62.3);
xxiii) It is therefore submitted that the Sanction Order is bad in law and the Bombay High Court
rightly quashed the same;
xxiv) A mandatory prerequisite to jurisdiction is the existence of a valid sanction. Therefore, the
prosecution becomes incompetent and consequently the proceedings are vitiated and without
jurisdiction Criminal Appeal Nos.2305-2307/2022 Etc.
where no valid sanction is granted. Reliance is placed on the decisions in the cases of Gokulchand

Cri LJ 889 ( Para 15); Mohd. Iqbal Ahmed v. State of Andhra Pradesh (1979) 4 SCC 172 (Para 3);
xxv) The Sanction Order issued by MCA under Section 212(14) is invalid and non-est. In such
circumstances, it is submitted that the prosecution initiated by SFIO is absent any sanction and
hence a nullity and without any jurisdiction.
4.2 Learned counsel appearing on behalf of respondent No.1 in Criminal Appeal No. 2300/2011 –
Hari Sankaran, in addition, has further submitted that in the present matter no final investigation
report has been filed by the SFIO qua Hari Sankaran. It is submitted that the second report is not in
the nature of final investigation report qua Hari Sankaran. It is submitted that since the second
report was not a final investigation report qua Hari Sankaran, direction for prosecution in question
could not have been issued and therefore consequently the complaint could not have been filed qua
Hari Sankaran.
Criminal Appeal Nos.2305-2307/2022 Etc.
4.3 Making above submissions and relying upon the aforesaid decisions, it is prayed by the learned
counsel appearing on behalf of the original writ petitioners to dismiss the present appeals and
uphold the impugned judgment and order passed by the High Court.
Analysis and Interpretation of Section 140(5)of the Companies Act, 2013:
5. Section 140(5) of the Act, 2013 titled as “Removal, Resignation of Auditor and Giving of Special
Notice” appears in Chapter X of the Act which is titled as “Audit and Auditors”. Therefore, Chapter

X is a special provision under the new Act with respect of “Audit and Auditors”. It cannot be
disputed that the auditor plays a very important role so far as the affairs of any company are
concerned and therefore he should be independent and above board. Companies Act, 2013 is the
result of the culmination of detailed study after taking into consideration the Parliamentary
Standing Committee on Finance Report as well as the recommendations of the Standing Committee
by introducing Companies Bill, 2009 and Companies Bill, 2011. When the earlier Companies Bill,
2009 was introduced, it was a culmination of the growing corporate Criminal Appeal
Nos.2305-2307/2022 Etc.
economy and past experiences of corporate fiascos too and one of the suggestions were to provide
for stricter accountability for auditors. There was a long discussion on the role, responsibility, duties
and regulation of auditors and the regulatory and enforcement provisions. Various suggestions were
received to make the provisions pertaining to Audit and Auditors more stringent. It was suggested
on Clause 123(10) of the 2009 Bill which provides for removal of an auditor by the NCLT on finding
that there is a fraud and corresponds to Section 140(5) of the Act should be made more stringent
and should contemplate that an auditor removed by the Tribunal should not be eligible to be
appointed as an auditor of any company for a period of five years.
5.1 At this stage, it is required to be noted that Section 143 of the Act deals with the powers and
duties of the auditors. Sub-section (12) of Section 143 specifically provides that in the event that the
auditor has reason to believe that an offence of fraud is being or has been committed in the
company, the auditor shall report the matter to the Central Government. The detailed procedure is
provided under the Rules issued in this regard. Therefore, a statutory duty is cast upon the Criminal
Appeal Nos.2305-2307/2022 Etc.
auditor to report the matter to the Central Government about the offence of fraud being committed
in a company. To see that the auditor is not holding any post in the company and he acts
independently, Section 144 of the Act provides that the auditor cannot provide certain services
including the management services. The objective seems to be that the auditor should function as an
independent person uninfluenced by any of its activities outside the scope of audit services. The
auditor is prohibited from providing any management service to the company. Thus, the prohibition
and restriction created under Section 144 of the Act is primarily to protect the interest of the
company in question and other stakeholders such as lenders and investors and the public at large.
Keeping inb mind the aforesaid provisions and the underlying public policy in the backdrop, Section
140(5) of the Act, 2013 is required to be interpreted and/or considered.
5.2 Section 140(1) of the Act provides for the procedure to remove an auditor by the company before
the expiry of his term; section 140(2) and (3) of the Act deal with resignation of auditors and Section
140(4) of the Act deals with giving of special notice at an AGM for appointment of Criminal Appeal
Nos.2305-2307/2022 Etc.
an auditor other than the retiring auditor and the process in that regard. However, Section 140(5) of
the Act empowers the Tribunal (NCLT), either suo motu or on an application made to it by the
Central Government or by any person concerned, to take action against the auditor who has acted in
Union Of India vs Deloitte Haskins And Sells Llp on 3 May, 2023

a fraudulent manner or is abetting or colluding in fraud with the management of a company. If on
completion of an enquiry it is found by the Tribunal that an auditor of a company has, whether
directly or indirectly, acted in a fraudulent manner or abetted or colluded in any fraud by, or in
relation to, the company or its directors or officers, it may by order direct the company to change its
auditors. Therefore, powers of the NCLT in first part of Section 140(5) is quasi-judicial in nature and
the Tribunal would have the powers of a civil court to examine the role of auditors and adjudicate on
their fraudulent conduct and abdication of their function. The first proviso to Section 140(5) confers
power upon the Tribunal on the application made by the Central Government and if the Tribunal is
satisfied that any change of the auditor is required, to remove such auditor and/or pass an order
that such an auditor shall not function as an auditor (within 15 days of receipt of such Criminal
Appeal Nos.2305-2307/2022 Etc.
application) and the Central Government may appoint another auditor in his place. Thus, the
powers under the first proviso to Section 140(5) can be said to be interim or pro tem measure to
prevent an existing auditor from continuing and substitute him with an auditor based on a prima
facie satisfaction that a fraud has been perpetrated and when circumstances warrant the
substitution. Such an order can be said to be an interim order akin to a temporary suspension
during the pendency of the detailed enquiry as provided in Section 140(5) of the Act and before any
final order is passed by the Tribunal.
5.3 Second proviso to section 140(5) of the Act further provides that an auditor, whether individual
or firm, against whom final order has been passed by the Tribunal under section 140(5) shall not be
eligible to be appointed as an auditor of any company for a period of five years from the date of
passing of the order and the auditor shall also be liable of such action under section 447 of the
Companies Act. Therefore, as such, second proviso to Section 140(5) can be said to be a substantive
provision and it operates on the final order passed by the Tribunal under Section 140(5) (first part).
At this stage, it is required to be noted that after taking into consideration Criminal Appeal
Nos.2305-2307/2022 Etc.
the recommendations made by the previous Standing Committee in respect of Companies Bill, 2009
and the recommendations from various stakeholders, the Companies Bill, 2011 came to be
introduced. The suggestion of the Standing Committee to clause 123(1) of the 2009 Bill (which
provided for removal of an auditor by the NCLT on finding that there is a fraud) was to make the
provision more stringent; and to provide for consequences for an auditor when such auditor is
found to have been perpetrating a fraud and is removed by the NCLT for such fraud. The same has
been done by way of second proviso to Section 140(5) of the Act, 2013. Therefore, the second proviso
to Section 140(5) which, as observed hereinabove, is a substantive provision, is introduced after a
detailed analysis and after taking into consideration the recommendations of the Standing
Committee and with a view to make the provision more stringent and to provide for consequences
for an auditor when such auditor is found to have been perpetrating a fraud and is removed by the
NCLT for such fraud. It is required to be noted that on passing of the final order by the NCLT under
first part of section 140(5) and if an auditor is found to have been indulged into fraudulent activities
or abetting or colluding Criminal Appeal Nos.2305-2307/2022 Etc.
Union Of India vs Deloitte Haskins And Sells Llp on 3 May, 2023

35
in a fraud with the management of the company, consequences provided under the second proviso
to section 140(5) shall follow. Therefore, before second proviso of section 140(5) is attracted, there
must be a detailed enquiry against an auditor of a company as per first part of section 140(5) and
there must be a finding arrived at by the NCLT that the auditor of a company has, directly or
indirectly, acted in a fraudulent manner or abetted or colluded in any fraud by, or in relation to, the
company or its directors or officers.
6. By the impugned judgment and order, though the High Court has upheld the vires of Section
140(5) of the Act, 2013, however, the High Court has held that once the auditor resigns as an auditor
or is no more an auditor on his resignation, thereafter Section 140(5) proceedings are no longer
maintainable as the petition filed by the Union of India under section 140(5) has been satisfied by
the subsequent resignation of the auditor. The view taken by the High Court is absolutely erroneous
and is unsustainable. Subsequent resignation of an auditor after the application is filed under
section 140(5) by itself shall not terminate the proceedings under section 140(5). Resignation
and/or removal of an auditor cannot be said Criminal Appeal Nos.2305-2307/2022 Etc.
to be an end of the proceedings under section 140(5). There are further consequences also on
culmination of the enquiry under section 140(5) proceedings and passing a final order by the
Tribunal on the conduct of an auditor, whether such a auditor has, directly or indirectly, acted in a
fraudulent manner or abetted or colluded in any fraud by, or in relation to, the company or its
directors or officers, as provided under the second proviso to section 140(5) of the Act, 2013.
Therefore, the enquiry/proceedings initiated under the first part of section 140(5) has to go to its
logical end and subsequent resignation and/or discontinuance of an auditor shall not terminate the
enquiry/proceedings under section 140(5). If the interpretation given by the High Court that once
an auditor resigns, the proceedings under section 140(5) stand terminated and are no longer further
required to be proceeded, in that case, an auditor to avoid the final order and the consequence of
final order as provided under the second proviso to section 140(5) may resign and avoid any final
order by the Tribunal. That cannot be the intention of the legislature.
6.1 As observed hereinabove, the second proviso to section 140(5) of the Act, 2013 is a substantive
provision, Criminal Appeal Nos.2305-2307/2022 Etc.
though it is by way of a proviso, and the same shall operate and/or depend upon the final order to be
passed by the Tribunal in the first part of section 140(5). If the interpretation given by the High
Court that on subsequent resignation and/or discontinuance of an auditor, proceedings under
section 140(5) stand terminated and/or the petition under section 140(5) by the Central
Government is no longer maintainable is accepted, in that case, second proviso to section 140(5)
would become nugatory and in no case there shall be any action under the second proviso to section
140(5). If such an interpretation, as interpreted by the High Court, is accepted, in that case, the
object and purpose of incorporation of second proviso to section 140(5) shall be frustrated. The
object and purpose of second proviso to section 140(5), as observed hereinabove, is to make the
provision more stringent and to provide for consequences for an auditor when such an auditor is
found to have been perpetrating a fraud and is removed by the NCLT for such fraud. At this stage, it
is required to be noted that under the second proviso to section 140(5) on the final order being
Union Of India vs Deloitte Haskins And Sells Llp on 3 May, 2023
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/136418404/
36
passed by the Tribunal that the auditor/firm has, directly or indirectly, acted in a fraudulent manner
or Criminal Appeal Nos.2305-2307/2022 Etc.
abetted or colluded in any fraud by, or in relation to, the company or its directors or officers, he/it
shall not be eligible to be appointed as an auditor of any company for a period of five years. The
word “any” used in the second proviso to section 140(5) is significant. On the final order being
passed by the Tribunal, such an auditor not only shall be removed or changed as an auditor of a
company, but such an auditor/firm shall also be ineligible to be appointed as an auditor of any other
company for a period of five years.
7. Therefore, on true interpretation and scheme of Section 140(5) of the Act, 2013, once the
enquiry/proceedings is/are initiated under first part of section 140(5) of the Act, either suo motu by
the Tribunal or on an application made to it by the Central Government or by any person concerned,
it must come to its logical end and irrespective of the fact whether during such enquiry/proceedings
the auditor has resigned or not, there must be a final order to be passed by the Tribunal on whether
such an auditor has, in fact, directly or indirectly, acted in a fraudulent manner or not. Direction to
the company to change its auditor as provided in the first part of section 140(5) is only a
consequence to the finding Criminal Appeal Nos.2305-2307/2022 Etc.
recorded by the Tribunal that the auditor has, directly or indirectly, acted in a fraudulent manner.
This is the first consequence of the final order under section 140(5) (first part). On passing the final
order by the Tribunal that the auditor of a company has, directly or indirectly, acted in a fraudulent
manner, the second consequence as mentioned in the second proviso to section 140(5) shall be
attracted. Therefore, for any consequence as provided under the second proviso to section 140(5),
there shall be a final order by the Tribunal on enquiry as per first part of section 140(5). Therefore,
on true interpretation, even on resignation by an auditor of a company even during the
enquiry/proceedings under section 140(5) or even prior to that, there shall not be any termination
of the proceedings under section 140(5) as observed and held by the High Court. At the cost of
repetition, it is observed that in a given case, an auditor, who in fact has, directly or indirectly, acted
in a fraudulent manner, to avoid any further consequence under the second proviso to section
140(5), resigns to avoid any consequence under the second proviso to section 140(5), it cannot be
permitted.
8. No so far as the submission on behalf of the respective auditors that even if section 140(5) would

have been there, in that case also, no auditor can get away with fraud, abetment of fraud or
professional misconduct etc. and for that purpose the reliance placed upon sections 132, 141, 147,
245 and 447 of the Act is concerned, at the outset, it is required to be noted that all the aforesaid
provisions and section 140(5) operate in different field. Section 140(5) has been enacted with a
special object and purpose, as observed hereinabove. Second proviso to section 140(5) specifically
provides that on final order being passed by the NCLT, such an auditor shall not be eligible to
become an auditor in any other company for a period of five years. Therefore, merely because the
auditor can be removed as an auditor of a company including the other provisions, section 140(5)
Union Of India vs Deloitte Haskins And Sells Llp on 3 May, 2023

37
which has been enacted with a special object and purpose cannot be said to be arbitrary and/or ultra
vires.
9. Now so far as the reliance placed upon section 241(3) of the Act and the submission that even in a
case where the auditor resigns, the auditor concerned can be proceeded against under section 241(3)
of the Act and therefore the proceedings pursuant to section 241(3) of the Act would lead to the
same result and the auditor would be held ‘not to be a fit and proper person’ to be Criminal Appeal
Nos.2305-2307/2022 Etc.
appointed in any other office connected with the conduct and management of any company is
concerned, at the outset, it is required to be noted that Section 241(3) of the Act speaks about the
concerned company and not any other company. Section 241(3) of the Act has been introduced
w.e.f. 14.08.2019 which authorises the Central Government to apply to the Tribunal to declare that
the persons mentioned in section 241(3) of the Act are “not fit and proper persons” to hold the office
of a director or any other office connected with the conduct and management of any company.
Section 241(3) of the Act is required to be read along with Sections 243(1A) and 243(2). On a
conjoint reading of the aforesaid provisions, it is clear that the reference specifically in Section
241(3) of the Act to “any other office connected with the conduct and management of any company”
means those akin to manager, managing director or other director such as key managerial personnel
and not an auditor. The words used in Section 241(3) of the Act are “conduct and management of
the company”. As per the Scheme of the Act, 2013, more particularly Chapter X, the auditor acts as
an independent examiner of accounts and cannot be said to be holding an office in the conduct and
management of Criminal Appeal Nos.2305-2307/2022 Etc.
the company. Therefore, the submission that what could be achieved under section 140(5) of the
Act, 2013 can be achieved by Section 241(3) even after the auditor has resigned has no substance.
10. At this stage, it is required to be noted that in section 140(5), it is specifically mentioned that
“without prejudice to any action under the provisions of this Act or any other law for the time being
in force”. Therefore, the intention of the legislature while enacting section 140(5) is very clear and
the powers conferred upon the Tribunal under section 140(5) shall be without prejudice to any
action under the provisions of the Companies Act, 2013 or any other law for the time being in force.
Therefore, irrespective of any other provisions of the Act, 2013, the Tribunal is vested with the
powers under Section 140(5) of the Act to pass a final order against the auditor on the allegation that
such an auditor of the company has, directly or indirectly, acted in a fraudulent manner.
11. For the reasons stated above, the High Court has materially erred in holding that on resignation
of auditors – BSR & Deloitte and on appoint of new auditors, application under section 140(5) shall
not be maintainable. Consequently, the High Court has erred in Criminal Appeal
Nos.2305-2307/2022 Etc.
setting aside the order(s) passed by the NCLT/NCLAT by which the NCLT/NCLAT held that despite
the resignation of the auditors, enquiry/proceedings under Section 140(5) shall be maintainable
and/or continued. As observed hereinabove, despite the subsequent resignation of the auditors
Union Of India vs Deloitte Haskins And Sells Llp on 3 May, 2023
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/136418404/
38
and/or despite the resignation of an auditor even for the purpose of second proviso to section
140(5), the enquiry/proceedings/application under section 140(5) (first part) shall be maintainable
and continued and on the final order being passed by the NCLT, as provided in section 140(5),
consequence as provided under the second proviso to section 140(5) shall follow. As neither the
NCLT nor the High Court have gone into the merits of the allegations against the respective auditors
and the decision of the NCLT and the High Court is on the maintainability of the proceedings under
section 140(5) after resignation of the auditors, we refrain from considering anything on merits of
the allegations against the auditors as the allegations of fraud etc. are yet to be considered by the
Tribunal on merits in an application under Section 140(5) made by the Central Government.
12. Now so far as challenge to the vires of Section 140(5) of the Act is concerned, at the outset, it is
required Criminal Appeal Nos.2305-2307/2022 Etc.
to be noted that the High Court, as such, has upheld the constitutional validity/vires of section
140(5) against which the BSR has not filed any special leave petition. Even otherwise on merits also,
when some of the writ petitioners have challenged the impugned judgment and order passed by the
High Court on constitutional validity/vires of Section 140(5), we are of the opinion that section
140(5) cannot be said to be excessive and/or manifestly arbitrary, as contended. It was the case on
behalf of the original writ petitioners on the constitutionality/vires of section 140(5) that section
140(5) is excessive and arbitrary as it provides unguided and untrammelled powers to NCLT for
determination of a serious offence of fraud and consequence of mandatory disqualification with
grave consequences akin to civil death. The aforesaid has no substance. As observed hereinabove,
NCLT shall exercise the quasi-judicial powers under section 140(5) with all the powers akin to civil
court. Ample opportunity shall be given by the NCLT before passing any final order.
13. Now so far as another submission that section 140(5) is violative of Article 14 of the Constitution
of India and discriminates against the auditors unfairly in Criminal Appeal Nos.2305-2307/2022
Etc.
comparison to similarly placed alleged perpetrators, such as directors, management etc. It is
required to be noted that the role of auditors cannot be equated with directors and/or management.
Auditors play very important role in the affairs of the company and therefore they have to act in the
larger public interest and all other stakeholders including investors etc. Chapter X of the Act
specifically for the “Audit and Auditors” looking to the importance of the auditors. Therefore,
section 140(5) cannot be said to be discriminatory and/or violative of Article 14 of the Constitution
of India.
14. Now so far as the submission that the penalty in the form of automatic disqualification of
auditors and of the entire firm including partners and that too for a period of five years to become
the auditor of any other company is highly disproportionate is concerned, it is ultimately for the
legislature/Parliament to provide the debarment. On the principle of joint and severe liability, the
auditors and the entire firm including partners shall be liable and therefore can be subjected to
section 140(5) and the consequences mentioned in section 140(5) of the Act, 2013. So far as the
submission that the disqualification is akin to civil death and section 140(5) impinges upon BSR and

its Criminal Appeal Nos.2305-2307/2022 Etc.
partners’ fundamental right to carry on its profession, as guaranteed under Article 19(1)(g) of the
Constitution is concerned, nobody can be permitted to say that despite acting fraudulently, directly
or indirectly, they had a right to continue and/or carrying on their profession. Acting in a fraudulent
manner, directly or indirectly, by an auditor is a very serious misconduct and therefore the
necessary consequence of indulging into such fraudulent act shall follow.
At this stage, it is required to be noted and as observed hereinabove, Section 140(5) of the Act has
been enacted with the specific object and purpose as referred to hereinabove and the same has been
enacted after due deliberations and taking into consideration the recommendations of the Standing
Committee as well as the respective stakeholders. Therefore, taking into consideration the object
and purpose for which section 140(5) of the Act is enacted, the same cannot be said to be arbitrary,
excessive and violative of Article 14 of the Constitution of India and/or violative of fundamental
rights guaranteed under Article 19(1)(g) of the Constitution of India, as alleged.
Criminal Appeal Nos.2305-2307/2022 Etc.
15. Now far as quashing and setting aside section 212(14) direction by the High Court by its
impugned judgment and order is concerned, it appears that the High Court has set aside 212(14)
direction mainly on two grounds, firstly, that the direction to prosecute was issued within 30 hours
of report of the IFIN SFIO Report which demonstrates non-application of mind and secondly on the
ground that IFIN SFIO Report was an incomplete report as investigation had not been completed
and therefore 212(14) direction was incompetent.
15.1 From the reasoning of the High Court, it appears that the High Court has set aside the direction
under section 212(14) terming the same as non-application of mind since it was improbable that
report of about 750 pages and 32000 pages of annexures could have been considered in 30 hours.
The High Court also observed that the relevant facts and documents to demonstrate application of
mind have not been placed on record. With the above conclusion, the High Court has observed that
even according to the investigating agency, SFIO Report was an interim report, even asked by the
Central Government.
Criminal Appeal Nos.2305-2307/2022 Etc.
15.2 Now so far as the observations made by the High Court that issuance of the direction to
prosecute within 30 hours of the receipt of IFIN SFIO Report demonstrates non-application of mind
as it was improbable that report of about 750 pages and 32000 pages of annexures could have been
considered in 30 hours is concerned, the observations made by the High Court cannot be accepted.
Merely because the direction to prosecute was issued within 30 hours, by that itself, it cannot be
presumed that there was a non-application of mind. A detailed note was prepared by the officer
which was ultimately placed before the final authority who ultimately took a decision and issued a
direction to prosecute. What was required to be considered was, whether there was any material to
prosecute or not and whether the direction to prosecute was properly given or not. During the trial,
Union Of India vs Deloitte Haskins And Sells Llp on 3 May, 2023

40
the accused shall be given ample opportunity to put forward their case. Therefore, on the aforesaid
ground, the High Court has materially erred in setting aside the direction to prosecute issued under
section 212(14) of the Act.
Now so far as the observations made by the High Court that the relevant facts and documents to
Criminal Appeal Nos.2305-2307/2022 Etc.
demonstrate application of mind have not been placed on record is concerned, it is required to be
noted that a final order to prosecute was placed on record in which it has been specifically
mentioned that having gone through the IFIN SFIO Report.
15.3 Now so far as another ground on which the direction/sanction to prosecute has been set aside
by the High Court, namely, that it was an incomplete investigation report and therefore on such an
incomplete investigation report, no direction/sanction to prosecute could have been issued is
concerned, at the outset, it is required to be noted that the High Court has not properly appreciated
that the SFIO IFIN Report was a report prepared by the SFIO on the completion of the investigation
into the IFIN – one of the companies under investigation. It is required to be noted that by an order
dated 30.09.2018, an investigation was directed to be conducted by the SFIO into IL&FS and its
subsidiaries, which comprise of approximately 100-160 entities. So far as the IFIN is concerned, it
was one of the subsidiaries in the IL&FS group and the financial services arm. It is the case on behalf
of the Central Government that so far as Criminal Appeal Nos.2305-2307/2022 Etc.
the SFIO IFIN Report is concerned, it is a record in respect of IFIN, upon completion of
investigation into IFIN. Merely because so far as the investigation with respect to other subsidiary
companies of IL&FS group is concerned, the same might have been going on, cannot be a ground to
observe that at this stage so far as the IFIN is concerned the report was incomplete report and for
which the investigation was going on. The High Court has not properly appreciated the aforesaid
and has wrongly treated the report as an interim report so far as the IFIN is concerned. At this stage,
it is required to be noted that in the SFIO IFIN Report itself, it is observed that in light of complex
structure of the IL&FS Group and the inter- linkages between entities etc, if any further instances or
transactions are uncovered qua IFIN during the investigation of other group companies of IL&FS,
then a further report will be filed. Therefore, the High Court has materially erred that the
investigation in respect of IFIN is incomplete. It is required to be noted that as such the SFIO had
submitted the report after a detailed and extensive investigation of IFIN. There are conclusive
findings against each of the writ petitioners including Hari Sankaran pointing out multiple breaches,
violations of Criminal Appeal Nos.2305-2307/2022 Etc.
statutory duties and fraudulent conduct. We are not elaborating the same in detail as the
prosecution is yet to take place and the concerned persons are to be tried. The proceedings before
the High Court were at the stage of direction under section 212(14) to allow the prosecution and the
sanction to prosecute. Ample opportunity shall be available to the concerned accused against whom
the prosecution was ordered for the offences punishable under section 447 of the Companies Act
and other relevant provisions of the IPC. Therefore, the High Court has erred in setting aside the
direction under section 212(14) to prosecute at this stage and on the aforesaid grounds.

Conclusion:
16. In view of the above and for the reasons stated above, challenge to the constitutional validity of
section 140(5) of the Companies Act, 2013 fails and it is observed and held that section 140(5) is
neither discriminatory, arbitrary and/or violative of Articles 14, 19(1)(g) of the Constitution of India,
as alleged. The impugned judgment and order passed by the High Court quashing and setting aside
the application/proceedings under section 140(5) on Criminal Appeal Nos.2305-2307/2022 Etc.
the ground that as the auditors have resigned and therefore thereafter the same is not maintainable
is hereby quashed and set aside. Consequently, the impugned judgment and order passed by the
High Court quashing and setting aside the NCLT order holding that even after the resignation of the
auditors, the proceedings under section 140(5) shall be maintainable is hereby quashed and set
aside. The application/proceedings under section 140(5) of the Act, 2013 is held to be maintainable
even after the resignation of the concerned auditors and now the NCLT therefore to pass a final
order on such application after holding enquiry in accordance with law and thereafter on the basis of
such final order, further consequences as provided under the second proviso to section 140(5) shall
follow. However, it is made clear that we have not expressed anything on merits on the allegations
against the concerned auditors and it is ultimately for the NCLT/Tribunal to pass a final order on
the application filed by the Central Government under section 140(5) of the Act, 2013.
17. In view of the above and for the reasons stated above, the impugned judgment and order passed
by the High Court quashing and setting aside the direction under Criminal Appeal
Nos.2305-2307/2022 Etc.
Section 212(14) of the Companies Act, 2013 dated 29.05.2019 issued by the Union of India to SFIO
is hereby quashed and set aside. The impugned judgment and order passed by the High Court
quashing and setting aside the prosecution lodged by the SFIO vide Criminal Complaint CC
No.20/2019 on the file of Special Court (Companies Act) and Additional Sessions Judge, Greater
Mumbai is also hereby quashed and set aside. Now the said Criminal Complaint CC No. 20/2019 be
proceeded further by the concerned Trial Court in accordance with law and on its own merits.
18. Accordingly, in view of the above, the appeals filed by the Union of India, viz., Criminal Appeal
Nos. 2305- 2307/2022; 2302-2303/2022; and 2300/2022 are allowed and Criminal Appeal Nos.
2298/2022, 2299/2022 and 2304/2022, as also, Civil Appeal Nos.793/2022; 801/2022 and
877/2022 filed by the Deloitte and its partners are hereby dismissed.
