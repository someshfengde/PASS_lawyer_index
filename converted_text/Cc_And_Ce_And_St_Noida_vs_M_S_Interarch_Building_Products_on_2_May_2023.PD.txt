1. Feeling aggrieved and dissatisfied with the Signature Not Verified Digitally signed by R Natarajan
Date: 2023.05.02 impugned judgment and order dated 16:43:17 IST Reason:
Civil Appeal No.11330 of 2018 09.11.2017 passed by the Customs, Excise and Service
Tax Appellate Tribunal, Regional Bench at Allahabad (hereinafter referred to as ‘the
Appellate Tribunal’) by which the learned Tribunal has allowed the said appeal
preferred by the respondent and has set aside the Order−  in− Original dated
31.03.2017 disallowing the CENVAT Credit, the Revenue has preferred the present
appeal.
2. The facts leading to the present appeal in nutshell are as under:
2.1 The respondent – assessee was engaged in the business of manufacture, supply and erection at
the site of prefabricated/pre− engineered steel buildings and parts thereof classifiable under Civil

Appeal No.11330 of 2018 the relevant Headings/sub− headings of the First Schedule to the Central
Excise Tariff Act, 1985. The respondent was having centralized registration for Service Tax with the
Service Tax Department for services under "Commercial or Industrial Construction Service" and
"Construction Services" right from the commencement of production. The goods manufactured were
cleared from the place of manufacture on payment of central excise duty on which CENVAT Credit
was made by the respondent. The unit at Greater Noida registered as a Centralized Service Provider,
availed CENVAT Credit
(i) Excise duty paid by the units at the time of removal
(ii) duty paid on capital goods Civil Appeal No.11330 of 2018
(iii) service tax paid on input services. They paid service tax on the gross amount of contract for
engineering, procurements supply, construction, erection etc. under the category "commercial or
industrial constructions services" as referred under Section 65(105)(zzq) of the Finance Act, 1994
(hereinafter referred to as ‘the Act, 1994’).
2.2 Based on specific intelligence that the respondent had wrongly classified the services rendered
by them, availed inadmissible CENVAT Credit and short paid the Service Tax in cash. Department
was of the view that the services rendered by the respondent amounted to Works Contract which
were chargeable to tax under sub clause [zzzza] of Section 65(105] Civil Appeal No.11330 of 2018 of
the Finance Act, 1994. Therefore, according to the Revenue on classifiable service under ‘works
contract service’ the respondents availed CENVAT Credit on Central Excise duty paid on inputs.
2.3 Therefore, the Department issued a Show Cause Notice alleging inter alia that the respondent
had utilized CENVAT Credit of Rs.1,12,60,92,760/−  on building material during June, 2007 to
March, 2012 which was inadmissible. It was alleged that the said amount had been recovered as
service tax from the customer under Section 73(1) of the Act, 1994. It appeared to the Revenue that
services should have been classified under “Works Civil Appeal No.11330 of 2018 Contract Service”.
It was mandatory for the respondent to either follow Rule 2A of Service Tax (Determination of
Value) Rules, 2006 or adopt Composition Scheme. The said Rule 2A and Composition Scheme do
not allow the availment of CENVAT Credit on input. Therefore, it appeared to the Revenue that the
CENVAT Credit of Rs.112,60,92,760/−  as availed on input was inadmissible and therefore, the said
debit has resulted in short payment of Service Tax.
2.4 The Show Cause Notice was related to the period from June, 2007 to March, 2012. The
respondent was called upon to show cause as to why the services being provided by them be Civil
Appeal No.11330 of 2018 reclassified under "Works Contract Service" in place of "Commercial or
Industrial Construction Services", inadmissible CENVAT Credit of building material amounting to
Rs.112,60,92,760/−  be disallowed in terms of Rules 2 & 3(1) of CENVAT Credit Rules, 2004; an
amount of Rs.22,37,01,811/−  on account of short paid Service Tax towards the liability debited from
the inadmissible Cenvat Credit on construction materials be recovered under Section 73(1) of the
Act, 1994; an amount of Rs.90,23,90,907/−  alleged to have been collected as cash in excess of the
Service Tax assessed/determined by passing the inadmissible CENVAT Credit to their recipients of

taxable service be demanded under Section Civil Appeal No.11330 of 2018 73A of the Act, 1994
along with the appropriate rate of interest under Sections 73B and 75 of the Act and the penalties be
imposed under Sections 77 & 75 of the Act, 1994 read with Rule 15(3) of CENVAT Credit Rules,
2004. By Order dated 28.03.2004 the Adjudicating Authority who disallowed the CENVAT Credit
amounting to Rs.1,12,60,92,760/−  confirmed the amounts of Rs.22,37,01,811/−  being short paid,
confirmed the claim in the show cause notice.
2.5 The department had issued further Show Cause Notices/statement of demands for the
subsequent period also.
Civil Appeal No.11330 of 2018 2.6 By order dated 18.11.2015, the learned Tribunal set aside the
adjudication order and remanded the matter back to the adjudicating authority with the direction
that the tax liability be re− determined after hearing the respondent.
On remand the adjudicating authority passed a fresh order dated 31.03.2017 and confirmed the
demands. The Commissioner held that the services rendered by the respondent was classifiable as
‘Works Contract Service’ and rejected the availability of CENVAT Credit amount and directed
recovery under Section 73A of the Act, 1994. The Order− in−  Original passed by the adjudicating
authority was the subject matter of the present appeal before the Tribunal.
Civil Appeal No.11330 of 2018 2.7 Before the Tribunal the Order− in− Original passed by the
Adjudicating Authority was challenged on the following grounds:
(i) “The Id. Commissioner disallowed Cenvat credit availed on inputs in terms of Rule 2 & 3(1) of
Cenvat Credit Rules, 2004 to the extent of Rs.1,12,60,92,760/−  in case of show cause notice dated
23.10.2012 and the amounts in case other 3 notices as specified above and that such order is not
sustainable in law.
(ii) The provision of Rule 2A of Service Tax (Determination of Value) Rules, 2006, start with
expression "subject to the provisions of Section 67" which means the provision prescribed under
said Rule 2A, is subject to the provisions of Section 67 of the Finance Act, 1994.
(iii) Opening Para of Rule 3 of Composition Scheme reads as−  "Notwithstanding anything contained
in Section 67 of the Act and Rule 2A of the Service Tax (Determination of Value) Rules, 2006, the
person liable to pay Service Tax in relation to Works Contract Service shall have the option to
discharge his Service Tax liability on the Works Contract Service." It clearly indicates that it is one of
the options given Civil Appeal No.11330 of 2018 to the Service Provider to discharge Service Tax
liability in respect of Works Contract Service and it is not mandatory to adopt the said Rule under
Composition Scheme for discharge of Service Tax liability.
(iv) Section 67 of the Finance Act, 1994 provides for arriving at assessable value which states
"subject to the provisions of this Chapter, where Service Tax is chargeable on any taxable service
with reference to its value, then such value shall in a case where the provision of service is for a
consideration in money, be the gross amount charged by the service provider for such service

provided or to be provide by him." Therefore, the said provision which is fundamental in nature and
is applicable to any taxable service.
(v) The demand towards Cenvat credit confirmed in case of show cause notice dated 23.10.2012 is
substantially time barred.
(vi) In the impugned order, Id. Commissioner has distinguished the judgment of this Tribunal in the
case of S.V. Jiwani (supra) and the grounds on which Id, Commissioner distinguished the judgment
are invalid.” Civil Appeal No.11330 of 2018 2.8 By the impugned judgment and order the learned
Tribunal has allowed the appeal preferred by the respondent and has set aside the Order− in−
Original passed by the adjudicating authority by observing that the composition scheme is optional
and the provisions of Rule 2A of the said Rules are subject to provisions of Section 67 of the Act,
1994. The learned Tribunal has also observed that it is clear from the provisions of sub−  section 4 of
Section 67 of the Act, that where value cannot be determined as provided under sub− rule (1) to (3)
of Section 67 of the Act, then only the value is to be determined as provided under the Rules.
Therefore, the Tribunal held that there is no question on applicability of Civil Appeal No.11330 of
2018 Rule 2A nor there was any question of forcibly applying the option of Composition Scheme.
The learned Tribunal held that in both these circumstances, the respondent was entitled to CENVAT
Credit on inputs.
2.9 Feeling aggrieved and dissatisfied with the impugned judgment and order passed by the learned
Tribunal setting aside the Order− in−  Original, the Revenue has preferred the present appeal.
3. Shri N. Venkataraman, learned ASG has appeared on behalf of the Revenue and Shri V.
Raghuraman, learned Senior Counsel has appeared on behalf of the respondent – assessee.
Civil Appeal No.11330 of 2018
4. Shri N. Venkataraman, learned ASG appearing on behalf of the Revenue has made the following
submissions challenging the correctness and legality of the impugned order passed by the CESTAT:
(i) That the period under dispute is January, 2007 to March, 2014. He has submitted that the
definition of ‘works contract service’ was brought into the Finance Act, 1994 w.e.f. 01.06.2007.
Therefore, he has fairly conceded the demand for the period January, 2007 to 31.05.2007 shall not
be maintainable in light of the decision of this Court in the case of Commissioner of Central Excise
vs. Larsen and Toubro, (2016) 1 SCC 170 as well as Civil Appeal No.11330 of 2018 Total
Environment Building Systems Pvt. Ltd. vs. Deputy Commissioner of Commercial Taxes, (2022)
SCC Online SC 953.
4.1 It is submitted that therefore the demand for the period January, 2007 to May, 2007 is not
sustainable and therefore to that extent the demand should go.
4.2 It is submitted that however, for the period commencing 01.06.2007 to 31.03.2014 the demands
are sustainable and the Orders− in−  Original need to be restored.

composite works contract Civil Appeal No.11330 of 2018 is vivisected and, − (i)
VAT/sales tax is leviable on transfer of property in goods involved in the execution of

value of services is to be determined by vivisecting the composite works contract.
Rule 2A of Service Tax (Determination of Value) Rules, 2006 [Notification

service shall be equivalent to the gross amount charged for the works contract less

property in goods involved in the execution of works contract.
Civil Appeal No.11330 of 2018 9.3 Wherever VAT/sales tax on transfer of property in goods involved

Court observed in para 47 in the case of Gannon Dunkerly and Co. (supra) as under:
“47. ….. The value of the goods involved in the execution of a works contract will, therefore, have to
be determined by taking into account the value of the entire works contract and deducting
therefrom the charges towards labour and services which would cover—
(a) Labour charges for execution of the works;
(b) amount paid to a sub− contractor for labour and services;
(c) charges for planning, designing and architect's fees;
(d) charges for obtaining on hire or otherwise machinery and tools used for the execution of the
works contract; Civil Appeal No.11330 of 2018

contract the property in which is not transferred in the course of execution of a works contract; and
(f) cost of establishment of the contractor to the extent it is relatable to supply of labour and
services;
(g) other similar expenses relatable to supply of labour and services;
(h) profit earned by the contractor to the extent it is relatable to supply of labour and services.
The amounts deductible under these heads will have to be determined in the light of the facts of a
particular case on the basis of the material produced by the contractor.” 4.12 It is submitted that the
above service elements have found a statutory recognition as the same stood incorporated as part of
Rule 2A of the Service Tax (Determination of Value) Rules, 2006 w.e.f. 01.06.2007.

Civil Appeal No.11330 of 2018 4.13 It is submitted that consequently this Court while dealing with
the decision of Larsen and Toubro (supra) had specifically addressed this issue by bringing the
similarity of the service elements as mentioned in Constitution Bench’s decision in Gannon
Dunkerly (supra) and framed as Rule 2A of the Valuation Rules, 2006. Reliance is placed on paras
25 and 26 of the said judgment.

for reconsideration in the batch of matter in the case of Total Environment Building Systems Pvt.
Ltd. (supra) wherein this Court vide para 28 rejected the request to refer the Civil Appeal No.11330
of 2018 matter to the larger Bench by observing in paragraph 28 which reads as under:
“28. While appreciating the prayer/submission made on behalf of the Revenue to re− consider the
binding decision of this Court in the case of Larsen and Toubro Limited (supra) and to refer the
matter to the Larger Bench, few facts are required to be taken into consideration, which are as
under:—

delivered/passed in the year 2015, in which, it is specifically observed and held that on indivisible
works contracts for the period pre− Finance Act, 2007, the service tax was not leviable;
(ii) After considering the entire scheme and the levy of service tax pre− Finance Act, 2007 and after
giving cogent reasons, a conscious decision has been taken by this Court holding that the service tax
was not leviable pre− Finance Act, 2007 on indivisible/Composite Works Contracts;
(iii) While holding that for the period pre−  Finance Act, 2007, on indivisible/Composite Works
Contracts, the service tax is not leviable, number of decisions have been dealt with and Civil Appeal
No.11330 of 2018 considered by this Court in the aforesaid decision;
(iv) That subsequently, the decision of this court in the case of Larsen and Toubro Limited (supra)
has been followed and considered by this Court in the case of Commissioner of Service Tax and Ors.
Bhayana Builders Pvt. Ld. And Ors, (2018) 3 SCC 782,;
(v) That after the decision of this Court in the case of Larsen and Toubro Limited (supra) rendered
in the year 2015, the said decision has been consistently followed by various High Courts and the
Tribunals;
(vi) The decisions of the various High Courts and the Tribunals, which were passed after following
the decision of this Court in the case of Larsen and Toubro Limited (supra) have attained finality
and in many cases, the Revenue has not challenged the said decisions;
(vii) No efforts were made by the Revenue to file any review application to review and/or recall the
judgment and order passed by this Court in the case of Larsen and Toubro Limited (supra). If the
Revenue was so serious in their view that decision of this Court in the case of Larsen and Toubro
Limited (supra) requires re−  consideration, Revenue ought to have filed Civil Appeal No.11330 of

2018 the review application at that stage and/or even thereafter. No such review application has
been filed even as on today.
(viii) Merely because in the subsequent cases, the amount of tax involved may be higher, cannot be a
ground to pray for reconsideration of the earlier binding decision, which has been consistently
followed by various High Courts and the Tribunals in the entire country.” 4.15 It is submitted that
therefore what is taxed under Section 65(105)(zzzza) which later became Section 66E(h) of the
Finance Act, 1994 is the service portion in the execution of works contract. That Section 67(1) makes
it abundantly clear that service tax is chargeable only on the taxable service with reference to its
value. It is submitted that this Court in the case of Larsen and Toubro (supra) as reiterated in Total
Environment Building Civil Appeal No.11330 of 2018 (supra) has made it clear that the goods value
in the nature of transfer of property of goods would suffer sales tax/VAT and the service
components or elements would suffer service tax w.e.f. 01.06.2007 by virtue of the definition of
taxable service under Section 65(105)(zzzza) and later as Section 66E(h) as a declared service post
01.07.2012.
4.16 It is submitted that the incorporation of taxable service w.e.f. 01.06.2007 also resulted in the
introduction of Rule 2A in the Valuation Rules, 2006 clearly identifying the service elements or
components which would constitute the value for determination and payment of service tax. These
components again were retained even Civil Appeal No.11330 of 2018 after the insertion of Section
66E(h) post 01.07.2012.
4.17 It is submitted that this Court in the case of Larsen and Toubro (supra) vide para 25 had
referred to Rule 2A of the Valuation Rules, 2006 and its purport by holding that the said Rule goes
on to say that the service component of the works contract is to include the 8 elements laid down in
the second Gannon Dunkerly’s case and the value attributable to the service in the works contract
would be the service elements in such contracts as this scheme alone would comply with the
constitutional requirements as it seeks to bifurcate a composite indivisible works contract Civil
Appeal No.11330 of 2018 and takes care to see that no element is attributable to the property in
goods transferred pursuant to such contract enters into the computation of the service tax. It is
submitted that therefore the purport of Rule 2A of the valuation rules is only to bring the elements
of service tax as that alone would meet the constitutional requirements and no elements attributable
to the property in goods should enter in the computation of service tax. It is, therefore, the entire
contention of the respondent −  assessee that they have a legal right to pay tax even on the goods
portion as service tax and also take input credit on the duty paid on the goods is clearly contrary to
para 25 of the Larsen and Toubro (supra) Civil Appeal No.11330 of 2018 judgment and Rule 2A of
the Valuation Rules, 2006.
4.18 Now so far as the composition scheme is concerned, it is submitted that the assessee falling
under the definition of ‘works contract service’ from 01.06.2007 has to discharge service tax liability
either under Rule 2A of the valuation rules only on the service components without taking any
CENVAT Credit on the input goods or go for the option of a composition scheme in which case the
rates of tax specified at various points of time should have been complied with on the total contract
value. It is submitted that the invented method of the respondent – assessee by seeking to pay

11
service tax on entire contract Civil Appeal No.11330 of 2018 value after taking the CENVAT Credit
on the input goods is clearly unsustainable in law. The contention that Rule 2A is subject to Section
67 which according to the respondent – assessee permits payment of tax on the contract value
including the goods runs counter to the scheme of works contract service. It is submitted that the
what would constitute as goods under Article 366 (29A)(b) of the Constitution cannot be construed
as a taxable service and as a value of taxable service.
4.19 It is submitted that Finance Act, 1994 read with the Rules permit only 2 options either to pay
service tax on the service elements as Civil Appeal No.11330 of 2018 envisaged under Rule 2A of the
Valuation Rules, 2006 without taking the CENVAT Credit on input goods or opt for composition. It
is submitted that the third variant of paying service tax on the total contract value including goods
and correspondingly availing CENVAT Credit on the input is not only misconceived but also legally
untenable besides a Constitutional bar.
4.20 Now so far as the reliance is placed upon the decision of this Court in the case of Commissioner
of Service Tax and Ors. Bhayana Builders Pvt. Ld. and Ors, (2018) 3 SCC 782 is concerned, it is
submitted that on facts it has no relevance. It is submitted that Civil Appeal No.11330 of 2018 on the
contrary the decision of this Court in the case of Larsen and Toubro (supra) would apply. It is
submitted that even the circular dated 22.05.2005 makes it amply clear as to how a works contract
service needs to be taxed and vide para 9.2 referred to Rule 2A of the Valuation Rules, 2006 to
affirm that the value of works contract service shall be equivalent to the gross amount charged for
the works contract less the value of transfer of property in goods involved in the execution of the
said contract and vide para 9.3 rings out the elements of services which matches exactly with the
elements laid down by this Court in the case of Gannon Dunkerly (supra). Civil Appeal No.11330 of
2018
5. Making above submissions it is prayed to allow the present appeal.
6. Present appeal is vehemently opposed by Shri V. Raghuraman, learned Senior Counsel appearing
on behalf of the respondent – assessee.
6.1 While opposing the present appeal and in support of the impugned order passed by the CESTAT,
learned counsel appearing on behalf of the respondent has made the following submissions:
(i) That the composition scheme is optional as per Rule 3(1) of the Composition Rules;
(ii) Provisions of Rule 2A of the Valuation Rules are subject to the provisions of Section 67 of the
Finance Act, 1994;
(iii) Once the provisions of Section 67 of the Finance Act, 1994 have been complied Civil Appeal
No.11330 of 2018 with, neither the question of applicability of Rule 2A of the Valuation Rules arise
nor was there any question of forcibly applying option of Composition Scheme on the assessee;

12
(iv) Even if the services of the respondent are considered as classifiable under ‘works contract
service’ after 1st June, 2007, as claimed by the Revenue, the further claims of the Revenue that there
were only two options as above for valuation of the works contract service namely the composition
rules and the Rule 2A of the Valuation Rules available to the assessee and consequential non−
admissibility of CENVAT Credit has no merit.
Civil Appeal No.11330 of 2018
(v) It is submitted that in case of ‘works contract service’ also, the assessment can be done under the
provisions of Section 67 of the Finance Act, 1994 and that valuation methods prescribed under Rule
2A or composition scheme are merely options provided to the assessee;
(vi) Therefore, the benefit of CENVAT Credit on inputs cannot be denied to the respondents in
absence of any specific bar or prohibition in the CENVAT Credit Rules, 2004 or the Finance Act,
1994. 6.2 It is further submitted by learned counsel appearing on behalf of the respondent that while
passing the impugned order the learned Tribunal has rightly followed its earlier decision Civil
Appeal No.11330 of 2018 in the case of CCE vs. S.V. Jiwani, 2014 (35) STR 351 affirmed by the
Bombay High Court which is squarely applicable. It is submitted that in the said case it was held
that the composition rules and Rule 2A of the Valuation Rules are merely options provided to the
service provider to discharge of service tax liability vis− à− vis options available in Section 67 of the
Finance Act, 1994.
6.3 It is further submitted that Rule 2A of the Valuation Rules begins with the words ‘subject to
provisions of Section 67’. It is submitted that this would mean that Rule 2A would apply only when
value of the service involved in execution of the works contract could not be determined under
Section 67 of the Act. Civil Appeal No.11330 of 2018 6.4 It is further submitted by learned counsel
appearing on behalf of the respondent – assessee that prior to 01.07.2012 the assessee had three
options:
(i) Follow the tenets of Section 67 and pay tax on the full value and take input tax credit.
(ii) Rule 2A of the Valuation Rules: to pay service tax at the full applicable rate on the taxable value
as determined in terms of Rule 2A of the Valuation Rules. No bar to avail CENVAT Credit on inputs.
(iii) Composition Rules: To pay service tax @ 2.06% (increased to 4.12% w.e.f. 01.03.2008) on the
gross amount charged for the Contract, in terms of the Composition Rules. Cenvat credit on inputs
would be inadmissible.
Civil Appeal No.11330 of 2018 6.5 After 01.07.2012 the assessee had three options:
(i) Follow the tenets of Section 67 and pay tax on the full value and take input tax credit.
(ii) Rule 2A(i): To determine the taxable value of service after deducting the actual value of the
material involved.
Cc And Ce And St Noida vs M/S Interarch Building Products ... on 2 May, 2023
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/164960002/
13
(iii) Rule 2(ii): To pay service tax on specified percentage of the total amount charged for the works
contract.
6.6 It is submitted therefore under the above scheme the assessee had the option to pay the service
tax at full value on the entire amount charged towards providing construction service Civil Appeal
No.11330 of 2018 or works contract services under the provisions of Section 67 of the Finance Act,
1994. 6.7 It is submitted that in this case the assessee would be eligible to full CENVAT Credit and
input, input services and capital goods under CENVAT Credit Rules, 2004 OR to pay service tax
under the head construction services by opting for abatements specified in Notification under
15/2004 – HT, as amended from time to time or replaced with new notification; OR to pay service
tax under the head ‘works contract services’ either in terms of Rule 2A of the Valuation Rules or in
terms of the Composition Rules.
6.8 It is further submitted that the words used in Rule 2A ‘subject to Section 67’ conveys the Civil
Appeal No.11330 of 2018 clear idea that the valuation done under Section 67 is supreme and the
rules are subject to the Act.
6.9 It is submitted that therefore the composition rules are completely optional for the assessee to
exercise the assessee can opt for Section 67. 6.10 It is submitted that taking CENVAT duty on inputs
is barred only if one opts for Composition Rules and not if tax is paid at normal prevailing rates on
full gross value of contract under Section 67.
6.11 It is further prayed on behalf of the respondent that in case the appeal be allowed on merits, the
Tribunal has not rendered any finding on extended period of limitation and/or other issues and
therefore the matters may be remanded back to the Tribunal.
Civil Appeal No.11330 of 2018 7 Heard learned counsel for the respective parties at length.
8 The short question which is posed for consideration before this Court is as to whether an assessee
who is liable to pay service tax under works contract service has the legal right not to follow Rule 2A
of the Service Tax (Determination of Value) Rules, 2006 nor the Composition Scheme on the ground
that in terms of Section 67 of the Finance Act, 1994 an assessee is entitled to take the total contract
value which includes both goods and services and remit service tax on the entire value as works
contract service and in the process also entitled to avail the CENVAT Credit? 8.1 At the outset, it is
required to be noted that as such services rendered by the respondent – Civil Appeal No.11330 of
2018 assessee can be said to be ‘works contract service’ as per the Finance Act, 1994 w.e.f.
01.06.2007 as per Section 64(54) read with Section 65(105)(zzzza).
8.2 As per the law laid down by this Court in the case of Larsen and Toubro (supra) and Gannon
Dunkerly and Co. (supra) and the subsequent decision in the case of Total Environment Building
Systems Pvt. Ltd. (supra) with respect to the works contract an assessee is liable to sales tax on the
goods element and the service tax on the availment of service/value of service rendered. 8.3 In the
case of Gannon Dunkerly and Co.

(supra) while dealing with measure of tax in Civil Appeal No.11330 of 2018 para 47 this Court had
provided a list of exclusions from the cost of valuation of goods and as to what would constitute the
service elements. As per the law laid down by this Court in the aforesaid decision the following are
to be excluded from the cost of valuation of the goods.
“47. ….. The value of the goods involved in the execution of a works contract will, therefore, have to
be determined by taking into account the value of the entire works contract and deducting
therefrom the charges towards labour and services which would cover—
(a) Labour charges for execution of the works;
(b) amount paid to a sub− contractor for labour and services;
(c) charges for planning, designing and architect's fees;
(d) charges for obtaining on hire or otherwise machinery and tools used for the execution of the
works contract;
(e) cost of consumables such as water, electricity, fuel, etc. used in the Civil Appeal No.11330 of 2018
execution of the works contract the property in which is not transferred in the course of execution of
a works contract; and
(f) cost of establishment of the contractor to the extent it is relatable to supply of labour and
services;
(g) other similar expenses relatable to supply of labour and services;
(h) profit earned by the contractor to the extent it is relatable to supply of labour and services.
The amounts deductible under these heads will have to be determined in the light of the facts of a
particular case on the basis of the material produced by the contractor.” 8.4 It is required to be
noted that thereafter the above service elements have found a statutory recognition as part of Rule
2A of the Service Tax (Determination of Value) Rules, 2006 w.e.f. 01.06.2007 which has been
referred to hereinabove. The applicability of Rule 2A has been dealt with and considered by this
Court in extenso in the case of Larsen and Toubro (supra). Civil Appeal No.11330 of 2018 Therefore,
as per the law laid down by this Court in the case of ‘works contract service’ an assessee is liable to
pay the service tax on the service element/value of the service rendered and the sales tax/tax on the
element of goods transferred pursuant to the contract. 8.5 In light of the above now the next main
question posed for consideration before this Court is required to be considered namely whether
despite Rule 2A of the Service Tax (Determination of Value) Rules, 2006 and the Composite Scheme
still the assessee is entitled to take the total contract value which includes both goods and services in
terms of Section 67 of the Act, 1994 and remit service tax on the entire value as works contract
service and the Civil Appeal No.11330 of 2018 assessee is also entitled to avail CENVAT Credit?

8.6 Rule 2A applicable prior to 01.07.2012 is reproduced hereinabove. It is to be noted that Rule 2A
is the specific provision for determination of value of taxable service in relation to services involved
in the execution of a works contact shall be determined by the service provider in the manner
provided under Rule 2A(1)(i) i.e. value of works contract service determined shall be equivalent to
the gross amount charged for the works contract. As per explanation to Rule 2A gross amount
charged for the works contract shall not include Value Added Tax (VAT) or sales tax, as the case may
be, paid, if any, on transfer of property in goods Civil Appeal No.11330 of 2018 involved in the
execution of the works contract. The position is made more clear post 01.07.2012. Post 01.07.2012
as per Rule 2A value of service portion in the execution of a works contract shall be determined
taking into consideration the value of service portion in the execution of a works contract equivalent
to the gross amount charged for the works contract less the value of property of goods transferred in
the execution of the said works contract. Therefore, as such the things which were already there as
per the decision of this Court in the case of Gannon Dunkerly and Co. (supra) and Rule 2A earlier
has been made explicitly clear.
Civil Appeal No.11330 of 2018 8.7 However, as per the Composition Scheme vide notification
32/2007 – ST dated 22.04.2007 by which works contract (Composition Scheme for payment of
Service Tax) Rules, 2007 came to be introduced, as per Rule 3(1) and notwithstanding anything
contained in Section 67 of the Act and Rule 2A of the Rules, 2006, the person liable to pay service
tax in relation to works contract service shall have the option to discharge the service tax at the rate
specified in Section 67 of the Act, by paying an amount equivalent to 2% of the gross amount
charged for the works contract. Explanation specifically provides that gross amount charged for the
works contract shall not include the VAT or sales tax, as the case may be paid on transfer Civil
Appeal No.11330 of 2018 of property in goods involved in the execution of the said works contract.
At this stage, it is required to be noted that post 01.07.2012 Rule 2A specifically provides that the
taxable service shall not take CENVAT Credit of duty or cess paid on inputs used in or in relation to
said works contract, under the provisions of CENVAT Credit Rules, 2004.
8.8 It is the case on behalf of the respondent – assessee that as in Rule 2A and even in the
Composition Scheme the word used are subject to the provisions of Section 67 the assessee had an
option to pay the service tax on the entire contract value i.e. on gross amount charged by the service
provider and that Rule 2A is not compulsory and the Composition Civil Appeal No.11330 of 2018
Scheme is optional. However, the aforesaid has no substance. If the submission on behalf of the
assessee is accepted in that case Rule 2A and the Composition Scheme shall become otiose.
8.9 With respect to the ‘works contract service’ and/or the Composition Works Contract the
valuation has to be made as per Rule 2A of the Valuation Rules, 2006. Even as per the Composition
Scheme vide Notification 32/2007 dated 22.04.2007 an assessee has an option to discharge the
service tax liability on the works contract service provided or to be provided, instead of paying
service tax at the rate specified in Section 66 of the Act by paying equivalent to 2% of the gross
amount charged Civil Appeal No.11330 of 2018 for the works contract. It is to be noted that Rule
3(1) provides notwithstanding anything contained in Section 67 of the Act and Rule 2A of the
Service (Determination of Value) Rules, 2006. Therefore, as per the Scheme of the Act the
determination of value of service portion in the execution of the works contract is to be made as per
Cc And Ce And St Noida vs M/S Interarch Building Products ... on 2 May, 2023
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/164960002/
16
Rule 2A, however with an option to the assessee to avail the benefit of Composition Scheme.
Therefore, either the assessee has to go for Composition Scheme or go for Determination of Value as
per Rule 2A and the assessee has to pay service tax on the service element and can claim CENVAT
Credit on the said amount only.
Civil Appeal No.11330 of 2018 9 In view of the above the impugned judgment and order passed by
the CESTAT taking the contrary view is unsustainable by which it is held that the assessee is entitled
to take the total contract value which includes both goods and services and remit service tax on the
entire value as ‘works contract’ and the assessee is also entitled to avail the CENVAT Credit on the
same.
9.1 However, at the same time the service tax needs to be paid in terms of Rule 2A of Service Tax
(Determination of Value) Rules, 2006 and since the assessee has not opted for composition scheme,
the matter is to be remitted back for re− computation of the demands in terms of Rule 2A. As the
issue Civil Appeal No.11330 of 2018 with respect to the extended period of limitation has also not
been decided by CESTAT the matter is to be remanded to the CESTAT to decide the issue of
limitation. 10 In view of the above and for the reason stated above, the present appeal succeeds. The
impugned judgment and order passed by the CESTAT is hereby quashed and set aside and it is held
that the assessee is not entitled to take the total contract value which includes both goods and
services and remit service tax on the value as works contract service and, in the process, also entitled
to avail the CENVAT Credit on the entire amount. It is observed and held that the assessee has to
pay the service tax on the value of services as per Rule 2A of the (Determination of Value) Rules,
2006 and Civil Appeal No.11330 of 2018 thereafter to avail the CENVAT Credit accordingly.
However, it is also observed and held that demand for the period January 2007 to May 2007 is
unsustainable.
10.1 In that view of the matter now the service tax needs to be computed in terms of Rule 2A of the
(Determination of Value) Rules, 2006 and as the assessee has not opted for the composition
scheme, the matter is remitted back to the CESTAT for re− computation of the demands in terms of
Rule 2A.
As observed hereinabove the Tribunal has also not decided the issue of extended period of
limitation. Therefore, while quashing and setting aside the impugned judgment and order passed by
the CESTAT, the matter is remitted back to the CESTAT limited only to decide the Civil Appeal
No.11330 of 2018 issue of limitation and re− computation of the demands in terms of Rule 2A. The
aforesaid exercise be completed by the CESTAT on remand within a period of three months from the
date of the present order.
Present appeal is accordingly allowed. However, in the facts and circumstances of the case there
shall be no order as to costs.
