M.R. SHAH, J.
1. Feeling aggrieved and dissatisfied with the impugned common judgment and order dated
10.02.2015 passed by the High Court of Judicature at Madras in Writ Petition No. 18872/2011 and
other allied writ petitions, by which the High Court has allowed the said writ petitions Signature Not
Verified Digitally signed by R Natarajan and has quashed G.O. (Ms.) No. 423, Home (Police XI)
Date: 2023.05.04 16:38:35 IST Reason:
Department dated 28.07.2011 (hereinafter referred to as ‘G.O. No. 423 dated 28.07.2011’) as well as
G.O.(Ms.) No. 451, Home (Court III) Department dated 11.08.2011 (hereinafter referred to as ‘G.O.
No. 451 dated 11.08.2011’), the State of Tamil Nadu has preferred the present appeals.
1.1 Criminal Appeal No. 275/2022 has been preferred challenging the impugned order dated
04.11.2020 passed by the High Court of Judicature at Madras in Criminal O.P. No. 23641/2019, by
which the High Court has directed to transfer the case being C.C. No. 2 of 2012 from the Court of
Special Judicial Magistrate, Land Grabbing, Erode to the file of Judicial Magistrate-II, Erode.
2. Vide G.O. No. 423 dated 28.07.2011, the State of Tamil Nadu sanctioned formation of 36 Anti
Land Grabbing Special Cells in Tamil Nadu with one cell each at the State Police Headquarters, 7
Commissionerates and 28 Districts to deal with the Land Grabbing Cases in the State. Consequent
upon the said G.O., another G.O. bearing No. 451 dated 11.08.2011 came to be issued and the Land
Grabbing Cases were ordered to be transferred to the Special Courts which were constituted
exclusively to deal with the Land Grabbing Cases. The aforesaid G.Os were the subject matter of the
writ petitions before the High Court.

2.1 By the impugned common judgment and order, the High Court has set aside G.O. No. 423 dated
28.07.2011 by holding that the same does not lay down any yardstick or guideline to pick and choose
and select particular cases against particular persons said to have indulged in land grabbing and in
the absence of definition of the word/phrase “Land Grabbing”, discretion is vested with the police
personnel attached to the Anti-Land Grabbing Cell to pick and choose against whom they want to
register FIR and proceed with the investigation and on account of the same, the possibility of abuse
and misuse of power cannot be ruled out. While quashing and setting aside G.O. No. 423 dated
28.07.2011, the High Court has also observed that the State Government is at liberty to bring any
appropriate legislation along the lines of the A.P. Land Grabbing (Prohibition) Act, 1982 or better
legislations de hors the result of the writ petitions. Consequently, the High Court has also quashed
and set aside G.O. No. 451 dated 11.08.2011. The impugned common judgment and order passed by
the High Court is the subject matter of present Civil Appeals.
3. Shri R. Shunmugasundaram, learned Advocate General has appeared on behalf of the State of
Tamil Nadu.
3.1 Learned Advocate General appearing for the State of Tamil Nadu has vehemently submitted that
the High Court has erred in quashing the Government Orders by holding that in the absence of
definition pertaining to offence of “Land Grabbing”, the Special Cells constituted for investigating
the cases pertaining to land grabbing are not competent to investigate those kind of cases.
3.2 It is further submitted that the High Court has erred in quashing and setting aside G.O. No. 423
dated 28.07.2011 on the possibility of abuse and misuse of power by the police officers. That the
possibility of abuse or misuse of a provision by the authority cannot be a ground for a legislation to
be held to be arbitrary or violative of Article 14 of the Constitution of India.
3.3 It is next submitted that the High Court has failed to appreciate that the Special Cells were
constituted to deal with the specific problem in the State of Tamil Nadu where large number of
complaints are being filed alleging that goondas by using their muscle power have forcibly occupied
lands.
3.4 It is contended that the High Court ought to have appreciated that the expression “Land
Grabbing” does not need any specific definition as the said expression relates to Sections 447, 420
and 506 of the Indian Penal Code.
4. We have heard learned Advocate General on behalf of the State of Tamil Nadu at length. We have
gone through the common impugned judgment and order passed by the High Court. We have also
gone through G.O. No. 423 dated 28.07.2011, which reads as under:
“HOME (POL-XI) DEPARTMENT G.O.(Ms) No. 423 Dated: 28.07.2011 From the

In the Press Release dated: 10.07.2011, the Hon’ble Chief Minister has made an

Department for inclusion of the expenditure in the supplementary estimates, for bringing it to the
notice of the legislature in due course.

5. By the aforesaid G.O., the Government of Tamil Nadu has constituted/formed 36 Anti Land
Grabbing Special Cells to deal with the land grabbing cases. However, it is required to be noted that
the type of cases can be said to be land grabbing cases has not been defined and/or mentioned in the
said G.O. Therefore, it will be at the discretion of the concerned police officers to treat and/or
consider any case relating to land as land grabbing case, which shall be investigated by the Anti-
Land Grabbing Special Cell, rather than by the police officers under the Cr.P.C. It is required to be
noted that as such there is no Anti-Land Grabbing Act in the State of Tamil Nadu like A.P. Land
Grabbing (Prohibition) Act, 1982 or Karnataka Land Grabbing Prohibition Act, 2011 or similar Land
Grabbing Prohibition Acts in other States. It is required to be noted that in the other Land Grabbing
Prohibition Acts applicable in the States of Andhra Pradesh, Karnataka, Gujarat and Assam, “Land
Grabbing” is specifically defined. Even the term “Land Grabber” is defined. For example, in Andhra
Pradesh Land Grabbing (Prohibition) Act, 1982, “Land Grabber” and “Land Grabbing” are defined
as under:
“land grabber” means a person or a group of persons who commits land grabbing and includes any
person who gives financial aid to any person for taking illegal possession of lands or for construction
of unauthorised structures thereon, or who collects or attempts to collect from any occupiers of such
lands rent, compensation and other charges by criminal intimidation, or who abets the doing of any
of the above mentioned acts; and also includes the successors in interest. “land grabbing” means
every activity of grabbing of any land (whether belonging to the government, a local authority, a
religious or charitable institution or endowment, including a wakf, or any other private person) by a
person or group of persons, without any lawful entitlement and with a view to illegally taking
possession of such lands, or enter into or create illegal tenancies or lease and licences agreements or
any other illegal agreements in respect of such lands, or to construct unauthorised structures
thereon for sale or hire, or give such lands to any person on rental or lease and licence basis for
construction, or use and occupation, of unauthorised structures; and the term “to grab and” shall be
construed accordingly.
6. Insofar as the State of Tamil Nadu is concerned, it is an admitted position that there is no specific
enactment and/or Act to deal with land grabbing cases, like Andhra Pradesh Land Grabbing
(Prohibition) Act, 1982 and the Anti-Land Grabbing Special Cells have been formed by G.O. No. 423
dated 28.07.2011 to exclusively deal with the land grabbing cases. In absence of any guidelines
and/or definition as to which cases can be said to be land grabbing cases, it gives unfettered and
unguided and arbitrary powers to the police to treat any land case as a land grabbing case which will
be investigated by the Anti-
Land Grabbing Special Cell. Even a dispute between two private persons which may be under the
Specific Relief Act and/or Transfer of Property Act may be considered as a land grabbing case like in
Criminal Appeal No. 275/2022 in which a Civil Suit was pending for specific performance which was
dismissed for non-prosecution and thereafter the defendant filed a complaint/FIR for the offences
under the IPC. Therefore, as such, it is rightly held and observed by the High Court that in absence
of any specific guideline and/or definition of “land grabbing cases,” such powers can be abused or
misused and such powers can be said to be exercised arbitrarily. Therefore, the High Court has
rightly set aside G.O. No. 423 dated 28.07.2011 with liberty to the State Government to bring any

appropriate legislation on the lines of A.P. Land Grabbing (Prohibition) Act, 1982 or better
legislations after defining and/or providing the guidelines as to which offences can be said to be
“land grabbing cases”. Therefore, the impugned judgment(s) and order(s) passed by the High Court
does/do not call for any interference by this Court.
7. Under the circumstances, Civil Appeals preferred by the State deserve to be dismissed and are
accordingly dismissed. However, we reiterate that if the State Government is so conscious and/or
interested in taking action against land grabbers, it will be open for the State Government to bring
an appropriate legislation with the clear definition of “land grabber” and “land grabbing” or better
legislations with a clear definition of “land grabbing”, ”land grabber” and “land grabbing cases” and
the present order shall not come in their way to enact such legislation and/or better legislations.
8. In view of the above, Criminal Appeal No. 275/2022 which was with respect to private persons by
which the Criminal case between the parties is ordered to be transferred to the regular Court from
the Special Court (Land Grabbing) deserves to be dismissed and is accordingly dismissed.
