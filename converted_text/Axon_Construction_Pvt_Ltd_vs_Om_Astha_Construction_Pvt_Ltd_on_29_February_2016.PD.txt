Supreme Court of India
Axon Construction Pvt. Ltd vs Om Astha Construction Pvt. Ltd. ... on 29 February, 2016
Bench: J. Chelameswar, Abhay Manohar Sapre
                                                              Non-Reportable
                        IN THE SUPREME COURT OF INDIA
                        CIVIL APPELLATE JURISDICTION
                   SPECIAL LEAVE PETITION (C) NO.5430/2016
      Axon Construction Pvt. Ltd.            Petitioner (s)
                             VERSUS
      Om Astha Construction Pvt. Ltd.
      & Ors.                                  Respondent(s)
                                  O R D E R
1) This SLP is filed by defendant No. 1 of Title Suit No. 789 of 2013 against the order dated
08.12.2015 passed by the Single Judge of the Patna High Court in C.W.J.C. No. 10572 of 2015, which
in turn, arises out of the interim order dated 04.01.2014 passed in Title Suit No. 789 of 2013
pending in the Court of sub-Judge VI, Patna.
2) By impugned order, the High Court declined to entertain the petitioner’s writ petition filed under
Article 227 of the Constitution of India on the ground that the order sought to be impugned in the
writ petition by the petitioner was an appealable order under Order 43 Rule 1 of the Code of Civil
Procedure, 1908 and hence the writ petition is not entertainable to examine the legality and
correctness of the interim order dated 04.01.2014.
3) Learned counsel for the petitioner, at the outset, submitted that it may not be necessary for this
Court to go into the question as to whether the view taken by the High Court while dismissing the
petitioner’s writ petition is correct or not and the petitioner would be satisfied if this Court directs
the trial Court (Sub-Judge VI, Patna) who is seized of the application made by the petitioner under
Section 8 of the Arbitration Act in the aforementioned suit and is also seized of the injunction
application to ensure their expeditious disposal on merits in accordance with law because no orders
one way or other have so far been passed since long causing inconvenience and injury to all parties
concern.
4) In our view, the prayer made by the petitioner is reasonable and accordingly we dispose of this
special leave petition and direct the Sub-Judge VI, Patna to decide the application made under
Section 8 of the Arbitration Act in T.S. No 789 of 2013 and the injunction application on their

respective merit in accordance with law after affording an opportunity to the parties preferably
within 6 weeks from the date of production of this order by the petitioner uninfluenced by any of our
observations.
5) Special Leave Petition stands accordingly disposed of.
