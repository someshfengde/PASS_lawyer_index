SWARANA KANTA SHARMA, J.
1. The instant writ petition has been filed under Article 226 of Constitution of India read with
Section 482 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973 ("Cr.P.C.") for quashing of the proceedings in

2. The present FIR was registered on the complaint of one Mr. Rahul Gupta ("complainant") who
had started a cconsultancy business in the name of „M/sAmbience Home & Developers� in March,
2015 along with one Mr. Surya Kant Goyal. It is alleged that during hawan ceremony of his new
office, he was made to meet one Mr. Abhishek Aggarwal and Mr. Shatrughan, who were introduced
to him by Mr. Surya Kant Goyal. In March 2015 itself, Mr. Abhishek Aggarwal approached the
ccomplainant and requested for a sum of Rs. 15 lakhs on pretext of some urgent need/emergency
and on the assurance of Mr. Surya Kant Goyal, the complainant paid Rs. 15 lakhs to Mr. Abhishek
Aggarwal, and the said amount was then returned to him in June 2015. Thereafter, again in August

2015, Mr. Abhishek Aggarwal and Mr. Shatrughan came to complainant�s office and requested Rs.
25 lakhs. The complainant again paid Rs. 25 lakhs to them and the same was returned to him in
December 2015. It is alleged that in March 2016, Mr. Surya Kant Goyal called the complainant to a
hotel where Mr. Abhishek Aggarwal, his wife Ms. Meenakshi Agarwal and Mr. Shatrughan were
present and the said persons induced the complainant to invest in an upcoming railway project in
Ahmedabad, Gujarat, for which he was asked to pay/invest Rs. 2.5 crores, out of total requirement
of Rs. 10 crores. In order to gain his trust, the aforesaid persons took the complainant to Rail
Bhawan and Parliament House, where he was made to wait outside the premises, and was later
informed by the aforesaid persons that they had met the Railway Minister as well as his PA and that
the Minister concerned had assured them of the allocation of upcoming project in Ahmedabad. It is
alleged that in April 2016, Digitally Signed By:ZEENAT PRAVEEN Signing Date:15.02.2023
15:07:16 NEUTRAL CITATION NO. 2023/DHC/001054 complainant was informed by Mr.
Abhishek Aggarwal that they had been allotted railway project, and he was asked to pay Rs. 20 lakhs
immediately. Upon reaching a hotel, where the aforesaid persons were present, the complainant
handed over Rs. 20 lakhs to Ms. Meenakshi Aggarwal. Further, in June 2016 again, the complainant
was asked to pay Rs. 25 lakhs by Ms. Meenakshi Aggarwal, and the said amount was paid. Again in
December 2016, Rs. 25 lakhs were paid by complainant to Mr. Shatrughan and Mr. Vinod. In a
subsequent meeting which took place in a hotel in March 2017, the complainant was made to meet a
person, who was allegedly the P.A. of Railway Minister, and he was assured that project work was
scheduled to start in November 2017. The complainant was further told by Mr. Shatrughan, a
government employee, that he had seen all the project related documents and that he was himself
investing in the same. Thereafter, in January 2018, the complainant was taken to Ahmedabad by the
aforesaid persons to see the location of railway project, a video of which was also shot by the
complainant. It is further alleged that in February 2018, Ms. Meenakshi Aggarwal and Mr. Abhishek
Aggarwal asked the complainant to arrange Rs. 50 lakhs more, and as per request, the same was
paid by the complainant in cash to them. Again in May 2018, complainant was asked by Mr.
Abhishek Aggarwal to pay Rs. 1 crore, and upon complainant�s request to give something as surety
in return of his money, Mr. Abhishek Aggarwal offered him his flat in Dwarka, Delhi. Thereafter,
some agreements were signed between him and complainant paid Rs. 70 lakhs to Ms. Meenakshi
Aggarwal on 21.05.2018. However, later on, complainant got to know that the said flat did not
belong to Mr. Digitally Signed By:ZEENAT PRAVEEN Signing Date:15.02.2023 15:07:16 NEUTRAL
CITATION NO. 2023/DHC/001054 Abhishek Aggarwal and was owned by someone else. In
January 2019, the complainant demanded back his money, upon which, Mr. Abhishek Aggarwal and
Ms. Meenakshi Aggarwal sought some time and then in April 2019, handed over three-post dated
cheques to him which got dishonored in August 2020 upon presentation. It is alleged that
complainant was thereafter threatened by Mr. Abhishek Aggarwal to not file any complaint with the
authorities against them. The complainant claims to have been duped of Rs. 1.90 crores.
3. Learned counsel for petitioner submits that petitioner, who is a woman, has been falsely
implicated in the present case without there being any role of her in the alleged offence. It is stated
that present FIR is an outburst of some differences between the complainant and the husband of
petitioner, and there is no material evidence, such as money trail through bank accounts, in support
of the allegations leveled by the complainant and entire case is based upon cash transactions. It is
further stated that allegedly, the complainant had made huge cash payments in December 2016 and

February 2017, which is just after the currency notes were demonetized in November 2016.It is also
argued that though the alleged incidents pertain to year 2016/2017, the FIR has been lodged in the
year 2020.
4. Learned APP for the State, on the other hand, invites the attention of this Court to the contents of
FIR and specific allegations leveled therein against the petitioner. It is states that charge sheet in the
present case has also been filed and the case is listed for arguments on charge before the learned
Trial Court. It is further contended by learned APP for State that considering the gravity of the
allegations against the Digitally Signed By:ZEENAT PRAVEEN Signing Date:15.02.2023 15:07:16
NEUTRAL CITATION NO. 2023/DHC/001054 petitioner and other accused persons, the present
petition deserves outright rejection. Learned APP for the State, on instructions from Investigating
Officer, further states that apart from the present FIR, petitioner and her husband are involved in
several other cases of similar nature.
5. I have heard learned counsel for both the parties and have perused the material placed on record.
6. The petitioner by way of present petition, seeks quashing of FIR qua her under Section 482
Cr.P.C. The scope of inherent powersof High Courts under Section 482 of Cr.P.C. has been
elaborated in a catena of judgments by the Hon�ble Apex Court. The guidelines for quashing of
criminal proceedings have been laid down by the Hon�ble Supreme Court in State of Haryana v.
Bhajan Lal 1992 SCC (Crl) 426, which are extracted herein-under for reference:
"102. In the backdrop of the interpretation of the various relevant provisions of the
Code under Chapter XIV and of the principles of law enunciated by this Court in a
series of decisions relating to the exercise of the extra-ordinary power under Article
226 or the inherent powers Under Section 482 of the Code which we have extracted
and reproduced above, we give the following categories of cases by way of illustration
wherein such power could be exercised either to prevent abuse of the process of any
Court or otherwise to secure the ends of justice, though it may not be possible to lay
down any precise, clearly defined and sufficiently channelized and inflexible
guidelines or rigid formulae and to give an exhaustive list of myriad kinds of cases
wherein such power should be exercised.

NO. 2023/DHC/001054
1. Where the allegations made in the First Information Report or the complaint, even if they are
taken at their face value and accepted in their entirety do not prima- facie constitute any offence or
make out a case against the accused.
2. Where the allegations in the First Information Report and other materials, if any, accompanying
the F.I.R. do not disclose a cognizable offence, justifying an investigation by police officers Under
Section 156(1) of the Code except under an order of a Magistrate within the purview of Section
155(2) of the Code.

3. Where the uncontroverted allegations made in the FIR or complaint and the evidence collected in
support of the same do not disclose the commission of any offence and make out a case against the
accused.
4. Where, the allegations in the F.I.R. do not constitute a cognizable offence but constitute only a
non- cognizable offence, no investigation is permitted by a police officer without an order of a
Magistrate as contemplated Under Section 155(2) of the Code.
5. Where the allegations made in the FIR or complaint are so absurd and inherently improbable on
the basis of which no prudent person can ever reach a just conclusion that there is sufficient ground
for proceeding against the accused.
6. Where there is an express legal bar engrafted in any of the provisions of the Code or the
concerned Act (under which a criminal proceeding is instituted) to the institution and continuance
of the proceedings and/or where there is a specific provision in the Code or the concerned Act,
providing efficacious redress for the grievance of the aggrieved party.
7. Where a criminal proceeding is manifestly attended with mala fide and/or where the proceeding
is maliciously instituted with an ulterior motive for Digitally Signed By:ZEENAT PRAVEEN Signing
Date:15.02.2023 15:07:16 NEUTRAL CITATION NO. 2023/DHC/001054 wreaking vengeance on
the accused and with a view to spite him due to private and personal grudge."
103. We also give a note of caution to the effect that the power of quashing a criminal proceeding
should be exercised very sparingly and with circumspection and that too in the rarest of rare cases;
that the court will not be justified in embarking upon an enquiry as to the reliability or genuineness
or otherwise of the allegations made in the FIR or the complaint and that the extraordinary or
inherent powers do not confer an arbitrary jurisdiction on the court to act according to its whim or
caprice..."
7. Recently, the Hon�ble Apex Court in Neeharika Infrastructure v. State of Maharashtra, 2021 SCC
OnLine 315, has analysed the precedents and culled out the relevant principles that govern the law
on quashing of an FIR under Section 482 of the Cr.P.C. It has been held as under:
"...57. From the aforesaid decisions of this Court, right from the decision of the Privy
Council in the case of Khawaja Nazir Ahmad (supra), the following principles of law
emerge:
i) Police has the statutory right and duty under the relevant provisions of the Code of
Criminal Procedure contained in Chapter XIV of the Code to investigate into
cognizable offences;
ii) Courts would not thwart any investigation into the cognizable offences;
Meenakshi Agarwal vs State Of Nct Of Delhi And Anr on 13 February, 2023
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/4273700/

iii) However, in cases where no cognizable offence or offence of any kind is disclosed
in the first information report the Court will not permit an investigation to go on;
Digitally Signed By:ZEENAT PRAVEEN Signing Date:15.02.2023 15:07:16 NEUTRAL CITATION
NO. 2023/DHC/001054
iv) The power of quashing should be exercised sparingly with circumspection, in the „rarest of rare
cases�. (The rarest of rare cases standard in its application for quashing under Section 482 Cr.P.C. is
not to be confused with the norm which has been formulated in the context of the death penalty, as
explained previously by this Court);
v) While examining an FIR/complaint, quashing of which is sought, the court cannot embark upon
an enquiry as to the reliability or genuineness or otherwise of the allegations made in the
FIR/complaint;
vi) Criminal proceedings ought not to be scuttled at the initial stage;
vii) Quashing of a complaint/FIR should be an exception and a rarity than an ordinary rule;
viii) Ordinarily, the courts are barred from usurping the jurisdiction of the police, since the two
organs of the State operate in two specific spheres of activities. The inherent power of the court is,
however, recognised to secure the ends of justice or prevent the above of the process by Section 482
Cr.P.C.
ix) The functions of the judiciary and the police are complementary, not overlapping;
x) Save in exceptional cases where non-interference would result in miscarriage of justice, the Court
and the judicial process should not interfere at the stage of investigation of offences;
xi) Extraordinary and inherent powers of the Court do not confer an arbitrary jurisdiction on the
Court to act according to its whims or caprice;
xii) The first information report is not an encyclopaedia which must disclose all facts and details
relating to the offence reported. Therefore, when the Digitally Signed By:ZEENAT PRAVEEN
Signing Date:15.02.2023 15:07:16 NEUTRAL CITATION NO. 2023/DHC/001054 investigation by
the police is in progress, the court should not go into the merits of the allegations in the FIR. Police
must be permitted to complete the investigation. It would be premature to pronounce the
conclusion based on hazy facts that the complaint/FIR does not deserve to be investigated or that it
amounts to abuse of process of law. During or after investigation, if the investigating officer finds
that there is no substance in the application made by the complainant, the investigating officer may
file an appropriate report/summary before the learned Magistrate which may be considered by the
learned Magistrate in accordance with the known procedure;

xiii) The power under Section 482 Cr.P.C. is very wide, but conferment of wide power requires the
court to be cautious. It casts an onerous and more diligent duty on the court;
xiv) However, at the same time, the court, if it thinks fit, regard being had to the parameters of
quashing and the self-restraint imposed by law, more particularly the parameters laid down by this
Court in the cases of R.P. Kapur (supra) and Bhajan Lal (supra), has the jurisdiction to quash the
FIR/complaint; and xv) When a prayer for quashing the FIR is made by the alleged accused, the
court when it exercises the power under Section 482 Cr.P.C., only has to consider whether or not the
allegations in the FIR disclose the commission of a cognizable offence and is not required to
consider on merits whether the allegations make out a cognizable offence or not and the court has to
permit the investigating agency/police to investigate the allegations in the FIR..."
8. In the present case, the complainant has leveled specific allegations against the petitioner as to
how she was instrumental in Digitally Signed By:ZEENAT PRAVEEN Signing Date:15.02.2023
15:07:16 NEUTRAL CITATION NO. 2023/DHC/001054 inducing the complainant to part away
with his money. It is stated that petitioner had demanded money from the complainant on several
occasions on pretext of same being an investment in an upcoming railway project in Gujarat and the
same was paid to her by the complainant. The Court has perused the contents of FIR where the
entire timeline of the incidents has been submitted by the complainant including the details as to
how the petitioner and her husband/co- accused initially gained the trust of complainant, as well as
the details regarding meetings of the complainant with accused persons in hotels and the role of
each accused person in either inducing him to part away with his money or demanding the money or
receiving the same. Furthermore, there are allegations against the petitioner and her
husband/co-accused in duping the complainant by selling him a property which did not belong to
them and obtaining money for the same. It is also alleged that petitioner had handed over three
post-dated cheques to the complainant which later got dishonored.
9. As informed to this Court, the petitioner is previously involved in two other cases of similar
nature having similar modus operandi for which FIR No. 577/21 at PS Dabri, Delhi under Section
420 IPC, and FIR No. 717/13 at PS Uttam Nagar, Delhi under Section 420/34 IPC was registered
against her. Apart from these, the petitioner�s husband (co-accused in present case) is also involved
in two other cases of similar nature i.e. FIR No. 50/2018 registered at PS Gurugram, Haryana under
Sections 406/420/34 IPC and FIR No. 74/2019 registered at PS EOW, Delhi under Sections
406/420/120B IPC.
Digitally Signed By:ZEENAT PRAVEEN Signing Date:15.02.2023 15:07:16 NEUTRAL CITATION
NO. 2023/DHC/001054
10. It is a settled law that this Court cannot appreciate evidence in a minute manner while
considering a petition filed under Section 482 Cr.P.C. [See Priti Saraf & Anr. v. State of NCT of Delhi
& Anr. 2021 SCC OnLine SC 206], and this Court can neither test veracity of the allegations nor can
it proceed in the manner that a judge conducting a trial is supposed to do on the basis of the
evidence collected during the course of trial [See Mahendra KC v. State of Karnataka (2022) 2 SCC
129]. The inherent power under Section 482 Cr.P.C. has to be exercised only in exceptional cases
Meenakshi Agarwal vs State Of Nct Of Delhi And Anr on 13 February, 2023
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/4273700/
6
and is not to be exercised only for the asking [See Ramveer Upadhyay and Anr. v. State of U.P. and
Anr. 2022 SCC OnLine SC 484].
11. Moreover, neither the allegations leveled against the petitioner by the complainant are entirely
absurd or improbable, nor it is a case where no prima facie offence at all or no cognizable offence is
made out, so as to quash the proceedings within the ambit of principles laid down by the Hon�ble
Apex Court in Bhajan Lal (supra) and Neeharika Infrastructure (supra). No exceptional or rare
circumstances have been shown by petitioner which requires this Court to interfere with the
proceedings at this stage. Since the chargesheet has now been filed in the present case, needless to
say, all the contentions of the petitioner can be raised at the time of arguments on charge, which
shall be dealt with by the learned Trial Court as per law.
12. Thus, considering the allegations against the petitioner herein as well as taking into account her
previous involvement in cases of similar nature, this Court is of the opinion that present case is not a
fit case for quashing of criminal proceedings.

NO. 2023/DHC/001054
13. Accordingly, the present petition stands dismissed.
14. However, it is clarified that no observation made hereinabove by this Court shall have any effect
on the merits of the case during the trial.
15. The judgment be uploaded on the website forthwith.
