3. At the outset, it is necessary for this Court to have a brief background before indulging in
analyzing the issue at hand. On 22.08.2019, Amazon entered into Shareholder and Share−
Subscription Agreements with Future Coupon Private Limited (FCPL). Through these instruments,
Amazon intended to acquire 49% stake in FCPL. The aforesaid agreements contained an arbitration
agreement, wherein parties resolved to settle their disputes in accordance with the Arbitration Rules
of the Singapore International Arbitration Center (SIAC). The parties had further resolved to have
the seats at New Delhi.
4. On 12.08.2019, FCPL and its promoters entered into a Shareholder Agreement with Future Retail
Limited (FRL). Through this Agreement, FCPL was granted certain protective rights. One such right
is produced as under: Clause 10 of SHA:
10. TRANSFER OF RETAIL ASSETS 10.1 As of the Execution Date, the Company has set up an
aggregate of at least 1,534 (one thousand five hundred and thirty four) retail outlets/formats
including without limitation the Small Store formats across India and such retail outlets/stores are
an integral part of the business conducted by the Company representing a significant and
substantial part of the business conducted by the Company. The Existing Shareholders and the
Company further agree, covenant and undertake to FCL that the Company shall be the sole vehicle
for the conduct of such current business comprising of a widespread network of the retail
outlets/formats including without limitation the Small Store formats that the Company has
established and is operating across India and consequently such business shall continue to be an
integral part of the Company’s business.
10.2 Accordingly, any sale, divestment, transfer, disposal, etc., of such retail outlets/ formats
including without limitation the Small Store Formats shall be in accordance with this Agreement,
and the company and the Existing shareholders covenant and undertake that during the subsistence
of this Agreement, the company shall not transfer, or dispose off the Retail Assets except as
otherwise mutually agreed between the Company, the Existing Shareholders and FCL in writing.
10.3 Notwithstanding anything contained herein, the Company and the Existing Shareholders agree
that the Retail Assets shall not be transferred, Encumbered divested, or disposed of, directly or
indirectly, in favour of a Restricted Person.
There is no dispute that one of the restricted persons included the Reliance Group.
5. As in March 2020, FRL submitted that there was business downturn due to Covid−19 lockdowns
as there were restrictions on retail sale through brick−and−mortar shops. In light of the same, the
Board of FRL decided to sell, retail businesses and assets to Reliance, for a consideration in excess of
Rs. 25,000 crores. Further, it is contended by FRL that there were outstanding loans of about
Rs.20,000 crores with a serious and tangible risk of becoming insolvent. It is submitted that it was
in this context that the subsequent transaction was entered into to alleviate its financial position and
protect employment of around 25,000 employees of the Future Group.

6. Aggrieved by the aforesaid sale transaction, Amazon initiated arbitration proceedings before the
SIAC. Amazon filed an application for emergency relief with the Registrar of the SIAC Court of
Arbitration seeking interim prohibitory injunction to prevent FRL and FCPL from taking further
steps in the aforesaid transaction with the Reliance Group. Parallelly, FRL filed a suit before the
Delhi High Court registered as CS(COMM) No. 493 of 2020, against Amazon for tortious
interference in the Scheme for the sale of assets.
7. On 25.10.2020, the Emergency Arbitrator passed an Interim Award in favor of Amazon. It may be
noticed that the Emergency Arbitrator and the Single Bench came to diametrically opposite
conclusions which are juxtaposed herein below:− Order of Emergency Arbitrator Order of Single
Judge Bench dated 25.10.2020 in I.A. No. 10376 of 2020 in CS(COMM) No. 493 of 2020 dated

There is yet another aspect as to why no interim injunction can be granted in the present application
for the reason both FRL and Amazon have already made their representations and counter
representations to the statutory authorities/regulators and now it is for the Statutory
Authorities/Regulators to take a decision thereon.
Therefore, this Court finds that no case for grant of interim injunction is made out in favour of the
FRL and against Amazon.
13. Consequently, the present application is disposed of, declining the grant of interim injunction as
prayed for by FRL, however, the Statutory Authorities/Regulators are directed to take the decision
on the applications/objections in accordance with law.
8. In the meanwhile, CCI and SEBI approved the composite Scheme proposed by FRL−Reliance.
Thereafter, FRL filed for sanction of the composite Scheme of arrangement under the provisions of
Sections 230 to 232 of the Companies Act, 2013 before National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT).
9. Amazon filed a Petition for enforcement of the Emergency Arbitrator Award, under Section 17(2)
of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996, before the Delhi High Court on 25.01.2021 and the
same was heard for the first time on 28.01.2021. As the appellants herein challenge the impugned
order on the ground of failure to adhere to the principles of natural justice, it is apt to reproduce
certain procedural orders passed by the learned Single Judge, Justice Midha, in OMP (ENF)
Future Coupons Private Limited vs Amazon.Com Nv Investment ... on 1 February, 2022

3. List for rejoinder submissions of the petitioner on 02nd February, 2021.
4. It is clarified that no further written submissions shall be filed by any of the

10. On 02.02.2021, the first substantive order [1st impugned Order] was passed in the following
manner: “8. This Court is of the prima facie view that the Emergency Arbitrator is an Arbitrator; the
Emergency Arbitrator has rightly proceeded against the respondent No.2; the order dated 25th
October, 2020 is not a nullity; the order dated 25th October, 2020 is an order under Section 17(1) of
the Arbitration and Conciliation Act. This Court is of the view that the order dated 25th October,
2020 is appealable under Section 37 of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act. This Court is of the
Future Coupons Private Limited vs Amazon.Com Nv Investment ... on 1 February, 2022
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/151398965/
5
clear view that the order dated 25th October, 2020 is enforceable as an order of this Court under
Section 17(2) of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act. The detailed reasons shall be given in the
reserved order.
9. This Court is satisfied that immediate orders are necessary to protect the rights of the petitioner
till the pronouncement of the reserved order. In that view of the matter, the respondents are
directed to maintain status quo as on today at 04.50 P.M. till the pronouncement of the reserved
order. The respondents are directed to file an affidavit to place on record the actions taken by them
after 25th October, 2020 and the present status of all those actions, within 10 days. All the
concerned authorities are directed to maintain status quo with respect to all matters in violation of
the order dated 25th October, 2020 and shall file the status report with respect to the present status
within 10 days of the receipt of this order. The other prayers of the petitioner shall be considered in
the reserved order.
10. Copy of this order be given dasti under signatures of the Court Master to counsels for the parties.
Copy of this order be also given dasti under signatures of the Court Master to Mr. Kirtiman Singh,
learned Central Government Standing Counsel who shall send the same to all the concerned
authorities dealing with the actions initiated by the respondents in violation of the order dated 25th
October, 2020. The petitioner shall send the list of all the authorities to Mr. Kirtiman Singh, learned
Central Government Standing Counsel within three days.”
11. Aggrieved by the stay order granted by the learned Single Judge, while reserving the matter, FRL
filed an intra−court appeal before the Division Bench in FAO OS (Comm.) No. 21 of 2021. The
Division Bench vide Order dated 08.02.2021, passed the following order:
“12. It is made clear that the observations made in this order are only a prima facie
view for the purpose of grant of interim relief and shall not come in the way of the
learned Single Judge in passing the final order in OMP(ENF)(Comm) No.17/2021
and needless to state that the order shall be passed uninfluenced by any observations
made hereinabove.”
12. Amazon appealed against this Order before the Supreme Court in SLP (C) No. 2856−57 of 2021.
Vide order dated 22.02.2021, this Court inter−alia held as under:
“In the meantime, the NCLT proceedings will be allowed to go on but will not
culminate in any final order of sanction of scheme.” (Emphasis supplied)
13. Again on 18.03.2021, the learned Single Judge in OMP (ENF) (COMM) No.17 of 2021, passed the
2nd impugned order with aforesaid directions:
“188. The Emergency Arbitrator is an Arbitrator for all intents and purposes; order of
the Emergency Arbitrator is an order under Section 17(1) and enforceable as an order
of this Court under Section 17(2) of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act.

…………
190. The respondents have raised a vague plea of Nullity without substantiating the
same. The interim order of the Emergency Arbitrator is not a Nullity as alleged by
respondent No.2.
191. Combining/treating all the agreements as a single integrated transaction does
not amount to control of the petitioner over FRL and therefore, the petitioner’s
investment does not violate any law.
192. All the objections raised by the respondents are hereby rejected with cost of
Rs.20,00,000/− to be deposited by the respondents with the Prime Minister Relief
Fund for being used for providing COVID vaccination to the Below Poverty Line
(BPL) category − senior citizens of Delhi. The cost be deposited within a period of two
weeks and the receipt be placed on record within one week of the deposit.
193. The respondents have deliberately and wilfully violated the interim order dated
25th October, 2020 and are liable for the consequences enumerated in Order XXXIX
Rule 2A of the Code of Civil Procedure.
194. In exercise of power under Order XXXIX Rule 2A(1) of the Code of Civil Procedure, the assets
of respondents No.1 to 13 are hereby attached. Respondents No.1 to 13 are directed to file an
affidavit of their assets as on today in Form 16A, Appendix E under Order XXI Rule 41(2) of the
Code of Civil Procedure within 30 days. Respondent No.1, 2, 12 and 13 are directed to file an
additional affidavit in the format of Annexure B−1 and respondents No.3 to 11 are directed to file an
additional affidavit in the format of Annexure A−1 to the judgment of M/s Bhandari Engineers &
Builders Pvt. Ltd. v. M/s Maharia Raj Joint Venture, (supra) along with the documents mentioned
therein within 30 days.”
14. In the interregnum, the FCPL and FRL approached the Division Bench of the Delhi High Court
in FAO (OS) (COM) No.50 and 51 of 2021 respectively against the 2nd impugned order passed by
the learned Single Judge which was stayed vide Order dated 22.03.2021.
15. Subsequently, Amazon filed SLP (C) Nos. 6113−6114 of 2021 before this Court against the order
dated 22.03.2021 passed by the Division Bench of the High Court.
16. This Court consolidated all the appeals filed by Amazon before this Court, heard the matters
together and passed a final judgment dated 06.08.2021, answering only the following two legal
questions:
i. Whether an Emergency Arbitrator’s Award can be said to be within the contemplation of the
Arbitration Act?
Future Coupons Private Limited vs Amazon.Com Nv Investment ... on 1 February, 2022
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/151398965/
7
ii. Whether an order passed under Section 17(2) of the Arbitration Act, in enforcement proceedings,
is appealable under Section 37 of the Arbitration Act?
17. This Court answered the first question in the following manner:
“41. We, therefore, answer the first question by declaring that full party autonomy is
given by the Arbitration Act to have a dispute decided in accordance with
institutional rules which can include Emergency Arbitrators delivering interim
orders, described as “awards”. Such orders are an important step in aid of
decongesting the civil courts and affording expeditious interim relief to the parties.
Such orders are referable to and are made under Section 17(1) of the Arbitration Act.”
The second question was answered thus:
“76. The second question posed is thus answered declaring that no appeal lies under
Section 37 of the Arbitration Act against an order of enforcement of an Emergency
Arbitrator’s order made under Section 17(2) of the Act. As a result, all interim orders
of this Court stand vacated. The impugned judgments of the Division Bench, dated
8th February, 2021 and 22nd March, 2021, are set aside. The appeals are disposed of
accordingly.”
18. It may be noted that this Court, in the aforesaid judgment of 06.08.2021, did not
adjudicate upon the merits of the case and limited its reasoning only to answer the
legal questions which arose therein. On a reading of this judgment, the contention of
the learned Senior Advocate Mr. Gopal Subramanium, that this Court has upheld the
Emergency Arbitrator Award and did not interfere with the enforcement orders in
OMP (ENF)(Comm.) No. 17 of 2021, on merits, is not correct. Although, the
judgment narrates the facts leading up to the appeal, the Court neither returned any
findings on facts, nor adjudicated on merits of the Order passed by Justice Midha in
the enforcement proceedings. It is this gap which has led to the current round of
litigation on merits of the case for the second time before this Court.
19. In the meanwhile, FRL filed an application under Para 10 of Schedule 1 of the SIAC Rules for
vacating the Award of the Emergency Arbitrator before the Arbitral Tribunal. The oral submissions
on the vacate petitions were heard between 12 th− 16th of July 2021 and orders were reserved.
20. Contemporaneously, aggrieved by the merits of the orders of the Single Judge dated 02.02.2021
and 18.03.2021, FCPL and FRL preferred appeals directly before this Court in SLP (C) No. 13547−48
of 2021 and SLP (C) No. 13556−57 of 2021, respectively. On 09.09.2021 the following interim order
was passed by this Court:− “Heard learned senior counsel for the parties at length and carefully
perused the material placed on record.
Issue notice.
Future Coupons Private Limited vs Amazon.Com Nv Investment ... on 1 February, 2022
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/151398965/

Taking into consideration the submissions advanced by the learned senior counsel for the parties
and particularly the fact that the parties have approached the Singapore International Arbitration
Centre for vacating the Emergency Award passed by the Emergency Arbitrator and the arguments in
the said matter have been ssconcluded and the order is going to be pronounced shortly, we think it
fit to balance the interest of both the parties by staying all further proceedings before the Delhi High
Court for the time being. Ordered accordingly. We further direct to all the authorities i.e. NCLT, CCI
and SEBI not to pass any final order for a period of four weeks from today. This order has been
passed with the consent of both the parties.
List these matters after four weeks.” (Emphasis supplied)
21. Thereafter, the applications filed by FRL and FCPL for vacating the award of the Emergency
Arbitrator was dismissed by the Arbitral Tribunal by Order dated 21.10.2021.
22. The aforesaid order of the Arbitral Tribunal, rejecting the vacate petition, was challenged by
FCPL and FRL before the Delhi High Court in Arb. Pet. No. 63 of 2021 and Arb. Pet. No. 64 of 2021.
In Arb. Pet. No. 64 of 2021, FRL had filed IA No. 14285/2021, seeking the following prayers:
a. Stay the operation of the impugned Order dated 21.10.2021 passed by the Hon’ble
Arbitral Tribunal. b. Alternatively, pass an order allowing the Appellant to take steps
pursuing the scheme, subject to the condition that it shall not invite the passing of
any final orders of approval of the scheme by the NCLT.
23. While issuing notice in both matters, by orders dated 29.10.2021 (3rd impugned Order), the
Delhi High Court (Justice Suresh Kumar Kait) refused any immediate relief to FRL in the following
words:
“15. During the course of hearing, this Court time and again referred that when the
subject matter of this appeal is pending sub−judice before the Hon’ble Supreme
Court in Special Leave Petition (Civil) No. 13547− 48/2021 and infact, by virtue of
order dated 09.09.2021 proceedings before this Court have been stayed and also
directions have been passed to NCLT, CCI, SEBI to not pass any final order, then how
interim relief, that too without there−being any hearing or any reply from side
opposite on record, application for interim stay can be heard and orders be passed.
Upon this, Mr. Harish Salve, learned senior counsel submitted in such eventuality,
this Court may dismiss the application.
16. In view of the above, the application seeking CPC) is accordingly dismissed.”
24. Aggrieved by the aforesaid order, FCPL and FRL have approached this Court in SLP (C) Nos.
18089 and 18080 of 2021 respectively.
25. Mr. Harish Salve, learned Senior Counsel appearing for FRL submitted that the orders in the
enforcement proceedings have been rendered while completely disregarding the order dated
Future Coupons Private Limited vs Amazon.Com Nv Investment ... on 1 February, 2022
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/151398965/

21.12.2020 passed by the learned Single Judge of the Delhi High Court in CS(Comm) No. 493 of
2020, particularly, the finding that FRL does not have any arbitration agreement with the
respondent. He further submitted that although an appeal has been filed against the aforesaid order
of the learned Single Judge, there is no stay operating against the said order.
26. The learned Senior counsel also submitted that the impugned orders passed in the enforcement
proceedings merit setting aside as the said proceedings have been conducted contrary to the
principles of natural justice. He submitted that the procedure adopted has caused serious prejudice
to the appellants as, after denying them an opportunity to file a reply affidavit, the impugned orders
in the Enforcement proceedings recorded that FRL had not made any plea on the issue as to why
were the orders of the Emergency Arbitrator a nullity.
27. Thirdly, the learned Senior counsel contended that the impugned orders passed in the
Enforcement proceedings extended beyond the scope of the Emergency Arbitrator’s interim Award,
by directing recall of the approvals granted by the Statutory Authorities.
28. Lastly, while relying upon the Singapore Arbitration Rules, learned Senior counsel submitted
that the Tribunal’s interim order dated 21.10.2021, overrides the Emergency Arbitrator’s interim
Award which are the subject matter of the impugned enforcement proceedings. As a result, the
enforcement proceedings and the impugned order have lost their relevance due to the subsequent
events.
29. Mr. Mukul Rohatgi, learned Senior Counsel appearing for FCPL and their promoters, while
supplementing the submissions of Mr. Salve, specifically contended that the impugned order merits
setting aside due to grave injustice caused to the appellants due to the principles of natural justice
being given a go−by. No opportunity was granted for filing of any response which has resulted in
various factual and legal errors creeping in the impugned order. He further submitted that
considering the procedure followed by it, the penal orders passed by the High Court in the
impugned order, merit a reconsideration.
30. Learned Senior counsel further submitted that no prejudice would be caused to Amazon by
setting aside the impugned order passed in the enforcement proceedings or by the passing of an
interim measure allowing continuation of the proceedings before the NCLT. In fact, this Court, vide
order dated 22.02.2021, has already created an interim arrangement by allowing the NCLT
proceedings to continue with a direction to the NCLT not to pass any final order. On the other hand,
the impugned order dated 18.03.2021, directed recall of the approvals granted by the statutory
authorities.
31. Mr. Gopal Subramanium, learned Senior Counsel appearing for Amazon, submitted that the
appellants, by their conduct have demonstrated willful and intentional disobedience of the
Emergency Arbitrator’s interim Award, after agreeing for the Emergency Arbitrator. While he fairly
stated that Amazon is not interested in pursuing the punitive directions imposed on FCPL and
others, he submitted that the Emergency Arbitrator’s interim Award stands confirmed by the
Arbitral Tribunal, which must be abided by the appellants. Learned Counsel argued that when no

Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/151398965/
10
stay has been granted against the interim protection afforded to them by the Arbitral Tribunal, the
appellants cannot operate in contravention of the same and proceed to effectuate the scheme before
the NCLT. He lastly submitted that pending any challenge, the interim orders passed by the
Tribunal needs to be maintained and given effect to, so as to uphold the effectiveness and sanctity of
the arbitration process.
32. Mr. Aspi Chinoy, learned Senior Counsel appearing for Amazon contended that the appellants’
reliance on the order dated 21.12.20, passed by the learned Single Judge of the Delhi High Court in
the suit proceeding is misplaced. He submitted that, in the first instance, the suit instituted by FRL
before the Delhi High Court was of the nature of an anti− arbitration suit and a collateral challenge
to the arbitration proceedings which is in contravention to Section 5 of the Arbitration Act. He
further submitted that the observations being relied upon by the appellants were made in an order
declining the relief sought by them before the Delhi High Court. Finally, the learned Senior counsel
submitted that no relief should be granted to the appellants by this Court as they have not
approached this Court with clean hands having failed to comply with any judicial order that has
been passed.
33. Having heard learned counsel for both the parties and on perusing voluminous documents
submitted before the Court, the following questions arise for our consideration : I. Whether the
orders dated 02.02.2021 and 18.03.2021, passed by the learned Single Judge in OMP (ENF) (COM)
No.17 of 2021, are valid in law?
II. Whether the orders dated 29.10.2021, passed by the learned Single Judge in Arb. A (Comm.) No.
64 and 63 of 2021, is valid in law?
Question No. I
34. The orders of the learned Single Judge [Justice Midha] in OMP (ENF) (COMM) No.17 of 2021, is
impugned on the grounds of lack of an opportunity granted to FCPL and FRL to file a counter to
establish their defense. Mr. Rohatgi, learned Senior Advocate appearing on behalf of FCPL and its
promoters has submitted that no time was granted by the learned Single Judge to respond. He
added that a 200−page order has been passed without any reply being filed on record and holding
everyone guilty of contempt of court. He has further submitted that punitive directions could not
have been passed even in contempt jurisdiction without affording the party a proper opportunity of
filing a reply.
35. In this context, our attention has been drawn to a catena of procedural orders passed by the
High Court in OMP (ENF) (COMM) No.17 of 2021. From the record, we observe that FRL and FCPL
were not provided sufficient time or opportunity to file their counter or raise their defense. On
29.01.2021, they were allowed to file a brief note of submission within twenty− four hours, before
orders were passed on 02.02.2021.
36. On a perusal of the orders, we find that serious procedural errors were committed by the learned
Single Judge. Natural justice is an important facet of a judicial review. Providing effective natural

justice to affected parties, before a decision is taken, is necessary to maintain the Rule of law.
Natural justice is usually discussed in the context of administrative actions, wherein procedural
requirement of a fair hearing is read in to ensure that no injustice is caused. When it comes to
judicial review, the natural justice principle is built into the rules and procedures of the Court, which
are expected to be followed meticulously to ensure that highest standards of fairness are afforded to
the parties.
37. It is well known that natural justice is the sworn enemy of unfairness. It is expected of the Courts
to be cautious and afford a reasonable opportunity to parties, especially in commercial matters
having a serious impact on the economy and employment of thousands of people. Coming to the
facts herein, the opportunity provided to the appellants herein was insufficient, and cannot be
upheld in the eyes of law.
38. Whenever an order is struck down as invalid being in violation of the principles of natural
justice, there is no final decision of the case and fresh proceedings are left open. All that is done is to
vacate the order assailed by virtue of its inherent defect. Such proceedings are not terminated and
are usually remitted back. [See Canara Bank v. Debasis Das, (2003) 4 SCC 557] However, in this
case, much water has flown under the bridge, since the passing of the order by the learned Single
Judge, which has now been rendered redundant, for the following reasons :
† Initially, this Court by order dated 22.02.2021, had allowed proceedings to continue before the
NCLT without finalization of the scheme.
†  Thereafter, learned Single Judge passed the 2 nd impugned order on 18.03.2021, without
considering the order of this Court dated 22.02.2021. † Subsequently, the Division Bench in FAO
(OS)(COM) No. 50 and 51 of 2021, had stayed the aforesaid order of the Single Judge, which was
taken in appeal again before this Court.
† This Court finally disposed of the case, answering only two legal questions, without adjudicating
on the merits of the matter.
†  In the meanwhile, FRL and FCPL had moved the Arbitral Tribunal, for vacating the interim
injunction granted by the Emergency Arbitrator.
† In view of the pendency of the aforesaid application before the Arbitral Tribunal, this Court again
through interim order dated 09.09.2021, allowed continuation of proceedings before the NCLT,
without final authorization on the scheme.
39. One aspect which may be highlighted is the punitive directions ordered by the learned Single
Judge in the order dated 18.03.2021, which are extracted below:
“192. All the objections raised by the respondents are hereby rejected with cost of
Rs.20,00,000/− to be deposited by the respondents with the Prime Minister Relief
Fund for being used for providing COVID vaccination to the Below Poverty Line

(BPL) category − senior citizens of Delhi. The cost be deposited within a period of two
weeks and the receipt be placed on record within one week of the deposit.
193. The respondents have deliberately and wilfully violated the interim order dated
25th October, 2020 and are liable for the consequences enumerated in Order XXXIX
Rule 2A of the Code of Civil Procedure.
194. In exercise of power under Order XXXIX Rule 2A(1) of the Code, the assets of
the respondents No.1 to 13 are hereby attached. Respondents No. 1 to 13 are directed
to file an affidavit of their assets as on today in Form 16A, Appendix E under Order
XXI Rule 41(2) of the Code of Civil Procedure within 30 days. Respondent No. 1, 2, 12
and 13 are directed to file an additional affidavit in the format of Annexure B−1 and
respondents no.
3 to 11 are directed to file an additional affidavit in the format of Annexure A−1 to the judgment of
M/s. Bhandari Engineers & Builders Pvt. Ltd. v. M/s. Maharia Raj Joint Venture, (supra) along with
the documents mentioned therein within 30 days.”
40. Our attention is drawn to the fact that the learned Single Judge had relied on M/s. Bhandari
Engineers & Builders Pvt. Ltd. v. M/s. Maharia Raj Joint Venture, 2019 SCC Online Del. 11879,
which has been overruled by a Division Bench order in Delhi Chemical and Pharmaceutical Works
Pvt. Ltd. & Anr. v. Himgiri Realtors Pvt. Ltd. & Anr., EFA (OS) (Comm.) No. 4 of 2021.
41. Viewed differently, contempt of a civil nature can be made out under Order XXXIX Rule 2−A
CPC not when there has been mere “disobedience”, but only when there has been “wilful
disobedience”. The allegation of wilful disobedience being in the nature of criminal liability, the
same has to be proved to the satisfaction of the court that the disobedience was not mere
“disobedience” but “wilful” and “conscious”. This Court in the case of Ram Kishan v. Tarun Bajaj,
(2014) 16 SCC 204, considering the implication of exercise of contempt jurisdiction, held that the
power must be exercised with caution rather than on mere probabilities. While delineating the
conduct which can be held to be “wilful disobedience”, this Court held that:
“12. Thus, in order to punish a contemnor, it has to be established that disobedience
of the order is “wilful”. The word “wilful” introduces a mental element and hence,
requires looking into the mind of a person/contemnor by gauging his actions, which
is an indication of one's state of mind. “Wilful” means knowingly intentional,
conscious, calculated and deliberate with full knowledge of consequences flowing
therefrom. It excludes casual, accidental, bona fide or unintentional acts or genuine
inability. Wilful acts does not encompass involuntarily or negligent actions. The act
has to be done with a “bad purpose or without justifiable excuse or stubbornly,
obstinately or perversely”. Wilful act is to be distinguished from an act done
carelessly, thoughtlessly, heedlessly or inadvertently. It does not include any act done
negligently or involuntarily. The deliberate conduct of a person means that he knows
what he is doing and intends to do the same. Therefore, there has to be a calculated

13
action with evil motive on his part. Even if there is a disobedience of an order, but
such disobedience is the result of some compelling circumstances under which it was
not possible for the contemnor to comply with the order, the contemnor cannot be
punished. “Committal or sequestration will not be ordered unless contempt involves
a degree of default or misconduct.” (Emphasis supplied)
42. Considering the fact that in the suit instituted by FRL, the learned Single Judge had earlier
allowed FRL and Amazon to continue their pursuit before various regulatory authorities, and in
view of the interim orders of this Court dated 22.02.2021 and 09.09.2021, and the Courts below, we
are inclined to set−aside aforesaid directions as the pre−condition of ‘sufficient mental element for
wilful disobedience’ is not satisfied. Moreover, Mr. Gopal Subramanium, learned Senior Advocate
appearing for Amazon, has fairly stated that Amazon is not interested in proceeding with the
punitive directions. Taking note of the aforesaid submission, we set aside the punitive directions
issued in the impugned orders of learned Single Judge dated 02.02.2021 and 18.03.2021.
43. Coming to the merits of the case, we would like to mention a disconcerting aspect wherein the
interim order enforcing the Emergency Award has adopted a standard beyond ‘prima facie view’, as
required under law. It is expected of Courts to be cautious while making observations on the merits
of the case, which would inevitably influence the Arbitral Tribunals hearing the matters on merit.
44. Therefore, we set aside the order of the learned Single Judge dated 02.02.2021 and 18.03.2021
passed in OMP (ENF) (COMM.) No.17 of 2021.
Question No. II
45. At the outset, it is agreed by learned advocates appearing on both side that the impugned order
dated 29.10.2021 in IA No. 14285/2021 moved in Arb. A (Comm.) No. 64 of 2021, needs to be set
aside for non−consideration of the orders of this Court in the proper perspective. Our order dated
09.09.2021, imposed no bar on the High Court to adjudicate the issue concerning legality of the
vacate application order by the Arbitral Tribunal. In our opinion, adjudication of the applications
under Section 37(2), Arbitration Act filed by the appellants before the Delhi High Court are distinct
from the earlier appeals filed before this Court.
46. Further, certain important questions of law concerning the effect of the award of an Emergency
Arbitrator and the jurisdiction of an Arbitral Tribunal qua such awards arise in the present matter.
Therefore, these matters need to be remitted back for adjudication on its own merits.
47. In view of the above, we order:
I. Setting aside of impugned orders dated 02.02.2021 (1 st impugned Order) and 18.03.2021 (2 nd
impugned order) in OMP (ENF)(Comm.) No. 17 of 2021.
II. Setting aside of 3rd impugned order dated 29.10.2021 in Arb. A. (Comm.) No. 64 and 63 of
2021.The learned Single Judge shall reconsider the issues and pass appropriate orders on its own
