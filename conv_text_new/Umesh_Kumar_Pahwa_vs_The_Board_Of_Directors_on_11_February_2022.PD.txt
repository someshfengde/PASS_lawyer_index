M. R. Shah, J.
1. Feeling aggrieved and dissatisfied with the impugned common judgment and order dated
17.07.2018 passed by the High Court of Uttarakhand at Nainital in Writ Petition (S/B) No.4 of 2013
and Writ Petition (S/B) No.267 of 2013 as well as Signature Not Verified the order passed in the
review applications dismissing the Digitally signed by R Natarajan Date: 2022.02.11 16:55:53 IST
Reason:
same vide common order dated 08.01.2020, the employee − the original writ petitioner has
preferred the present appeals.
2. That the appellant herein was serving as a Branch Officer at Pratap Pur Branch of the Respondent
– Bank. He has put in 28 years’ of service. While he was serving at Pratap Pur Branch during the
period 27.06.2008 to 21.11.2008, a complaint was made against the appellant by one borrower of
the Bank namely Karamjeet Singh on 17.09.2008 alleging that the appellant had sanctioned the
limit of loan of Rs.1,50,000/− which was later on reduced to Rs.75,000/−. Four other persons also
made the complaint against the appellant. On receiving the complaint against the appellant − the
Chairman of the Bank transferred him to another branch of the Bank, during pendency of the
inquiry pertaining to aforesaid complaints. A show cause notice was issued to the appellant seeking
his explanation. The appellant replied to the said show cause notice stating therein that the

allegations in the complaint are baseless, frivolous and fabricated. He also made allegations of
malice and bias against the Chairman of the Bank. The disciplinary proceedings were initiated
against the appellant. A charge−sheet was issued to him and following charges were framed:
“1. He did not discharge his duties with integrity and honesty and took such actions
and committed such omissions which showed lack of probity and integrity on his
part.
2. He committed serious violations of duty and breach of trust reposed in him by the
Bank and misused his official position.
3. In the performance of his official duties and in exercise of powers conferred on
him, he unauthorizedly exceeded his authority / powers and did not report the same
for / or obtained approval / confirmation from higher authorities for such excessive
actions.
4. He flouted instructions of the higher authorities.
5. He adopted such steps and took such actions as were derogatory, prejudicial and
detrimental to the interest of the bank.
6. He misrepresented and suppressed material facts from higher authorities.
7. He knowingly and willfully violated Bank’s rules and established procedures for his
personal gains.
8. Due to his acts, bank is likely to suffer financial losses.
9. He committed such acts which tarnished the image of the Bank.
10. He did acts unbecoming of an officer of the Bank” 2.1 That the Bank decided to initiate an
inquiry for a major punishment. The appellant participated in the departmental inquiry. The
complainant, Karamjeet Singh was also examined during the inquiry. The inquiry officer held the
charges No.1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 7, 8, 9 and 10 as proved. On receipt of the inquiry report the appellant
submitted his reply and contended that the findings of the Inquiry Officer are perverse to the
material placed on record and against the principle of natural justice. He also made allegations of
bias against the Chairman of the Bank. Thereafter after considering the inquiry report and giving
opportunity to the appellant, the disciplinary authority/Chairman of the Bank passed an order of
removal of the appellant from service. The appellant preferred an appeal before the Appellate
Authority and the Appellant Authority dismissed the appeal vide order dated 20.12.2011. Feeling
aggrieved against the order of removal from service, the appellant preferred the present writ petition
before the High Court being Writ Petition (S/B) No.4 of 2013. 2.2 During the pendency of Writ
Petition (S/B) No.4 of 2013 the appellant also preferred another Writ Petition No.267 of 2013
seeking a writ of mandamus commanding the Bank to grant promotion from Scale II to Scale III

from the date when those junior to him were promoted w.e.f. 30.03.2005. Both the writ petitions
were heard together. By the impugned judgment and order the High Court has dismissed Writ
Petition (S/B) No.4 of 2013 confirming the order of removal from service of the appellant. As the
order of removal had been confirmed, the High Court without further entering into the merits of the
case also dismissed Writ Petition (S/B) No.267 of 2013 which was for seeking promotion from Scale
II to Scale III officer from the date when those juniors to the appellant were promoted i.e. w.e.f.
30.03.2005.
Feeling aggrieved and dissatisfied with the impugned common judgment and order passed in Writ
Petition (S/B) No.267 of 2013 as well as W.P. (S/B.) No.4 of 2013, the employee delinquent has
preferred the present appeals.
3. We have heard the learned counsel for the respective parties at length.
3.1 Having considered the impugned judgment and order passed by the High Court and even the
findings recorded by the Inquiry officer it appears that the High Court has observed that the
appellant demanded a bribe from Karamjeet Singh solely on the basis of his cross−examination.
However, it is required to be noted that he had a reason to speak against the appellant as his loan
amount was reduced from Rs.1,50,000/− to Rs.75,000/− by the appellant. It is the case on behalf of
the appellant that considering the material and his capacity a decision was taken to reduce the loan
amount from Rs.1,50,000/− to Rs.75,000/− which was taken in the interest of the bank. There are
allegations of bias against the Chairman right from the very beginning. Even at one point of time the
Chairman was charge−sheeted for the offences under Sections 323, 354, 504, 506 IPC on the
complaint filed by the wife of the appellant and on the basis of complaint filed by a woman delegate.
It is true that subsequent thereto the criminal proceedings were quashed by the High Court. Be that
it may, there were specific allegations of bias against the Chairman and the Bank right from the
initiation of the departmental proceedings made by the appellant. 3.2 Even looking to the charges
proved in the departmental proceedings we find that as such, there is no financial loss caused to the
Bank and on the contrary a decision was taken by the appellant to reduce the loan amount from
Rs.1,50,000/− to Rs.75,000/− in the case of Karamjeet Singh −the complainant, which can be said
to be the decision in the bank’s interest. Moreover, the fact that the appellant had worked for 28
years and during those 28 years there are no allegations against him, in the facts and circumstances
of the case, we are of the opinion that the punishment of removal for the charges proved and the
misconduct established, is too harsh and disproportionate. However, considering the fact that it can
be said to be a case of loss of confidence in the employee by the Bank, we deem it just and proper to
substitute the punishment from that of removal of service to that of compulsory retirement.
4. So far as the submission on behalf of the appellant that the appellant has not conducted any
misconduct and the finding recorded by the inquiry officer on the charges proved are perverse is
concerned, the High Court is justified in holding that in the limited jurisdiction available to the High
Court in exercise of powers under Article 226 of the Constitution of India, the High Court is not
required to reappreciate the evidence and/or interfere with the findings recorded by the inquiry
officer accepted by the disciplinary authority. However, as observed hereinabove the order of
removal of service can be said to be disproportionate to the charges and misconduct held to be

proved.
5. Now in so far as the dismissal of Writ Petition (S/B) No.267 of 2013 is concerned, at the outset it
is required to be noted that the High Court has not dealt with and considered the same on merits
independently. The High Court has dismissed the said writ petition for promotion primarily on the
ground that once he is removed from service there is no question of considering his case for
promotion. However, it is required to be noted that the appellant claimed the promotion from Scale
II to Scale III from the date when his juniors came to be promoted w.e.f. 30.03.2005. From the
material available on record, it appears that in the earlier round of litigation being Writ Petition
(S/B) No.65 of 2012, the High Court had directed the Bank to consider his case for promotion
considering his ACR for the Financial Years 1999−2000 to 2003−2004. The said exercise was
required to be done by the Bank. Therefore, so far as the Writ Petition (S/B) No.267 of 2013 is
concerned, the same is required to be remanded to the High Court to decide the same afresh in
accordance with law and on its own merits.
6. In view of the above and for the reasons stated above the impugned Judgment and Order passed
by the High Court passed in Writ Petition (S/B) No.4 of 2013 is hereby modified to the extent
substituting the punishment from that of removal of service to that of compulsory retirement.
The appellant shall be entitled to all the benefits which may be available to him by converting the
punishment from that of removal of service to that of compulsory retirement. So far as the
impugned judgment and order of the High Court in Writ Petition (S/B) No.267 of 2013 is
concerned, in view of the above and for the reason stated above and as the High Court has not
decided the said writ petition on merits, we set aside the impugned judgment and order as well as
the order dated 08.01.2020 dismissing the said Writ Petition (S/B) No.267 of 2013 and remand the
matter to the High Court to decide the same afresh in accordance with law and on its own merits.
Present appeals are accordingly allowed to the aforesaid extent. However, in the facts and
circumstances of the case, there shall be no order as to costs.
