                                                 JUDGMENT
B.R. GAVAI, J.
1. The Criminal Appeals challenge the common judgment and order of conviction and sentence
dated 28 th October 2008 and 30th October 2008 passed by the Madras High Court whereby the
Appellant has been convicted under Section 138 of Signature Not Verified Digitally signed by
Deepak Singh the Negotiable Instruments Act, 1881 (hereinafter referred to as Date: 2023.01.18
15:52:12 IST Reason:
“the N.I. Act”) and has been sentenced to a fine of Rs. 7 Lakhs in each case in respect of two cheques
for an amount of Rs. 3.5 Lakhs.
2. The Civil Appeals challenge the judgments dated 08th August 2011 and 03rd February 2012
passed by the Madras High Court whereby the Original Suits filed by the plaintiff−  respondents for
recovery of money on the basis of promissory notes were decreed.
3. For the sake of convenience, the parties will be referred to as their status before this Court.
4. Since both the Criminal Appeals arise out of a common judgment, we consider it apposite to refer
to the facts in Criminal Appeal No.1978 of 2013. Insofar as the Civil Appeals are concerned, while
they arise out of different judgments, for the sake of convenience, we shall refer to the facts arising
from Civil Appeal No.10501 of 2013.
5. The present appeals arise from the following factual matrix:

1
5.1 In 1992, the Appellant− Rajaram’s wife subscribed to a 5−  year chit− fund with one
Maruthachalam, the Respondent in Criminal Appeal No. 1978/2013 and Civil Appeal
No.10500/2013. Upon the Respondent− Maruthachalam’s persuasion that, in order to be a
successful bidder, a security by way of a blank cheque must be submitted, the Appellant submitted
two signed blank cheques bearing nos. 237954 and 237956 on behalf of his wife, since she did not
have a bank account. It is to be noted that the cheques were drawn on the account of M/s Brinda
Engineering, the sole proprietorship concern of the Appellant, maintained with the Laxmi Vilas
Bank Ltd. 5.2 It is further the case of the Appellant that in 1995, his wife subscribed to yet another
5− year chit− fund with the Respondent− Maruthachalam.
5.3 In 1997, the bank account on which the said cheques were drawn was closed due to non−
operation.
5.4 The first chit matured in 1997 and, since the wife of the Appellant was never a successful bidder,
thus, the Appellant and his wife repeatedly requested the Respondent to release the amount of the
chits, but the Respondent never did so. On the contrary, the Respondent promised to keep the
amount as a deposit and pay interest. Similarly, the second chit matured in 1999, whereafter also
the wife of the Appellant was never a successful bidder. Thereafter, repeated requests for releasing
the subscription amount to the tune of Rs. 6 lakhs for both the chits were made on their behalf, but
to no avail. Finally, the Appellant and his wife threatened the Respondent with legal action,
whereupon the Respondent immediately presented the cheques for encashment without any
information or intimation to the Appellant. 5.5 The Cheque No. 237954 was dated 20th October
1999 in favour of Respondent− Nachimuthu (who happens to be the brother− in− law of
Maruthachalam) for an amount of Rs. 3,50,000/, and was presented for encashment on 04 th
November 1999 by the Respondent through his banker Indian Overseas Bank. The said cheque
returned unpaid on 14th November 1999 with an endorsement stating “account closed”.
5.6 The other Cheque No. 237956 was dated 25 th October 1999 in favour of the Respondent−
Maruthachalam for an amount of Rs. 3,50,000/− , and was presented for encashment on 04th
November 1999 by the Respondent through his banker Indian Overseas Bank. The said cheque too
returned unpaid on 14th November 1999 with an endorsement stating “account closed”. 5.7
Statutory Notices dated 15th November 1999 were sent in respect of the aforesaid dishonoured
cheques, which were duly replied by the accused/Appellant denying the existence of any legally
enforceable debt and stating therein that the Respondent is liable to pay the chit amount along with
subsequent interest. Since the amount was not paid, the Respondents instituted Complaint Cases
under Section 138 of the N.I. Act, being CC No. 26 of 2000 in respect of Cheque No. 237954 and CC
No. 32 of 2000 in respect of Cheque No. 237956. Both the cases were dismissed by the learned Trial
Court on 10th July 2001 vide separate judgments.
5.8 Pursuant to the dismissal of the aforesaid cases, both the Respondents instituted civil/original
suits for recovery of money on the basis of Promissory Notes.
5.9 Original Suit No. 112/2003 (earlier OS No. 602/2002) was instituted by the Respondent−
Nachimuthu, alleging that the Appellant had borrowed a sum of Rs. 3 Lakhs on 20 th October 1998
Rajaram S/O Sriramulu ... vs Maruthachalam (Since ... on 18 January, 2023

from him and had executed a promissory note on the same day thereby promising to repay the same
with interest at 24% per annum. It was further alleged that the Appellant had issued a cheque on 20
th October 1999 for Rs. 3,50,000/−  towards the discharge of his liability and when the same was
presented for encashment, it was dishonoured as the Appellant had closed the account. Criminal
Case No. 32/2000 was pursued under Section 138 of the N.I. Act which was dismissed against which
an appeal was pending before the High Court.
5.10 Another Original Suit No. 266 of 2004 (earlier OS 746 of 2002) was instituted by the
Respondent− Maruthachalam, alleging that the Appellant had borrowed a sum of Rs. 3 Lakhs on
25th October 1998 from him and had executed a promissory note on 25th October 1998, thereby
promising to repay the same with interest at 24% per annum. It was further alleged that the
Appellant issued a cheque on 20 th October 1999 for Rs. 3,50,000/−  towards the discharge of his
liability and when the same was presented for encashment, it was dishonoured as the Appellant had
closed the account. Criminal Case No. 26/2000 was pursued under Section 138 of the N.I. Act which
was dismissed against which an appeal was pending before the High Court.
5.11 Original Suit No. 112 of 2003 and Original Suit No. 266 of 2004 came to be dismissed vide
judgment dated 06 th January 2004 and 29th July 2005 respectively. As against both the
judgments, appeals were preferred before the High Court.
5.12 The Appeals against the judgments in criminal matters were allowed by the High Court vide
common judgment and order of conviction and sentence dated 28.10.2008 and 30th October 2008.
5.13 In Appeal, Original Suit No. 266 of 2004 and Original Suit No. 112 of 2003 were decreed by the
High Court vide judgments dated 08th August 2011 and 03rd February 2012 respectively.
5.14 The Appeals against all the 3 judgments of the High Court are before us and are being disposed
of vide this common judgment.
6. We have heard Ms. Neha Sharma, learned counsel appearing for the Appellants in all the appeals,
and Mr. V. Prabhakar, learned counsel appearing for both the Respondents in all the appeals.
7. Ms. Neha Sharma submits that the High Court has erroneously reversed the well− reasoned
judgements of the learned Trial Court. She submitted that blank cheques issued in the year 1992 by
way of security for chit− funds were misused by the Respondents in the year 1999. She further
submitted that in the year 1999, when the cheques were sent for encashment, the Appellant was no
longer the proprietor of M/s Brinda Engineering and the bank account on which the said cheques
were drawn was not operated after 1992, and had already closed in 1997 due to non− operation. She
further submitted that even before the account was closed down, the wife of the Appellant became
the sole proprietor of the enterprise, and thus, the appellant could not have signed the said cheques
in the capacity of the proprietor of M/s Brinda Engineering.
8. The learned counsel submitted that the Respondents herein did not have the financial capacity to
lend an amount of Rs.3,00,000/−  each as on 20th October 1998 and 25th October 1998, when the

promissory notes were said to have been executed. It is further submitted that although it was the
Respondents’ case that they had given the amounts out of their agricultural income, since they had
not declared the same in their Income Tax Returns from 1992− 1999, thus, there was no material to
show that they could have lent money. To buttress her submissions, the learned counsel relies on the
judgment of this Court in the case of, Basalingappa v. Mudibasappa1,
9. Per contra, Mr. V. Prabhakar, learned counsel for the Respondents, submits that the Appellant−
Raja Ram had failed to produce any material evidence to substantiate the claim that his wife
subscribed to the chit− funds run by Respondent, Maruthachalam. He submitted that the High Court
rightly observed that no material was produced by the Appellant− Raja Ram to prove that the
cheques and promissory notes were issued only as a security for such a chit. He further submitted
that no legal proceedings were initiated for the recovery of the alleged amount due by the Appellant
either.
10. The learned counsel submitted that there arose no occasion for the Appellant− Raja Ram to issue
a blank cheque in the year 1992 for a chit to be subscribed much later in the year 1995. It is further
submitted that even if certain amounts are 1 (2019) 5 SCC 418 not accounted for in the Income Tax
Returns, this is a matter concerning only the defaulter and Revenue Authority. Thus, a borrower
cannot be allowed to take advantage of the same solely on the ground that such an amount does not
reflect in the Income Tax Returns. The learned counsel relied on the judgments of this Court in the
cases of Bir Singh v. Mukesh Kumar2, Rohitbhai Jivanlal Patel v. State of Gujarat and Anr3,
Kalamani Tex and Anr v. P. Balasubramanian4 to buttress his submissions.
11. We shall first consider the Criminal Appeals.
12. This Court in the case of Baslingappa v. Mudibasappa (supra) has summarized the principles on
Sections 118(a) and 139 of the N.I. Act. It will be relevant to reproduce the same.
“25. We having noticed the ratio laid down by this Court in the above cases on Sections 118(a) and
139, we now 2 (2019) 4 SCC 197 3 (2019) 18 SCC 106 4 (2021) 5 SCC 283 summarise the principles
enumerated by this Court in following manner:
25.1. Once the execution of cheque is admitted Section 139 of the Act mandates a presumption that
the cheque was for the discharge of any debt or other liability. 25.2. The presumption under Section
139 is a rebuttable presumption and the onus is on the accused to raise the probable defence. The
standard of proof for rebutting the presumption is that of preponderance of probabilities.
25.3. To rebut the presumption, it is open for the accused to rely on evidence led by him or the
accused can also rely on the materials submitted by the complainant in order to raise a probable
defence. Inference of preponderance of probabilities can be drawn not only from the materials
brought on record by the parties but also by reference to the circumstances upon which they rely.
25.4. That it is not necessary for the accused to come in the witness box in support of his defence,
Section 139 imposed an evidentiary burden and not a persuasive burden.
Rajaram S/O Sriramulu ... vs Maruthachalam (Since ... on 18 January, 2023
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/178346061/

25.5. It is not necessary for the accused to come in the witness box to support his defence.”
13. It can thus be seen that this Court has held that once the execution of cheque is admitted, Section
139 of the N.I. Act mandates a presumption that the cheque was for the discharge of any debt or
other liability. It has however been held that the presumption under Section 139 is a rebuttable
presumption and the onus is on the accused to raise the probable defence. The standard of proof for
rebutting the presumption is that of preponderance of probabilities. It has further been held that to
rebut the presumption, it is open for the accused to rely on evidence led by him or the accused can
also rely on the materials submitted by the complainant in order to raise a probable defence. It has
been held that inference of preponderance of probabilities can be drawn not only from the materials
brought on record by the parties but also by reference to the circumstances upon which they rely.
14. In the said case, i.e. Baslingappa v. Mudibasappa (supra), the learned Trial Court, after
considering the evidence and material on record, held that the accused had raised a probable
defence regarding the financial capacity of the complainant. The accused was, therefore, acquitted.
Aggrieved thereby, the complainant preferred an appeal before the High Court. The High Court
reversed the same and convicted the accused. This Court found that unless the High Court came to a
finding that the finding of the learned Trial Court regarding financial capacity of the complainant
was perverse, it was not permissible for the High Court to interfere with the same.
15. In the present case, the accused appellant had examined Mr. Sarsaiyyn, Income Tax Officer,
Ward No.18, Circle (II) (5), who produced certified copies of the Income Tax Returns of the
complainant for the financial year 1995− 96, 1996− 97, 1997− 98 and 1998− 99. The certified copies of
the Income Tax Returns established that the complainant had not declared that he had lent Rs.3
lakh to the accused. It further established that the agricultural income also was not declared in the
Income Tax Returns.
16. The learned Trial Court further found that from the income which was shown in the Income Tax
Return, which was duly exhibited, it was clear that the complainant(s) did not have financial
capacity to lend money as alleged.
17. The appellant had also examined D.W.2− Thiru Iyyappan, Assistant Manager, City Union Bank,
Ramnagar Branch with regard to bank transactions made by the sole proprietorship firm, M/s
Brinda Engineering.
18. D.W.3− Mr. Subramaniam, Manager, Lakshmi Vilas Bank, Ganapathy Branch was also examined
on behalf of the defence. The said witness also deposed that the complainant had signed the
application form to introduce the accused to open the account in the bank.
19. D.W.4− Mr. Ganesan, Village Administrative Officer, Ganapathy Village was also examined and
he deposed that the land in S.F. No. 591/3 and 592/3 was in joint ownership, and, in the aforesaid
survey numbers, the names of 27 persons were found.

20. After analyzing all these pieces of evidence, the learned Trial Court found that the Income Tax
Returns of the complainant did not disclose that he lent amount to the accused, and that the
declared income was not sufficient to give loan of Rs.3 lakh. Therefore, the case of the complainant
that he had given a loan to the accused from his agricultural income was found to be unbelievable by
the learned Trial Court. The learned Trial Court found that it was highly doubtful as to whether the
complainant had lent an amount of Rs.3 lakh to the accused. The learned Trial Court also found that
the complaint had failed to produce the promissory note alleged to have been executed by the
accused on 25 th October 1998. After taking into consideration the defence witnesses and the
attending circumstances, the learned Trial Court found that the defence was a possible defence and
as such, the accused was entitled to benefit of doubt. The standard of proof for rebutting the
presumption is that of preponderance of probabilities. Applying this principle, the learned Trial
Court had found that the accused had rebutted the presumption on the basis of the evidence of the
defence witnesses and attending circumstances.
21. The scope of interference in an appeal against acquittal is limited. Unless the High Court found
that the appreciation of the evidence is perverse, it could not have interfered with the finding of
acquittal recorded by the learned Trial Court.
22. Insofar as the reliance placed by Mr. Prabhakar on the judgment of this Court in the case of Bir
Singh v. Mukesh Kumar (supra) is concerned, in the said case, though the accused was convicted by
the learned Trial Court, which conviction was maintained by the Appellate Court, the High Court in
its revisional jurisdiction interfered with the same and acquitted the accused. This Court found that
in exercise of revisional jurisdiction under Section 482 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973, the
High Court could not, in the absence of perversity, upset concurrent findings of fact. In any case, in
the said case, the accused had not led evidence with regard to the financial capacity of the
complainant. This Court held that once a cheque was signed and handed over by the accused, it
would attract presumption under Section 139 of the N.I. Act in the absence of any cogent evidence to
show that the cheque was not issued in the discharge of a debt.
23. In the case of Kalamani Tex and another v. P. Balasubramanian (supra), the learned Trial Court
had dismissed the complaint. In appeal, at the behest of the complainant, the same was allowed and
the accused were convicted for the offence punishable under Section 138 of the N.I. Act. In an appeal
at the behest of the original accused, this Court while affirming the order of the High Court observed
thus:
“18. Considering the fact that there has been an admitted business relationship
between the parties, we are of the opinion that the defence raised by the appellants
does not inspire confidence or meet the standard of “preponderance of probability”.
In the absence of any other relevant material, it appears to us that the High Court did
not err in discarding the appellants' defence and upholding the onus imposed upon
them in terms of Section 118 and Section 139 of NIA.”
24. It can thus be seen that in the facts of the said case, this Court found that the defence raised by
the appellants/accused did not inspire confidence or meet the standard of “preponderance of
Rajaram S/O Sriramulu ... vs Maruthachalam (Since ... on 18 January, 2023

6
probability”.
25. In the present case, we are of the considered opinion that the defence raised by the appellant
satisfies the standard of “preponderance of probability”.
26. Insofar as the reliance on the judgment of this Court in the case of Rohitbhai Jivanlal Patel v.
State of Gujarat and Anr. (supra) is concerned, in the said case, the learned Trial Court had
acquitted the accused, the High Court, in appeal, reversed the acquittal and convicted the accused
for the offence punishable under Section 138 of the N.I. Act. Affirming the order of the High Court,
this Court held that merely by denial or merely by creation of doubt, the accused cannot be said to
have rebutted the presumption as envisaged under Section 139 of the N.I. Act. This Court held that
unless cogent evidence was led on behalf of the accused in defence of his case, the presumption
under Section 139 of the N.I. Act could not be rebutted. As such, the said judgment also would not
be applicable to the facts of the present case.
27. In that view of the matter, we are further of the considered view that the High Court was not
justified in reversing the order of acquittal of the appellant.
28. That leaves us to consider the Civil Appeals. Insofar as the Civil Appeals are concerned, the High
Court, by two different judgments and orders, has reversed the judgments and orders of the learned
Trial Court dismissing the suits, thereby decreeing them. It is a settled proposition of law that the
standard of proof in criminal proceedings differs with that in civil proceedings.
29. A distinguishing fact between the criminal proceedings and the civil proceedings in the present
case is that, while in the criminal proceedings the complainant had failed to produce the promissory
notes, in the civil proceedings, the complainant had proved the promissory notes. The High Court
found that the Civil Appeals were required to be decided on the basis of the preponderance of
probabilities. The High Court found that the complainant had established that he was working as a
LIC Agent, that his father was owning extensive agricultural properties and that he was deriving
agricultural income. The High Court, on the basis of the evidence placed on record, relying on the
preponderance of probability, came to a conclusion that the plaintiff had the financial ability to lend
the sum of Rs.3 lakh as on 20 th October 1998. The High Court also found that the appellant’s wife
was not examined as a witness in the said case so as to probabilize the defence plea. The High Court
found that the best available evidence was withheld by the defendants/appellants herein and as
such, the principle of adverse inference was also applicable.
30. Though it was sought to be argued before the High Court that in view of the judgment in the
criminal proceedings, the suit(s) was also liable to be dismissed, the High Court rightly observed
that the adjudication in civil matters is based on preponderance of probabilities whereas
adjudication in criminal cases is based on the principle that the accused is presumed to be innocent
and the guilt of the accused should be proved to the hilt and the proof should be beyond all
reasonable doubt.

31. We, therefore, find no reason to interfere with the judgments and orders passed by the High
Court in the Civil Appeals. However, in the facts and circumstances of the case, we are inclined to
modify the decree. During the pendency of the proceedings before this Court, the appellants have
deposited an amount of Rs.7 lakh and Rs. 2 lakh pursuant to the orders of this Court dated 20th
February, 2009 passed in Criminal Appeal No. 1978 of 2013 (arising out of Special Leave Petition
(Criminal) No.1456 of 2009 and connected matter and dated 13th August, 2012 passed in Civil
Appeal No.10501 of 2013 (arising out of Special Leave Petition (Civil) No.23036 of 2012). The said
amount has been directed to be invested in a Fixed Deposit Receipts from time to time. We are,
therefore, of the view that, in the facts and circumstances of the present case, the decree needs to be
modified restricting it to the amount already deposited by the appellants in both the proceedings
with interest accrued thereon.
32. In the result, we pass the following order:
(i) Criminal Appeal Nos. 1978 of 2013 and 1990 of 2013 are allowed and the common judgment of
conviction dated 28th October 2008 and order of sentence dated 30th October 2008 respectively
are quashed and set aside. The judgments and orders dated 10 th July 2011 passed by the learned
Trial Court is confirmed.
(ii) Civil Appeal Nos. 10500 of 2013 and 10501 of 2013 are dismissed. However, the decrees of the
High Court are modified, thereby restricting them to the amount already deposited by the appellants
in this Court in the civil and criminal proceedings, along with interest accrued thereon.
(iii) The respondents in both the Civil Appeals would be entitled to withdraw 50% of the amount
each from the amount deposited in this Court with interest accrued upto date.
33. There shall be no order as to costs. Pending application(s), if any, shall stand disposed of.
