Appellants were also informed that their account has been declared as Non-Performing Asset (NPA)
and the Appellants were directed to clear the dues within a period of 60 days. Undisputedly, the
dues were not cleared by the Appellants and the Appellants came up before this Court by filing a
writ petition.
4. Before the learned Single Judge, the following reliefs were sought by the Appellants.
"i. Issue a writ of Certiorari in favour of the Petitioners and quash the Order dated

Mandamus and /or Certiorari in favour of the Petitioners and grant stay of proceedings as per the

Delhi, by the bank as scheduled to take place on 16.10.2020 at 1:00 PM, till the pendency of the
present proceedings and maintain status quo;"

SARFAESI Act and the bank took possession of the property by filing appropriate application under
Section 14 of the SARFAESI Act.
6. The learned Single Judge has dismissed the writ petition and the operative paragraphs of the
order passed by the learned Single Judge as contained in paragraphs 5 to 7 reads as under:
"5. The cause of action in the instant writ petition, arising from Respondent
No.2-Bank's action under Section 13(4) and Section 14 of SARFAESI Act, 2002,
cannot be examined or entertained by this Court, in light of several decisions of
Supreme Court,1 as well as this Court,2 to the effect that a writ petition in such
banking matters is not maintainable. Moreover, as has been reiterated in recent
decisions of See: Phoenix ARC Pvt. Ltd. v. Vishwa Bharti Vidya Mandir and Ors.,
2022 SCC Online SC 44, where the Supreme Court has held that where proceedings
are initiated under the SARFAESI Act, 2002 and the borrower is aggrieved by any of
the actions of the bank for which the borrower has remedy under the SARFAESI Act,
2002, no writ petition should be entertained. Also see: Authorized Officer, State Bank
of Travancore and Ors. v. Mathew K.C., 2018 SCC Online SC 55; Agarwal Tracom Pvt.
Ltd. v. Punjab National Bank and Ors., 2017 SCC Online SC 1368; General Manager,

alternative efficacious statutory remedy already lies under Section 17 of SARFAESI Act, 2002, and
thus, this Court is not the correct forum for adjudicating the instant petition.3 Thus, the present
petition is not maintainable. Moreover, Petitioner has not disclosed or demonstrated any ground
which cannot be raised before DRT under SARFAESI Act, 2002.
6. In light of the foregoing, the present writ petition is dismissed.
7. It is clarified that the Court has not examined the merits of the case. All rights and contentions of
the parties are left open."
7. The present LPA has been filed being aggrieved by the order passed by the learned Single Judge
and the learned Counsel for the Appellants has argued before this Court that on account of lockdown
owing to COVID-19 Pandemic, the Appellants were not able to pay the EMI's in time and the learned
Single Judge should have interfered with the proceedings initiated under the SARFAESI Act.
8. Various other grounds have also been raised in the LPA, however, the fact remains that the
Appellants do have a remedy under Section 17 of the SARFAESI Act. Section 17 of the SARFAESI Act
reads as under:
"17. [Application against measures to recover secured debts].--(1) Any person
(including borrower), aggrieved by any of the measures referred to in sub-section (4)
of section 13 taken by the secured creditor or his authorised officer under this
Chapter,1 [may make an application 3 See: Kanaiyalal Lalchand Sachdev & Ors. v.
State of Maharashtra and Ors., (2011) 2 SCC 782 - where the Apex Court, in
Paragraph No. 22, held that -
"We are in respectful agreement with the above enunciation of law on the point. It is
manifest that an action under Section 14 of the Act constitutes an action taken after
the stage of Section 13(4), and therefore, the same would fall within the ambit of
Section 17(1) of the Act. Thus, the Act itself contemplates an efficacious remedy for
the borrower or any person affected by an action under Section 13(4) of the Act, by
providing for an appeal before the DRT."

doubts, it is hereby declared that the communication of the reasons to the borrower

the case and evidence produced by the parties, comes to the conclusion that any of
the measures referred to in sub-section (4) of section 13, taken by the secured

thereunder, and require restoration of the management or restoration of possession,
of the secured assets to the borrower or other aggrieved person, it may, by order,--

sub-section (4) of section 13 to recover his secured debt. [(4A) Where--
(i) any person, in an application under sub-section (1), claims any tenancy or leasehold rights upon
the secured asset, the Debt Recovery Tribunal, after examining the facts of the case and evidence
produced by the parties in relation to such claims shall, for the purposes of enforcement of security
interest, have the jurisdiction to examine whether lease or tenancy,--
(a) has expired or stood determined; or
(b) is contrary to section 65A of the Transfer of Property Act, 1882 (4 of 1882); or
(c) is contrary to terms of mortgage; or
(d) is created after the issuance of notice of default and demand by the Bank under subsection (2) of

9. In the considered opinion of this Court, the learned Single Judge was justified in dismissing the
writ petition on account of availability of alternate remedy especially keeping in view the judgment
delivered by the Hon'ble Supreme Court in United Bank of India v. Satyawati Tondon and Ors.,
2010 SCC Online SC 776, M/s Trinkeshwar Developers and Ors. v.

Sanjay Sarin v. Canara Bank & Ors., 2022 SCC OnLine Del 2402.
10. This Court also does not find a reason to interfere with the action taken by the Bank under the
SARFAESI Act especially in the light of the fact that the Appellants do have an alternative efficacious
remedy under Section 17 of the SARFAESI Act. It is needless to mention that the observations made
by the learned Single Judge and by this Court shall not come in the way of the parties and the Debt
Recovery Tribunal shall decide the matter in accordance with law.
11. The appeal stands dismissed.
