DATED : 13th JULY, 2022.
P. C. :-
. By this Application, the Applicant has sought to condone the delay of 229 days in filing the Appeal.
2. The Respondent-plaintiff herein had filed a summary suit alleging non payment of Rs.1,72,770/-
against delivery of goods. The summons for judgment was allowed on 06/04/2009. Aggrieved by
this, Appeal was filed before this Hon'ble Court. The said Appeal was allowed on 16/06/2010,
subject to payment of Rs.1,00,000/- and the case was remanded for denovo consideration.
3. The summons for judgment was heard and leave was granted to the Appellant to file the written
statement subject to the deposit of P.H. Jayani 08(A) CAF129.2019.doc balance amount of
Rs.78,321/-. The Applicant did not deposit the said amount and hence, the suit came to be decreed
on 01/08/2017.
4. By this Application, the Applicant has sought to condone the delay in filing the Appeal. The
Applicant has stated that in view of demonetization, his business had come to stand still and the
Applicant had to return to his home town in Andhra Pradesh. It is stated that he had changed his
sim card and as such, his advocate was unable to contact him. The Applicant claims that he returned
to Mumbai only in the month of January, 2018. He learnt about the judgment and decree on
11/06/2018 when the officer from the City Civil Court visited his house to execute the warrant of
attachment on movable property.
4. Considering the reasons stated in the Application, which in my considered view constitute
sufficient grounds, delay is condoned subject to payment of costs of Rs.10,000/- to be paid to the
