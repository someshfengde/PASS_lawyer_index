vide his statement recorded u/s 217 (4) of the companies4ct,2073, has stated that he
was the chairman for namesake and no extensive discussions regarding financials
had taken place in the meetings of Audit committee. Since the Audit committee was
functioning under the control of Sanjay Singal, therefore, it had never highlighted the
irregularities which were going on in BPSL.
300. Thus, Sanjay signal in connivance with R.P. Goyal Member of the Audit
committee and Ex Whole-Time Director, BPSL with an intent to deceive the
shareholders/creditors and to conceal the true affairs of BPSL had misused the
structure of Audit Committee and on their instructions, the Audit committee didn�t
properly examine the financials of BPSL and placed the false financials before the
Board of Directors for its approval. The above said acts had caused misrepresentation
of financials before the creditors and shareholders and injured their interest and
therefore, Sanjay Singal and R.P. Goyal are liable to be punished u/s 447 of the
Companies Act 2013.

Submissions on behalf of the Applicant/Arun Kumar Aggarwal
11. Learned Senior Counsel for the applicant submits that the applicant enjoyed an
unblemished reputation in work place and social life and the SFIO�s case is based
upon conjectures and surmises by merely relying on allegations, without material
facts.
12. Learned Senior Counsel has made his submissions with respect to each charge as
under:
BAIL APPLN. 3178/2022 Digitally Signed By:ANITA BAITAL Signing Date:01.06.2023 16:41:24
12.1. Charge 1, Instance II: The allegation of the respondent under this heading is that the funds of
BPSL were siphoned off and shown as capital advances to various paper companies which were then
rotated and ultimately infused into BPSL or its group companies or used in purchasing of shares or
assets in the name of Sanjay Singal and his family members. Learned Senior Counsel for the
applicant submitted that the said siphoning, as per the case of the respondent was done through
various entry operators whose statements have been recorded by respondent. The attention of this
Court has been drawn to statement of various entry operators including Praveen Kumar Tavatiya
(A-54), Dilip Kumar Nahata (A-62), Praveen Kumar Agarwal, Himansu Verma (A-57), R. K. Kedia
(A-58), B.D. Agarwal (A-88), Jagdish Prasad Purohit (A-70) and Vikash Chowdhary (A-56) recorded
by respondent. It is pointed out that they have named Alkesh Sharma (A-42) as their immediate
contact person from whom they received funds through BPSL or in cash. It is submitted that these
entry operators do not name the present applicant in their statements. 12.1.1 It is submitted that the
case of the respondent is that the balance sheets and financial reports were prepared at the
Chandigarh office of the BPSL under the supervision of Amarjeet Sharma (A-43), whereas the
present applicant was working from the Delhi office. The attention of this Court has been drawn to
the various statements of Amarjeet Sharma and H.C. Verma recorded in the investigation report.
12.1.2. It is submitted that the present applicant, in his statement categorically states that he did not
verify the figures in the balance sheets and relied upon co-accused Amarjeet Sharma (A-43) for their
veracity. It was also pointed out that it is the case of the respondent itself that primary BAIL APPLN.
3178/2022 Digitally Signed By:ANITA BAITAL Signing Date:01.06.2023 16:41:24 accused Sanjay
Singal (A-36) and Aarti Singal (A-37) were the authorized signatories to the bank account of BPSL
and they gave directions for extending advances to paper companies.
12.1.3. It is argued that it is the case of the respondent that four group companies of BPSL, being
accused nos. 14, 17, 19, 30, referred to as "four front companies" in the investigation report, received
accommodation entries from several entry operators, and invested Rs. 3350.05 crores in BPSL. It is
pointed out that Sanjay Singal (A-36) and Aarti Singal (A-37), along with their children Aniket
Singal (A-38), and Priyanka Miglani (A-
39) were directors/shareholders in the said four front companies. Aniket Singal was not arrested
during investigation and was granted anticipatory bail by the learned Special Judge vide order dated
16.03.2023, and Priyanka Miglani has not been arrested. It is pointed out that Aniket Singal and
Priyanka Miglani have not even been made accused under the present charge.

12.1.4. It is argued by learned Senior Counsel on behalf of the applicant that the allegation of the
respondent that he had supplied documents to forensic auditors which did not reflect the true and
correct picture, does not, in isolation, make out an offence. The applicant in fact, assisted in the
forensic audits of BPSL by duly providing documents required by the auditors. It was submitted that
no material has been placed on record to show that the present applicant was aware of the falsity of
the said documents.
12.2 Charge 1, Instance III: The allegation of the respondent under this head is that the funds of
BPSL were siphoned off from BPSL through BAIL APPLN. 3178/2022 Digitally Signed By:ANITA
BAITAL Signing Date:01.06.2023 16:41:24 Bogus Capital Advances shown as "advances to
suppliers" to dummy entities.
12.2.1. Attention of this Court has been drawn to the fact that none of the entry-operators have
named the applicant in this regard. It is submitted that none of the entry operators name the
applicant in their statements recorded in the investigation report. One of the said entry operators,
R.K. Kedia (A-58), stated that Sanjay Singal (A-36) instructed him to keep in touch with Amarjeet
Sharma (A-43), Alkesh Sharma (A-42), and R.P. Goyal (A-41). Another such entry-operator being
Dilip Nahata (A-62), named Alkesh Sharma (A-42) as the contact person for receiving funds and
cash and for providing accommodation entries to entities of BPSL. 12.2.2. With regard to
preparation of financial statements, it is submitted by learned Senior Counsel that such statements
and balance sheets were prepared by Amarjeet Sharma (A-43), in his capacity as Executive Director
(Finance). This fact has been recorded in the investigation report, on the basis of his own
statements. It is argued on behalf of the applicant that the case of the respondent against the
applicant concerns only his signing of balance sheets and providing documents to forensic auditors,
and the same does not show his knowledge or involvement in relation to their falsity.
12.3. Charge 1, Instance IV: The allegation of the respondent under the present charge is that certain
funds siphoned off from BPSL through capital advances and advances to suppliers were used to
purchase a property situated at Worli, Mumbai through Assurity Real Estate LLP. 12.3.1. It is
submitted that there is no finding against the applicant under the present charge in the investigation
report and that the implication of BAIL APPLN. 3178/2022 Digitally Signed By:ANITA BAITAL
Signing Date:01.06.2023 16:41:24 the applicant is on the basis of self-serving statements of Sanjay
Singal (A-
36) and Aarti Singal (A-37), which have ultimately been disbelieved by the respondent. No other
employee or person implicates the applicant in the present charge.
12.3.2. The allegation of the respondent under the present charge is that funds which were siphoned
off from BPSL through capital advances and advances to suppliers were used to purchase a property
situated at Worli, Mumbai through one Assurity Real Estate LLP (A-35), a firm incorporated in the
name of Priyanka Miglani (A-39). The modus operandi alleged is to be similar to the previous
instances. It has been submitted that none of the entry operators name the applicant. Attention of
this Court has been drawn to the Statements of Dilip Nahata, Praveen Kumar Tavatiya, R.K. Kedia
and Deepak Aggarwal recorded in the investigation report, wherein it has been stated that Alkesh

11
Sharma (A-42) and Sanjay Singal were the persons, on whose request they had provided loans to
Assurity Real Estate Pvt. Ltd. and Aarti Singal in form of accommodation entries. It was pointed out
that Priyanka Miglani (A-39), one of the designated partners in Assurity Real Estate LLP, and a
direct beneficiary, was not arrested.
13. Charge 2: The present charge pertains to issuance and negotiation of LCs by BPSL. It is alleged
that bogus LCs were opened by BPSL on the basis of forged and fabricated proforma invoices and
bills of exchange, without any further underlying documents. Learned Senior Counsel submitted
that the main accused under the present charge is one Ravinder Kumar Rastogi, Vice President
(A-46) who gave a confessional statement and was directly involved in the commission of the
offence. It is stated that he is also a director in one of the companies under investigation BAIL
APPLN. 3178/2022 Digitally Signed By:ANITA BAITAL Signing Date:01.06.2023 16:41:24 („CUIs�)
Evergrowing Iron & Finvest Pvt. Ltd. (A-4). Attention of this Court has been drawn to the fact that
despite the aforesaid, Ravinder Kumar Rastogi (A-46) was not arrested by the respondent even
though he had no protection from any Court. Another accused, namely, Ankur Nagar (A-80),
consultant for LC Discounting, who also allegedly played a crucial role and arranged false and
fabricated documents for the opening of such bogus LCs, implicated Ravinder Kumar Rastogi by
stating that he was approached by the latter for such purposes, but did not name the applicant
anywhere in his statements on record in the investigation report. Ankur Nagar was also not arrested
by the respondent. 13.1. It was submitted on behalf of the applicant that Ravinder Kumar Rastogi
(A-46) also stated that the banks were aware of the bogus nature of the LCs and they also wanted to
avoid the account from becoming an NPA, by regularizing them. However, the respondent has only
vaguely referred to the role of bankers in the investigation report and no bank or banker was
arraigned as an accused in the present case. Attention of this Court has also been drawn to the „Gist
of Statements of Bankers� in the investigation report, wherein it is stated that R.K. Rastogi used to
come to the branches, and the applicant has not been named.
14. Charges 3 & 4: The investigation report alleges cheating and fraudulent inducement of banks.
The learned Senior Counsel for the applicant has submitted that the present charge is an extension
of the previous charges and alleges that financial statements and balance sheets of BPSL which did
not reflect a true and fair picture of the affairs of the company were used to induce banks to sanction
loans to BPSL. It is reiterated that the applicant did not have knowledge of the capital BAIL APPLN.
3178/2022 Digitally Signed By:ANITA BAITAL Signing Date:01.06.2023 16:41:24 advances and
advance to suppliers as being bogus. There is no evidence linking the applicant to the present
charge.
14.1. It is argued that the applicant had neither worked in the capacity of Chief Financial Officer
(„CFO�), nor given any responsibility associated with the position and was just a namesake CFO or
Key Managerial Personnel („KMP�) as no board resolution was passed in his name by the Board of
Directors. He had never been at the forefront of any alleged activities rendering his arraignment by
SFIO in the capacity of CFO as incorrect.
15. Charges 7 & 8: Learned Senior Counsel has submitted that allegations under Charges no. 7 and 8
pertain to making false representation in the financials for the financial year 2017-18 and
Arun Kumar Aggarwal vs Serious Fraud Investigation ... on 1 June, 2023

falsification of books of accounts. It has been submitted that the balance sheets and financial reports
of BPSL were prepared at the Chandigarh office of BPSL, under the supervision of Amarjeet Sharma
(A-43), as per the case of respondent itself, the applicant was working out of the Delhi office of
BPSL.
15.1. It has been submitted that the applicant did not verify the figures in the balance sheets and he
relied on Amarjeet Sharma (A-43), who prepared them. It is submitted that Amarjeet Sharma
(A-43) was the Vice President, Finance, BPSL and his department in Chandigarh looked after the
day-to-day banking operations including LCs/BGs/fund management and payments related to
properties of BPSL as well as the minutest material decisions like finalization of accounts,
preparation of balance sheet and any other finance related matters.
BAIL APPLN. 3178/2022 Digitally Signed By:ANITA BAITAL Signing Date:01.06.2023 16:41:24
15.2. Learned Senior Counsel on behalf of the applicant submitted that, charge 6 relates to the
destruction of SAP/ERP data in 2017, to falsify the balance sheets of the company and the applicant
has not been named as an accused in the said charge.
16. Charge 10: In response to Charge no. 10 of the report alleging other fraudulent transactions,
learned Senior Counsel submitted that the allegation under the present charge is that one Narender
Kumar Jain (A-
71), entry operator, had given accommodation entries to BPSL in the form of infusion of share
capital in CUIs. Pertinently, Narender Kumar Jain does not name the applicant, and in his
statements mentions that Alkesh Sharma (A-42) used to provide cash and directions for providing
such accommodation entries. There is no specific finding against the applicant under the present
charge, neither in the investigation report nor in the complaint filed by the respondent.
17. Charge 11: Learned Senior Counsel has submitted that the present charge has not been alleged
against the applicant. The allegations under the said charge are that the audit committee was not
functioning independently. The audit committee of BPSL consisted of three members, namely, Anil
S. Supanekar, R.P. Goyal (A-41) and one Dinesh Kumar Behal. It is alleged that the same was
misused and manipulated by Sanjay Singal (A-36) and R.P. Goyal (A-41). It has been submitted that
the applicant did not attend any of the board meetings or meetings of the audit committee. Reliance
is placed on the statement of Anil S. Supanekar, an audit committee member, who does not name
the applicant in any manner. 17.1. It is further submitted that by alleging that the audit committee
was not functioning independently and committee members were merely BAIL APPLN. 3178/2022
Digitally Signed By:ANITA BAITAL Signing Date:01.06.2023 16:41:24 following the instructions of
Sanjay Singal and R.P. Goyal, the respondent itself admits that there were no detailed discussions
regarding the financials of the company in the audit committee meetings. The same clearly
corroborates the contention of the applicant that majority of the activities were directly controlled
by Sanjay Singal, and he was not involved in the preparation or verification of financial
statements/balance sheets.

18. Learned Senior Counsel appearing on behalf of the applicant submitted that the applicant has
been in judicial custody since 24.03.2022 in the aforementioned case, even after joining the
investigation more than twenty times, conforming to the summons received from time to time. On
19.05.2022, SFIO filed the prosecution complaint under Section 447 of the Companies Act. The
Learned Special Court, in order dated 19.05.2022, has recorded as under:
"Documents contained in nine trunks have been also filed along with the complaint"
Therefore, it is submitted that as per the provisions of Section 439 of the CrPC, the applicant
deserves bail to prevent interference with personal liberty of the applicant as there will be a delay in
trial, owing to the voluminous documents. To support the said contention, learned Senior Counsel
for the applicant placed reliance on 'Jainam Rathod v. State of Haryana &Anr., Criminal Appeal No.
640 of 2022� and 'Sujay Desai v. SFIO, Criminal Appeal No. 1023 of 2022.'
19. Furthermore, it is submitted that the applicant satisfies the „triple test� for grant of bail as there
is no possibility of him tampering with evidence, influencing the witnesses or fleeing from justice as
the BAIL APPLN. 3178/2022 Digitally Signed By:ANITA BAITAL Signing Date:01.06.2023 16:41:24
allegations are based solely on the prosecution�s documents, in custody of the learned Special
Court. Additionally, the statements recorded under Section 217 of the Companies Act, or any other
disclosure statements, are to be tested during trial and are not sufficient ground to deny bail.
20. Learned Senior Counsel appearing for the applicant submitted that no apprehension of
tampering with evidence or being a flight risk exists as the applicant is a permanent law-abiding
citizen of Noida, Uttar Pradesh, India who has deep roots in society and is ready to abide by all
conditions, if required, while granting regular bail as prayed for. It is the argument of the applicant
that the insistence on rigours of Section 212(6) of the Companies Act, would be contrary to the
presumption of innocence, which is a cardinal principal of criminal law.
21. In support of his arguments, learned Senior Counsel placed reliance on the following judgments:
21.1. In Ranjitsing Brahmajeetsing Sharma v. State of Maharashtra and Anr., (2005) 5 SCC 294, it
was held as under:
"35. Presumption of innocence is a human right. (See Narendra Singh v. State of M.P.
[(2004) 10 SCC 699: 2004 SCC (Cri) 1893] , SCC para 31.) Article 21 in view of its
expansive meaning not only protects life and liberty but also envisages a fair
procedure. Liberty of a person should not ordinarily be interfered with unless there
exist cogent grounds therefore. Sub-Section (4) of Section 21 must be interpreted
keeping in view the aforementioned salutary principles. Giving an opportunity to the
Public Prosecutor to oppose an application for release of an accused appears to be
reasonable restriction but clause (b) of sub-Section (4) of Section 21 must be given a
proper meaning.

14
36. Does this statute require that before a person is released on bail, the court, albeit prima facie,
must come to the conclusion that he is not guilty of such offence? Is it necessary for the court to
record such BAIL APPLN. 3178/2022 Digitally Signed By:ANITA BAITAL Signing Date:01.06.2023
16:41:24 a finding? Would there be any machinery available to the court to ascertain that once the
accused is enlarged on bail, he would not commit any offence whatsoever?
37. Such findings are required to be recorded only for the purpose of arriving at an objective finding
on the basis of materials on record only for grant of bail and for no other purpose.
38. We are furthermore of the opinion that the restrictions on the power of the court to grant bail
should not be pushed too far. If the court, having regard to the materials brought on record, is
satisfied that in all probability he may not be ultimately convicted, an order granting bail may be
passed. The satisfaction of the court as regards his likelihood of not committing an offence while on
bail must be construed to mean an offence under the Act and not any offence whatsoever be it a
minor or major offence. If such an expansive meaning is given, even likelihood of commission of an
offence under Section 279 of the Penal Code, 1860 may debar the court from releasing the accused
on bail. A statute, it is trite, should not be interpreted in such a manner as would lead to absurdity.
What would further be necessary on the part of the court is to see the culpability of the accused and
his involvement in the commission of an organized crime either directly or indirectly. The court at
the time of considering the application for grant of bail shall consider the question from the angle as
to whether he was possessed of the requisite mens rea. Every little omission or commission,
negligence or dereliction may not lead to a possibility of his having culpability in the matter which is
not the sine qua non for attracting the provisions of MCOCA. A person in a given situation may not
do that which he ought to have done. The court may in a situation of this nature keep in mind the
broad principles of law that some acts of omission and commission on the part of a public servant
may attract disciplinary proceedings but may not attract a penal provision.
xxx
44. The wording of Section 21(4), in our opinion, does not lead to the conclusion that the court must
arrive at a positive finding that the applicant for bail has not committed an offence under the Act. If
such a construction is placed, the court intending to grant bail must arrive at a finding that the
applicant has not committed such an offence. In such an event, it will be impossible for the
prosecution to obtain a judgment of conviction of the applicant. Such cannot be the intention of the
BAIL APPLN. 3178/2022 Digitally Signed By:ANITA BAITAL Signing Date:01.06.2023 16:41:24
legislature. Section 21(4) of MCOCA, therefore, must be construed reasonably. It must be so
construed that the court is able to maintain a delicate balance between a judgment of acquittal and
conviction and an order granting bail much before commencement of trial. Similarly, the court will
be required to record a finding as to the possibility of his committing a crime after grant of bail.
However, such an offence in futuro must be an offence under the Act and not any other offence.
Since it is difficult to predict the future conduct of an accused, the court must necessarily consider
this aspect of the matter having regard to the antecedents of the accused, his propensities and the
nature and manner in which he is alleged to have committed the offence.
Arun Kumar Aggarwal vs Serious Fraud Investigation ... on 1 June, 2023
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/152750508/

45. It is, furthermore, trite that for the purpose of considering an application for grant of bail,
although detailed reasons are not necessary to be assigned, the order granting bail must
demonstrate application of mind at least in serious cases as to why the applicant has been granted or
denied the privilege of bail.
46. The duty of the court at this stage is not to weigh the evidence meticulously but to arrive at a
finding on the basis of broad probabilities. However, while dealing with a special statute like
MCOCA having regard to the provisions contained in sub-Section (4) of Section 21 of the Act, the
court may have to probe into the matter deeper so as to enable it to arrive at a finding that the
materials collected against the accused during the investigation may not justify a judgment of
conviction. The findings recorded by the court while granting or refusing bail undoubtedly would be
tentative in nature, which may not have any bearing on the merit of the case and the trial court
would, thus, be free to decide the case on the basis of evidence adduced at the trial, without in any
manner being prejudiced thereby.
47. In Kalyan Chandra Sarkar v. Rajesh Ranjan [(2004) 7 SCC 528 : 2004 SCC (Cri) 1977] this Court
observed : (SCC pp. 537-38, para
18) "18. We agree that a conclusive finding in regard to the points urged by both the sides is not
expected of the court considering a bail application. Still one should not forget, as observed by this
Court in the case Puran v. Rambilas [(2001) 6 SCC 338 : 2001 SCC (Cri) 1124] : (SCC p. 344, para 8)
„Giving reasons is different from discussing merits or demerits. At the stage of granting bail a
detailed examination of evidence BAIL APPLN. 3178/2022 Digitally Signed By:ANITA BAITAL
Signing Date:01.06.2023 16:41:24 and elaborate documentation of the merits of the case has not to
be undertaken. ... That did not mean that whilst granting bail some reasons for prima facie
concluding why bail was being granted did not have to be indicated.� We respectfully agree with the
above dictum of this Court. We also feel that such expression of prima facie reasons for granting bail
is a requirement of law in cases where such orders on bail application are appealable, more so
because of the fact that the appellate court has every right to know the basis for granting the bail.
Therefore, we are not in agreement with the argument addressed by the learned counsel for the
accused that the High Court was not expected even to indicate a prima facie finding on all points
urged before it while granting bail, more so in the background of the facts of this case where on facts
it is established that a large number of witnesses who were examined after the respondent was
enlarged on bail had turned hostile and there are complaints made to the court as to the threats
administered by the respondent or his supporters to witnesses in the case. In such circumstances,
the Court was duty-bound to apply its mind to the allegations put forth by the investigating agency
and ought to have given at least a prima facie finding in regard to these allegations because they go
to the very root of the right of the accused to seek bail. The non- consideration of these vital facts as
to the allegations of threat or inducement made to the witnesses by the respondent during the
period he was on bail has vitiated the conclusions arrived at by the High Court while granting bail to
the respondent. The other ground apart from the ground of incarceration which appealed to the
High Court to grant bail was the fact that a large number of witnesses are yet to be examined and
there is no likelihood of the trial coming to an end in the near future. As stated hereinabove, this
ground on the facts of this case is also not sufficient either individually or coupled with the period of
Arun Kumar Aggarwal vs Serious Fraud Investigation ... on 1 June, 2023

16
incarceration to release the respondent on bail because of the serious allegations of tampering with
the witnesses made against the respondent."
21.2. The Hon'ble Supreme Court, in Vijay Madanlal Choudhary and Ors. v. Union of India & Ors.,
(2022 SCC Online SC 929), after BAIL APPLN. 3178/2022 Digitally Signed By:ANITA BAITAL
Signing Date:01.06.2023 16:41:24 examining the ratio in Ranjitsing Brahmajeetsing Sharma (supra)
held as under:
"401. We are in agreement with the observation made by the Court in Ranjitsing
Brahmajeetsing Sharma. The Court while dealing with the application for grant of
bail need not delve deep into the merits of the case and only a view of the Court based
on available material on record is required. The Court will not weigh the evidence to
find the guilt of the accused which is, of course, the work of Trial Court. The Court is
only required to place its view based on probability on the basis of reasonable
material collected during investigation and the said view will not be taken into
consideration by the Trial Court in recording its finding of the guilt or acquittal
during trial which is based on the evidence adduced during the trial. As explained by
this Court in Nimmagadda Prasad, the words used in Section 45 of the 2002 Act are
"reasonable grounds for believing" which means the Court has to see only if there is a
genuine case against the accused and the prosecution is not required to prove the
charge beyond reasonable doubt.
402. Sub-Section (6) of Section 212 of the Companies Act imposes similar twin
conditions, as envisaged under Section 45 of the 2002 Act on the grant of bail, when
a person is accused of offence under Section 447 of the Companies Act which
punishes fraud, with punishment of imprisonment not less than six months and
extending up to 10 years, with fine not less than the amount involved in the fraud,
and extending up to 3 times the fraud. The Court in Nittin Johari, while justifying the
stringent view towards grant of bail with respect to economic offences held that-
"24. At this juncture, it must be noted that even as per Section 212(7) of the
Companies Act, the limitation under Section 212(6) with respect to grant of bail is in
addition to those already provided in the CrPC. Thus, it is necessary to advert to the
principles governing the grant of bail under Section 439 of the CrPC. Specifically,
heed must be paid to the stringent view taken by this Court towards grant of bail with
respect of economic offences. In this regard, it is pertinent to refer to the following
observations of this Court in Y.S. Jagan Mohan Reddy.
xxx BAIL APPLN. 3178/2022 Digitally Signed By:ANITA BAITAL Signing
Date:01.06.2023 16:41:24 "34. Economic offences constitute a class apart and need to
be visited with a different approach in the matter of bail. The economic offences
having deep-rooted conspiracies and involving huge loss of public funds need to be
viewed seriously and considered as grave offences affecting the economy of the
country as a whole and thereby posing serious threat to the financial health of the
Arun Kumar Aggarwal vs Serious Fraud Investigation ... on 1 June, 2023

17
country.
35. While granting bail, the court has to keep in mind the nature of accusations, the
nature of evidence in support thereof, the severity of the punishment which
conviction will entail, the character of the accused, circumstances which are peculiar
to the accused, reasonable possibility of securing the presence of the accused at the
trial, reasonable apprehension of the witnesses being tampered with, the larger
interests of the public/State and other similar considerations."
(emphasis supplied)
403. This Court has been restating this position in several decisions, including
Gautam Kundu and Amit Kumar. Thus, while considering the application for bail
under Section 45 of the 2002 Act, the Court should keep in mind the abovementioned
principles governing the grant of bail. The limitations on granting bail as prescribed
under Section 45 of the 2002 Act are in addition to the limitations under the 1973
Code.
404. As aforementioned, similar twin conditions have been provided in several other special
legislations validity whereof has been upheld by this Court being reasonable and having nexus with
the purposes and objects sought to be achieved by the concerned special legislations. Besides the
special legislation, even the provisions in the general law, such as 1973 Code stipulate compliance of
preconditions before releasing the accused on bail. The grant of bail, even though regarded as an
important right of the accused, is not a mechanical order to be passed by the Courts. The prayer for
grant of bail even in respect of general offences, have to be considered on the basis of objective
discernible judicial parameters as delineated by this Court from time to time, on case-to-case basis."

21.3. Similarly in Anil Vasantrao Deshmukh v. State of Maharashtra., 2022 SCC Online Bom 3150
while examining the ration in Ranjitsing Brahmajeetsing Sharma (supra) and Vijay Madanlal
(supra) held as under:
"37. The aforesaid pronouncements, thus, indicate that the statutory restrictions in
the matter of grant of bail are required to be considered reasonably. A finding that
the accused is not guilty of the offence and that he is not likely to commit an offence if
released on bail, are required to be recorded only for the purpose of arriving at an
objective finding on the strength of the material on record to assess the entitlement
for bail only. If the Court having regard to the material brought on record is satisfied
that, in all probability, the accused may not be ultimately convicted, an order
granting bail may be passed. Conversely, it is not peremptory that the Court must
arrive at a positive finding that the Applicant has not committed an offence under the
Act. Likewise, a satisfaction that the accused is not likely to commit an offence while
on bail is qua the offence of the kind with which the accused is charged and not any
other offence."

21.4. In Jainam Rathod v. State of Haryana, 2022 SCC OnLine SC 1506, it was held as under:
"7. The appellant is in custody since 28 August 2019. 187 accused are named in the
criminal case by the prosecution. It is stated in the counter affidavit that all except 27
of them have appeared. It is evident that even as regards the balance, proclamation
proceedings are intended to be initiated pursuant to the order of the Special judge
dated 25 March 2022. The proceedings are now listed before the Special Judge in
July 2022.
8. In this backdrop, in the absence of a fair likelihood of the trial being completed
within a reasonable period, this Court must be mindful of the need to protect the
personal liberty of the accused in the face of a delay in the conclusion of the trial. We
are inclined to grant bail on the above ground having regard to the fact that the
appellant has been in custody since 28 August 2019. In Nittin Johari (supra), this
Court has held:
"24. At this juncture, it must be noted that even as per Section 212(7) of the
Companies Act, the limitation under Section BAIL APPLN. 3178/2022 Digitally
Signed By:ANITA BAITAL Signing Date:01.06.2023 16:41:24 212(6) with respect to
grant of bail is in addition to those already provided in CrPC. Thus, it is necessary to
advert to the principles governing the grant of bail under Section 439 of CrPC.
Specifically, heed must be paid to the stringent view taken by this Court towards
grant of bail with respect of economic offences."
9. While the provisions of Section 212(6) of the Companies Act 2013 must be borne in
mind, equally, it is necessary to protect the constitutional right to an expeditious trial
in a situation where a large number of accused implicated in a criminal trial would
necessarily result in a delay in its conclusion. The role of the appellant must be
distinguished from the role of the main accused."
21.5. The Hon'ble Supreme Court in Sujay U. Desai v. Serious Fraud Investigation Office (2022 SCC
OnLine SC 1507), held as under:
"7. Having duly considered the provisions of Section 212(6) of the Companies Act
2013, we are of the view that in the facts of the present case, the appellant ought to be
granted the benefit of bail under Section 439 of the Code of Criminal Procedure 1973
since the right to an expeditious trial is protected under Article 21 of the Constitution.
We accordingly direct that the appellant shall be released on bail, subject to such
terms and conditions, as may be imposed by the Sessions Judge, Kanpur in
connection with Sessions Trial No 577 of 2020.
21.6. The Hon'ble Supreme Court, in Gurbaksh Singh v. CBI & Anr (1980) 2 SCC 565, held as under:

"27. It is not necessary to refer to decisions which deal with the right to ordinary bail
because that right does not furnish an exact parallel to the right to anticipatory bail.
It is, however, interesting that as long back as in 1924 it was held by the High Court
of Calcutta in Nagendra v. King-Emperor [AIR 1924 Cal 476, 479, 480 : 25 Cri LJ
732] that the object of bail is to secure the attendance of the accused at the trial, that
the proper test to be applied in the solution of the question whether bail should be
granted or refused is whether it is probable that the party will appear to take his trial
and that it is indisputable that bail is not to be withheld as a punishment. In two
other cases which, significantly, are the „Meerut Conspiracy cases� observations are
to be found regarding the right to bail which deserve a special mention. In BAIL
APPLN. 3178/2022 Digitally Signed By:ANITA BAITAL Signing Date:01.06.2023
16:41:24 K.N. Joglekar v. Emperor [AIR 1931 All 504 : 33 Cri LJ 94] it was observed,
while dealing with Section 498 which corresponds to the present Section 439 of the
Code, that it conferred upon the Sessions Judge or the High Court wide powers to
grant bail which were not handicapped by the restrictions in the preceding Section
497 which corresponds to the present Section 437. It was observed by the court that
there was no hard and fast rule and no inflexible principle governing the exercise of
the discretion conferred by Section 498 and that the only principle which was
established was that the discretion should be exercised judiciously. In Emperor v.
Hutchinson [AIR 1931 All 356, 358 : 32 Cri LJ 1271] it was said that it was very
unwise to make an attempt to lay down any particular rules which will bind the High
Court, having regard to the fact that the legislature itself left the discretion of the
court unfettered. According to the High Court, the variety of cases that may arise
from time to time cannot be safely classified and it is dangerous to make an attempt
to classify the cases and to say that in particular classes a bail may be granted but not
in other classes. It was observed that the principle to be deduced from the various
Sections in the Criminal Procedure Code was that grant of bail is the rule and refusal
is the exception. An accused person who enjoys freedom is in a much better position
to look after his case and to properly defend himself than if he were in custody. As a
presumably innocent person he is therefore entitled to freedom and every
opportunity look after his own case. A presumably innocent person must have his
freedom to enable him to establish his innocence."
21.7. A coordinate bench of this Court in Bindu Rana v. Serious Fraud Investigation Office, 2023
SCC Online Del 276 held as under:
"41. The economic offences are considered under the category of grave offences and is
a factor which has to be kept in mind in addition to the triple test which is normally
applied while considering the application for grant of bail.
42. It is, however, equally true that only because the allegations are one of the grave
economic offences, it is not a rule that the bail has to be denied in every case. Every
application has to be considered on its own merits and considering the factors which
are relevant for the said case. The basic test, as reiterated by the Hon'ble Apex Court

from time to time, remains the same being:
(i) the chances of tampering with the documents and evidence, BAIL APPLN. 3178/2022 Digitally
Signed By:ANITA BAITAL Signing Date:01.06.2023 16:41:24
(ii) the chances of influencing the witness, and
(iii) the flight risk.
43. It is not in dispute that the investigation in the present case is already complete, which has
culminated into a criminal complaint filed before the concerned Special Court...
47. From the perusal of the complaint, it is apparent that even in relation to the charges which are
alleged against the present applicant, there are various other accused persons who have been named
as co- accused. The role assigned to them at this stage is no different than the Applicant. However,
surprisingly the SFIO did not feel any need or ground to arrest those co-accused persons and
proceeded to file the complaint praying the learned Special Court to take cognizance of the offences.
48. The investigation, even though is stated to have started in the year 2018, the applicant was
called on few occasions in the year 2020, then in February 2021 and thereafter information was
sought from the applicant in July and September, 2022 and she was ultimately arrested on
14.10.2022.
xxx
55. All these aspects and the veracity of the allegations in my opinion would be considered during
the course of trial and are not required to be commented upon at this stage. At this stage the
Applicant does not appear to be the beneficiary of the alleged fraud. The allegation is that the
Applicant helped in siphoning of some part of the amount from the companies under investigation...
62. The very fact that the SFIO did not feel the need to keep 53 out of 55 accused persons in custody
and did not feel that their custody would be relevant in order to complete investigation, shows that it
does not apprehend any tampering with the evidence or influencing of the witnesses. From the
perusal of the complaint the role of Applicant does not appear to be graver than other co-accused
persons. In fact the same has not even been contended by SFIO during the course of arguments.
63. As reiterated by the Hon'ble Apex Court from time to time, the object of bail is neither punitive
nor preventive and deprivation of liberty must be considered as a punishment."

Additional Sessions Judge - 03/Special judge (Companies Act), Dwarka Court, New Delhi.
23. Learned CGSC advanced detailed arguments pertaining to each charge as under:
23.1. Charge 1, Instance II: It has been submitted that the present charge pertains to commission of
fraud with the intent to injure interest of the company and is punishable under Section 447 of the
Companies Act. The investigation established that Sanjay Singal (A-36), his wife Aarti Singal (A-37)
and his associates namely R.P. Goyal (A-41), H.C. Verma (A-40), Amarjeet Sharma (A-43), Alkesh
Sharma (A-42), R.K. Gupta (A-
45), Arun Kumar Agarwal (A-44) were the "directing mind and will" and evidence brought on record
established that they colluded together and were involved in dubious transactions which caused loss
to lenders and brought enrichment to themselves.
23.1.1. Learned CGSC asserted that even though the applicant says that he wasn�t involved in the
day-to-day activities of the company as regards the siphoning off funds of BPSL in the form of bogus
capital advances, he connived with Amarjeet Sharma (A-43) by using the mode of capital advances,
diverting funds to various paper companies, which were placed and layered through a web of
entities and ultimately used for infusing in BPSL as share capital, hence, routing the same as equity
or unsecured loans to related entities of BPSL. During the investigation, it was revealed that huge
amount of funds was siphoned off from BPSL from financial year 2009-10 to 2017-18. During the
examination of the balance sheet of BAIL APPLN. 3178/2022 Digitally Signed By:ANITA BAITAL
Signing Date:01.06.2023 16:41:24 BPSL for the financial year 2016-17, it was found that the
company provisioned Rs.3079.39 crores of capital advances and raw material. 23.2. Charge 1,
Instance III: It is averred that the applicant played a paramount role in the company�s affairs and
day to day working. He along with Amarjeet Sharma (A-43) assisted the forensic team of Ernst &
Young on behalf of BPSL. He signed the balance sheet for the financial year 2013-14 to 2017-18
knowing that the finances do not reflect the true and fair picture of the affairs of the BPSL.
Moreover, applicant was always at the forefront but denies his liability by claiming to be a namesake
CFO/KMP to evade the clutches of justice.
23.2.1. The present charge alleges that funds were siphoned off from BPSL also through advances to
suppliers, wherein the applicant, together with the KMPs and twenty other CUIs provisioned
doubtful advances to the tune of Rs. 471.78 crores by signing the balance sheet for financial year
2016-17 knowing that the financials do not reflect a true and fair picture of BPSL wherein provision
for advances was made and was aware that the said advances to suppliers were not genuine business
transactions and that there were no documents executed against these advances. SFIO�s
investigation revealed most directors and addresses of the receiving entities to be the same. It was
further submitted that these entities were controlled by „entry-operators�, i.e., dummy persons as
directors/proprietors.
23.3. Charge 1, Instance IV: Learned CGSC submitted that the KMPs of BPSL, including the
applicant, together with Assurity Real Estate LLP were involved in committing fraud upon BPSL by
rotating the funds through circuitous transactions and investing the same for creating an asset BAIL

APPLN. 3178/2022 Digitally Signed By:ANITA BAITAL Signing Date:01.06.2023 16:41:24 in the
form of property at Ceejay House, Worli, Mumbai in the name of Assurity Real Estate LLP. With
regard to the above, it has been submitted that in case of unsecured loans arranged from Kolkata
based companies, Alkesh Sharma, President (Accounts) BPSL Kolkata (A-42) assisted Sanjay Singal
(A-36), in managing funds through Kolkata based companies. Since the applicant plays a pivotal
role in the BPSL and its group companies, he used to look after equity infusion with Amarjeet
Sharma (A-43) and also used to attend the meetings with bankers on behalf of BPSL. He was
completely aware of the affairs of the company. Thus, the applicant alongwith other accused persons
connived with each other to commit a fraud upon BPSL.
24. Charge 2: Learned CGSC submitted that Sanjay Singal (A-36) had devised and adopted a
mechanism and knowingly connived with the applicant and other KMPs of BPSL to fraudulently
avail credit facilities from banks. Investigation established that during financial year 2014-15 and
financial year 2015-16, Sanjay Singal (erstwhile CMD of BPSL) (A-
36) knowingly connived with Ravinder Kumar Rastogi (A-46), the then Vice President of BPSL and
the applicant who was then the CFO of BPSL to get LCs issued on the basis of false documents from
banks and then, fraudulently discounted the LCs for causing wrongful gain to themselves. In
pursuance of aforesaid object, Ravinder Kumar Rastogi and the applicant were authorized by
committee on borrowings of BPSL, in its meeting on 26.06.2013, to open the LCs and execute all
related documents.
25. Charges 3 & 4: The present charges pertain to cheating banks by fraudulent inducement.
Learned CGSC submitted that during financial BAIL APPLN. 3178/2022 Digitally Signed By:ANITA
BAITAL Signing Date:01.06.2023 16:41:24 year 2009-10 to financial year 2013-14, Sanjay Singal
(erstwhile CMD of BPSL) (A-36) entered into criminal conspiracy with KMPs/employees including
the applicant (the then CFO of BPSL) to dishonestly induce the banks to sanction loans on the basis
of false financial statements and bogus infusion of equity, including funds generated through LCs
without actual supply of any materials. Investigation revealed that through four front companies a
total capital of Rs. 3689.89 Crores (equity-Rs. 2681.3l Crore and preference shares - Rs. 1008.58
Crore) had been infused into BPSL. Through this modus operandi BPSL used to maintain a healthy
debt-equity ratio and thereby dishonestly induced the banks to sanction, as well as disburse the
loans to it.
26. Charges 7 and: Learned CGSC submitted that the applicant, with other co-accused persons is
liable under Sections 129/448 read with 447 and Sections 211 and 628 of the Companies Act, 1956
on account of making false representations in the financials for the financial year 2017- 18 wherein,
Sanjay Singal (A-36), together with the applicant (the then CFO) and others were, at all material
times aware about the fact that the SAP-ERP data did not crash. Rather, a new client code was
created and the old data was deleted. Conjunctively, the financials for financial year 2017- 18 were
still signed mentioning therein crash of ERP in order to manipulate data and conceal the siphoning
of stock of approximately Rs. 1023 crores. Therefore, the aforementioned persons falsified the books
and accounts of BPSL for financial year 2017-18, by knowingly creating false documents which did
not reflect a true and fair picture of the affairs of BPSL. Hence, it was submitted that they are liable

for punishment under the abovementioned Sections of the Companies Act.
BAIL APPLN. 3178/2022 Digitally Signed By:ANITA BAITAL Signing Date:01.06.2023 16:41:24
27. Charge 10: Learned CGSC submitted that the factual matrix and findings of the investigation
with respect to the present charge revealed fraudulent transactions punishable under Section 447 of
the Companies Act. Charge 10 demonstrates how Sanjay Singal (A-36) and the applicant, with
others committed fraud upon BPSL, by way of handing over cash to Narendra Kumar Jain (A-71)
who placed and layered it thorough a web of entities controlled and managed by him. Thereafter, the
same was rotated in the group companies of BPSL namely Vintage Steel Ltd. and Olympian Finvest
Pvt. Ltd. It has been submitted though the applicant denies the presence of any specific findings
against him, his role of being responsible for handling financial matters of BPSL and raising funds
from banks has to be considered. He was instrumental in obtaining loans for BPSL from various
banks and financial institutions. An amount of Rs.37000 Crore was outstanding against such loans
as on 31.03.2017. Additionally, the applicant was an authorized signatory to the bank accounts and
he used to sign the cheques.
28. Charge 11: Learned CGSC has placed on record the statements of one Dinesh Kumar Behal,
chairman of the audit committee for financial year 2016-17, to demonstrate Charge 11 against the
applicant. It has been submitted that the applicant connived with other co-accused persons for
misusing the corporate structure of these 30 companies for commission and continuation of the
fraud. Investigation also established that the financials of these companies were knowingly
manipulated for the purpose of equity infusion into BPSL. The financials of 30 companies� for
financial year 2009-10 to 2016-2017 did not reflect a true and fair picture of its affairs. It is the
argument of the learned CGSC that in the aforesaid BAIL APPLN. 3178/2022 Digitally Signed
By:ANITA BAITAL Signing Date:01.06.2023 16:41:24 statement of Dinesh Kumar Behal it is stated
that the applicant had been a key person of BPSL and attended the audit committee meetings in the
said capacity.
28.1 It was further submitted, on the basis of the Dinesh Kumar Behal�s testimony and the
signatures of the applicant on the proceeding book of passing resolution, that it is clear that the
applicant was present in meetings of the audit committee and was the key controller of the
committee, thereby giving rise to liability under Section 447 of the Companies Act, for misuse and
fraudulent abuse of the structure of audit committee.
29. Learned CGSC submitted that the judgments cited by the applicant are not applicable to the case
at hand as the aforesaid facts clearly demonstrate the involvement of the applicant in the affairs of
BPSL, and was actively involved in the day-to-day functioning and fraudulent activities. The
applicant cannot take the plea that he was not involved. The applicant was one of the perpetrators of
the aforesaid larger conspiracy, which was ultimately used to perpetrate a massive fraud and thus,
the applicant does not deserve any discretionary relief in the nature of of bail. Even though the
applicant has claimed that he does not fail the triple test for grant of bail, Section 212 (6) of the
Companies Act, starts with a non-obstante clause and the provisions stipulated under Sections
212(6)(i) and (ii) of the Companies Act, are mandatory in nature and as such, in the facts and

24
circumstances pertaining of the present case, the applicant is not entitled to be released on bail.
30. It is further submitted that the legislative intent in prescribing a higher threshold is amply clear
from a bare perusal of the provisions of BAIL APPLN. 3178/2022 Digitally Signed By:ANITA
BAITAL Signing Date:01.06.2023 16:41:24 Section 212(6) of the Companies Act, which mandates
that the twin conditions therein be satisfied before a person accused for an offence under Section
447 of the Companies Act can be released on bail. It is also pertinent to note that Section 212(7) of
the Companies Act, provides that the limitation on granting bail, under Section 212(6) is in addition
to the limitation in the CrPC, or any other law for the time being in force, for granting the bail.
31. Attention of this Court was drawn to the fact that vide a common judgment dated 03.11.2022 in
BAIL APPLN. 2707/2022 and BAIL APPLN. 2709/2022, a coordinate bench of this Court dismissed
the bail applications filed on behalf of co-accused Amarjeet Sharma & Alkesh Sharma.
32. Since the complaint, along with the investigation report and annexures were filed within the
stipulated time frame of 60 days from the date of first judicial remand of the applicant, learned
CGSC submits that neither the general conditions for grant of bail are satisfied qua the applicant in
the instant case nor has a case been made out for grant of bail in the case of a serious economic
offence.
33. In support of his arguments, learned CGSC placed reliance on the following judgments;
33.1 The judgment in Vijay Madanlal Choudhary and Ors. v. Union of India & Ors., 2022 SCC
Online SC 929 was cited for the proposition that provisions of Section 447 read with Section 212(6)
of the Companies Act, have been upheld.
33.2. In Narcotics Control Bureau v. Mohit Aggarwal, 2022 SCC OnLine SC 891, it was held as
under:
BAIL APPLN. 3178/2022 Digitally Signed By:ANITA BAITAL Signing Date:01.06.2023 16:41:24
"18. In our opinion the narrow parameters of bail available under Section 37 of the Act, have not
been satisfied in the facts of the instant case. At this stage, it is not safe to conclude that the
respondent has successfully demonstrated that there are reasonable grounds to believe that he is not
guilty of the offence alleged against him, for him to have been admitted to bail. The length of the
period of his custody or the fact that the charge-sheet has been filed and the trial has commenced is
by themselves not considerations that can be treated as persuasive grounds for granting relief to the
respondent under Section 37 of the NDPS Act."
33.3 Reliance was placed on Serious Fraud Investigation Office v. Nittin Johari & Anr., (2019) 9 SCC
165, to demonstrate that non-arrest of other co-accused persons cannot replace the satisfaction of
the mandatory requirements under Section 212(6) of the Companies Act. 33.4 Reliance was placed
on Satender Kumar Antil v. CBI & Anr., (2021) 10 SCC 773, to contend that in case offences
punishable under special acts, including, the Companies Act, additional conditions, as laid down
therein, would be applicable.

33.5 Reliance was placed on The Directorate of Enforcement v. M. Gopal Reddy & Anr., Judgement
dated 24.02.2023 in Criminal Appeal No. 534 of 2023, to contend that in case of economic offences
which have an impact on the society, the Court must be very slow in exercising discretion in granting
bail under Section 438 of the CrPC Rejoinder On behalf of the Applicant/Arun Kumar Aggarwal
34. By way of rejoinder, it is submitted that reliance of the respondent on the statement of Dinesh
Kumar Behal to allege that the applicant was a key personnel in the audit committee meetings is
misplaced, as in the attendance registers of the board meetings and that of the meetings of the audit
committee, the name of the applicant does not BAIL APPLN. 3178/2022 Digitally Signed By:ANITA
BAITAL Signing Date:01.06.2023 16:41:24 find mention. Pertinently, the first two statements of
Dinesh Kumar Behal do not name the applicant. It is only after the arrest of the applicant on
21.03.2022 that improved statements of Dinesh Kumar Behal were recorded. It is argued that in any
case, Dinesh Kumar Behal was the chairman of the audit committee and he ought to have been
made an accused. His statements are not reliable and are currently of an unpardoned accomplice.
Reliance of the respondent on the minutes of board meetings and minutes of audit committee
meetings to show that the applicant attended such meetings is misplaced. The attendance registers
are much more reliable as they were signed by the attendees, as opposed to the minutes of the
meetings which only contained names without signatures. Analysis and Findings
35. Heard the learned counsel appearing on behalf of the parties and perused the record.
36. For the purpose of present bail application, to bring home the allegations with respect to
commission of offence under Section 447 read with Section 212(6) of the Companies Act, the
respondent SFIO relies on the ground that the applicant, a qualified chartered accountant was
associated with BPSL from the year 2000 till 2019 and he was appointed as a Chief Financial Officer
in the year 2007. It is alleged that Chief Financial Officer in terms of Section 2(19) is "Officer
including any Director, Manager or Key Managerial Personnel or any person in accordance with
whose directions or instructions, the board of directors or anyone or more of the Directors is or are
accustomed to act."
BAIL APPLN. 3178/2022 Digitally Signed By:ANITA BAITAL Signing Date:01.06.2023 16:41:24
37. The allegations with respect to the present application for commission of offence under Section
447 read with Section 212(6) of the Companies Act, are with respect to following charges: 37.1.
Charge 1 Instance II relates to siphoning of funds from BPSL through capital advances and routing
the same as equity of unsecured loans to related entities of BPSL. It is the case of respondent that
the present applicant connived with Sanjay Singal, Aarti Singal, R.P. Goel, H.C. Verma, Amarjeet
Sharma, Alkesh Sharma and R.K. Gupta in siphoning of the funds of BPSL by payments made to
parties which were not genuine. It was further argued that the present applicant signed the balance
sheets for financial year 2016-2017 knowing the finances were not reflecting a true and fair picture
of BPSL. It is further urged that the present applicant used to attend the meetings of bankers to
discuss the forensic report of Ernest & Young along with Sanjay Singal and some of his co-accused.
It is further alleged that the present applicant comes under the category of „Key Managerial
Personnel� as defined under Section 2(51) of the Companies Act. It is thus, alleged that the present

26
applicant was in a strategic position in the aforesaid company and the financial statement and
balance sheets of BPSL were fraudulently prepared and falsified by him, which were then used for
raising funds. 37.2 Under Charge I instance III, it is alleged that the funds from BPSL were siphoned
off through bogus advances to suppliers, which were Kolkata based companies/entities, having
common directors and addresses. It is alleged that these entities were not having any genuine
business and were controlled by „Entry Operators�.
BAIL APPLN. 3178/2022 Digitally Signed By:ANITA BAITAL Signing Date:01.06.2023 16:41:24
37.2.1. It is alleged in the investigation report relied upon by the respondent that the said advances
were given to various entities through entry operators. It is also alleged that four group companies
of BPSL being accused nos. 14, 17, 19 and 30, referred to as "four front companies", received
accommodation entries from several entry operators and that Sanjay Singal, Aarti Singal alongwith
their children Aniket Singal (A-38) and Priyanka Miglani (A-39) were directors/share holders in the
four companies.
37.3. Under Charge I instance IV, it is alleged that funds were siphoned from BPSL through
purchase of property at Bombay through Assurity Real Estate LLP. It is alleged that by using mode
of capital advances or advances to suppliers, cash generated through sale or theft of goods and by
rotating those funds through those companies in circuitous transaction an asset was created in form
of Ceejay House, Worli, Mumbai in the name of said Assurity Real Estate LLP. It is alleged that the
entry operators connived with the present applicant for the said purpose.
38. A perusal of the record with respect to the aforesaid allegations made under Charge 1 Instance II
with regard to the present applicant reflects that none of the entry operators through whom the
aforesaid siphoning of funds was allegedly done named the present applicant. It is part of the record
that the statements of the said entry operators named Alkesh Sharma (A-42) to be their contact
person and from whom they received funds from BPSL or in cash. It is further on record that the
balance sheet and the financial report, as per case of respondent were prepared at Chandigarh office
of BPSL under supervision of Amarjeet Sharma (A-43) and the applicant was working out of Delhi
office. It has BAIL APPLN. 3178/2022 Digitally Signed By:ANITA BAITAL Signing Date:01.06.2023
16:41:24 been the consistent stand of the present applicant in his statements to the respondent that
he did not verify the financial figure and balance sheet and relied upon the aforesaid Amarjeet
Sharma (A-43) for their veracity. Moreover, as per the role ascribed to Sanjay Singal and Aarti
Singal, it is case of the respondent that they were the authorized signatories of BPSL and had given
directions to extend advances to paper companies. 38.1. So far as the four front companies,(A-14, 17,
19 & 30) are concerned, it is pointed out that accused Aniket Singal (A-38) was not arrested during
investigation and was granted anticipatory bail by learned Special Judge and Priyanka Minglani
(A-39) has not been arrested and has not been made an accused in the present charge. It is pertinent
to note that the aforesaid co accused were direct beneficiaries being the directors of the said
companies. It is alleged that said companies received accommodation entries from several entry
operators who do not name the present applicant.
38.2. The allegation with respect to the applicant supplying documents to forensic auditors, which
did not reflect true and correct picture, has to be seen in the background of the applicant�s

27
statement as well as the other evidence referred to hereinabove in order to impute the necessary
mens rea regarding the same.
38.3. So far as Charge I Instance III is concerned, it is a matter of record again that the funds were
siphoned off and shown as advance to suppliers to dummy entities through entry operators and
directors of the paper companies. As stated herein before, none of the entry operators have named
the applicant in their statements. Pertinently, one entry operator being R.K. Kedia (A-58) states that
Sanjay Singal (A-36) instructed him to BAIL APPLN. 3178/2022 Digitally Signed By:ANITA
BAITAL Signing Date:01.06.2023 16:41:24 keep in touch with Amarjeet Sharma (A-43), Alkesh
Sharma (A-42) and R.P. Goel (A-41). Similarly, another entry operator being Dilip Nahata (A-
62) stated that Alkesh Sharma (A-42) was contact person for receiving funds and cash and providing
accommodation entries to entities of BPSL. It is the case of the respondent that financial statements
and balance sheets were prepared by Amarjeet Sharma (A-43) in his capacity as Executive Director
Finance.
38.4. Charge 1 Instance IV relates to siphoning of funds from BPSL through purchase of a property
at Mumbai through Assurity Real Estate LLP. A perusal of the investigation report with respect to
the aforesaid charge reflects that there is no finding against the present applicant. For the purpose
of this charge the fact that none of the entry operators name the present applicant would also be
relevant. Statement of entry operators named Dilip Nahata, Praveen Kumar Tavatiya, R.K. Kedia
reflect that they had provided loan to the said firm in the form of accommodation entries on the
request of Alkesh Sharma (A-42) and Sanjay Singal. However, the aforesaid company Assurity Real
Estate LLP (A-35) was a partnership firm incorporated in the name of Priyanka Miglani (A-39) as a
Partner. As stated above, the said Priyanka Miglani (A-39) was not arrested by the respondent.
39. Charge-2 relates to issuance and negotiation of LCs by BPSL. It is alleged that bogus LCs were
opened by BPSL on the basis of forged and fabricated proforma invoice, bills of exchange without
any further underlying documents. It has been pointed out that it is the case of respondent itself that
Ankur Nagar (A-46), consultant for LC discounting (A-80) had played a crucial role and arranged
false and fabricated BAIL APPLN. 3178/2022 Digitally Signed By:ANITA BAITAL Signing
Date:01.06.2023 16:41:24 documents for opening bogus LCs. However, he does not name the
present applicant but takes the name of Ravindra Kumar Rastogi, Vice President (A-46). It has been
pointed out that both the aforesaid accused persons namely Ravindra Kumar Rastogi (A-46), who as
per the case of respondent in his confessional statement admitted direct involvement in the
commission of the offence and aforesaid Ankur Nagar (A-80) have not been arrested by the
respondent.
39.1. It has been further pointed out that with reference to the gist of Banker�s statements in the
SFIO report, during examination of bankers, it has come on record that aforesaid Ravinder Kumar
Rastogi (A-46) used to come to the branches but do not name the present applicant.
40. Charge 4 relates to cheating banks by fraudulently inducing them to sanction loans to BPSL on
the basis of financial statements and balance sheets of BPSL, which did not reflect true and correct
Arun Kumar Aggarwal vs Serious Fraud Investigation ... on 1 June, 2023
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/152750508/
28
picture of the said company. It is alleged that the present applicant alongwith other accused persons
including entry operators committed frauds upon the banks to sanction loans on the basis of
financial statements which otherwise were created on the basis of modus operandi as alleged in
charge 1 instance (II, III and IV). It is alleged that the present applicant signed the financial
statements from 2014-2015 to 2016-2017. As stated hereinabove, since the statement of co-accused
persons with respect to the modus operandi as mentioned in the aforesaid instances do not name
the present applicant, therefore, signing the financial statements cannot be seen in isolation to
presume the knowledge of the same to be fraudulent at this stage. It is argued that the applicant had
neither worked in the capacity of CFO, nor BAIL APPLN. 3178/2022 Digitally Signed By:ANITA
BAITAL Signing Date:01.06.2023 16:41:24 given any responsibility of CFO and was just a namesake
CFO/KMP as no board resolution was passed in his name by the board of directors.
41. Charge 7 and 8 relate to the manipulation of balance sheets and fraudulent reports of the BPSL.
It is alleged that the present applicant being the CFO was aware of fact that the SAP/ERP data did
not crash rather new client code was created and data in the old client was deleted, but the applicant
signed the financial report for the year 2016-2017 mentioning the crash of ERP data. It is alleged
that the ERP data was manipulated only to conceal the siphoning of stock amounting to Rs. 1023
crores.
41.1. The attention of this Court has been drawn to the fact that the case of respondent was that the
said balance sheets and financial reports were prepared at Chandigarh office and the applicant was
working out of Delhi office. It was also pointed out that under charge 6 in the investigation report
related to destruction of SAP/ERP Data 2017, in order to manipulate the records of the company,
but the present applicant has not been named in the said charge as an accused.
42. Charge 10 relates to commission of fraud upon BPSL wherein it is alleged that cash was handed
over to one entry operator namely Narender Kumar Jain (A-71), who then placed and layered the
same through web of entities controlled and managed by him and subsequently rotating it in the
group companies of BPSL namely Vintage Steel Ltd and Olympian Finvest Pvt. Ltd. in form of
equity. Attention of this Court has been drawn to the statement of aforesaid Narender Kumar Jain
(A-71) wherein he does not name the applicant but states that Alkesh Sharma (A-
42) used to provide cash and directions for provisioning such entries.
BAIL APPLN. 3178/2022 Digitally Signed By:ANITA BAITAL Signing Date:01.06.2023 16:41:24
43. Charge 11 is related to misuse and fraudulent abuse of structure of audit committee. It is stated
in the SFIO investigation report that during financial year 2016-2017, there were three persons who
were part of the audit committee namely Dinesh Kumar Behal, R.P. Goel (A-41) and Anil S.
Supanekar. It is alleged, in the said report that although the board had entrusted said committee
with specific duties in terms of Section 171 of the Companies Act, with regard to correctness and
completeness of financial results but the structure of audit committee was used to perpetrate fraud.
It is the case of the respondent itself that the said committee was not functioning independently and
the committee members were following the instructions of Sanjay Singal and R.P. Goel.
Arun Kumar Aggarwal vs Serious Fraud Investigation ... on 1 June, 2023

29
43.1. Reliance was placed on statement date 30.03.2022 made by Dinesh Kumar Behal, who was
chairman of the audit committee wherein he stated that the present applicant used to attend the
meetings of the audit committee as well as board meetings and also played an active role in the said
meetings. Perusal of the record reflects that the name of the present applicant does not find mention
in the attendance register of the board meetings and that of the audit committee, placed on record
by the respondent. Reliance by respondent was placed on the Proceeding books of the company�s
minutes of meetings showing applicant�s name and signature. A perusal of the said minutes handed
up in the court shows that the signature of the applicant is not contemporaneous to the meeting.
The signature of the applicant is dated 26.03.2022 which was when he probably joined the
investigation in the case 43.2. The Attention of this Court was also drawn to the statement made by
Anil S. Supanekar, who was a member of the audit committee BAIL APPLN. 3178/2022 Digitally
Signed By:ANITA BAITAL Signing Date:01.06.2023 16:41:24 wherein he does not name the
applicant in any manner. So far as the statement of Dinesh Kumar Behal is concerned, it is pointed
out in the first two statements made by him on 13.12.2017 and 15.02.2019, the applicant was not
named. However, after the arrest of the present applicant, the statements of aforesaid Dinesh
Kumar Behal have been recorded, who in response to pointed question by the respondent has
named the present applicant. It is further pointed out that Dinesh Kumar Behal, who was the
chairman of the audit committee has not been made an accused and therefore statement made by
him is a self serving one and cannot be relied upon.
44. Perusal of the record further reveals that most of the co-accused persons in the present complain
are on bail or were not arrested. It has been pointed out that Sanjay Singal (A-46), H.C. Verma
(A-40) and R.P. Goel (A-41) have not been arrested by respondent in pursuance to interim
protection granted to them by the Hon�ble Supreme Court vide order dated 17.02.2020, passed in
Writ Petition (CRL.) 36/2020. Similarly, it has been pointed out that Aarti Singal (A-37) who was a
direct beneficiary of the alleged siphoning of funds was released on bail by learned Special Judge.
On the same lines, it has been argued that Aniket Singal (A-38), who was also a direct beneficiary
has not been arrested during trial and was granted anticipatory by learned Special Judge. The other
beneficiary Priyanka Miglani (A-39) has also not been arrested. It is further submitted that none of
the entry operators (A-53 to A-92) and other employees of BPSL (A-45 to 47) and statutory auditors
(A-48 to A-52) were never arrested by the respondent. As noted hereinbefore, Ravinder Kumar
Rastogi (A-46) and Ankur Nagar (A-80) were also not arrested.
BAIL APPLN. 3178/2022 Digitally Signed By:ANITA BAITAL Signing Date:01.06.2023 16:41:24
45. It was further submitted that the present applicant has not been charged for certain allegations
which are otherwise intrinsically linked to the involvement of inner circle of Sanjay Singal. These
charges are related to theft of material from Sambhalpur plant, sale of Chennai land and destruction
of SRP-ERP data. Finally, it has been vehemently argued upon that no material has come on record
to show that the present applicant was beneficiary of the any of the alleged siphoned funds.
46. The Supreme Court while considering the provisions of Section 37 of the NDPS Act, in Mohd.
Muslim alias Hussain v. State (NCT of Delhi), 2023 SCC Online SC 352, held as under:
Arun Kumar Aggarwal vs Serious Fraud Investigation ... on 1 June, 2023
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/152750508/
30
"19. The conditions which courts have to be cognizant of are that there are reasonable
grounds for believing that the accused is "not guilty of such offence" and that he is
not likely to commit any offence while on bail. What is meant by "not guilty" when all
the evidence is not before the court? It can only be a prima facie determination. That
places the court's discretion within a very narrow margin. Given the mandate of the
general law on bails (Sections 436, 437 and 439, CrPC) which classify offences based
on their gravity, and instruct that certain serious crimes have to be dealt with
differently while considering bail applications, the additional condition that the court
should be satisfied that the accused (who is in law presumed to be innocent) is not
guilty, has to be interpreted reasonably. Further the classification of offences under
Special Acts (NDPS Act, etc.), which apply over and above the ordinary bail
conditions required to be assessed by courts, require that the court records its
satisfaction that the accused might not be guilty of the offence and that upon release,
they are not likely to commit any offence. These two conditions have the effect of
overshadowing other conditions. In cases where bail is sought, the court assesses the
material on record such as the nature of the offence, likelihood of the accused
co-operating with the investigation, not fleeing from justice : even in serious offences
like murder, kidnapping, rape, etc. On the other hand, the court in these cases under
such special Acts, have to address itself principally on two facts: likely guilt of the
accused and the likelihood of them not committing any offence upon release. This
court has generally upheld BAIL APPLN. 3178/2022 Digitally Signed By:ANITA
BAITAL Signing Date:01.06.2023 16:41:24 such conditions on the ground that liberty
of such citizens have to - in cases when accused of offences enacted under special
laws - be balanced against the public interest.
20. A plain and literal interpretation of the conditions under Section 37 (i.e., that
Court should be satisfied that the accused is not guilty and would not commit any
offence) would effectively exclude grant of bail altogether, resulting in punitive
detention and unsanctioned preventive detention as well. Therefore, the only manner
in which such special conditions as enacted under Section 37 can be considered
within constitutional parameters is where the court is reasonably satisfied on a prima
facie look at the material on record (whenever the bail application is made) that the
accused is not guilty. Any other interpretation, would result in complete denial of the
bail to a person accused of offences such as those enacted under Section 37 of the
NDPS Act.
21. The standard to be considered therefore is one, where the court would look at the
material in a broad manner, and reasonably see whether the accused's guilt may be
proved. The judgments of this court have, therefore, emphasized that the satisfaction
which courts are expected to record, i.e., that the accused may not be guilty, is only
prima facie, based on a reasonable reading, which does not call for meticulous
examination of the materials collected during investigation (as held in Union of India
v. Rattan Malik19). Grant of bail on ground of undue delay in trial, cannot be said to
be fettered by Section 37 of the Act, given the imperative of Section 436A which is
Arun Kumar Aggarwal vs Serious Fraud Investigation ... on 1 June, 2023
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/152750508/
31
applicable to offences under the NDPS Act too (ref. Satender Kumar Antil supra).
Having regard to these factors the court is of the opinion that in the facts of this case,
the appellant deserves to be enlarged on bail."
(emphasis supplied)
47. A coordinate bench of this Court in Ashish Mittal v. SFIO vide judgment dated
03.05.2023 in BAIL APPLN. 251/2023 after exhaustively examining the law on the
case with respect to satisfaction in terms of Section 212(6) of the Companies Act, has
held as under:
"28. The above enunciation of the law clearly mandates that where additional
conditions are stipulated in a statute for grant of bail relating to specified offences; it
cannot be that the prosecution need only recite from its complaint, or simply say that
it has material BAIL APPLN. 3178/2022 Digitally Signed By:ANITA BAITAL Signing
Date:01.06.2023 16:41:24 against the accused in respect of such offences. The
prosecution must show how the material collected during investigation supports the
allegations in the complaint, and most importantly, how the allegations apply against
the accused. To reiterate, the opposition by the public prosecutor must be reasoned
opposition, supported by valid and relevant reasons. When the public prosecutor
opposes a bail plea, he would have to establish foundational facts sufficiently to
dislodge the presumption of innocence, and it is only then that the onus of satisfying
the stringent twin-conditions would shift onto the accused.
To be clear, there is no statutory mandate for the court to depart from the
presumption of innocence.
29. Coming back to the present case, Section 212(6) of the 2013 Act is actuated when the individual
is accused of committing an offence as mentioned in the said Section, viz. Section 447 of the 2013
Act. However, what is stated in a complaint or the FIR are only allegations, which may or may not be
founded on evidence or material. To borrow the words of the Supreme Court in Noor Aga (supra),
superficially a case may have an ugly look and thereby, prima facie, shaking the conscience of any
court but it is well settled that suspicion, however high it may be, can under no circumstances, be
held to be a substitute for legal evidence. Unlike cases of preventive detention, this is not a
jurisdiction of suspicion. Indeed, the more severe the punishment, the greater must be the care
taken to see that all safeguards in a statute are scrupulously followed.(State of Punjab v. Baldev
Singh, (1999) 6 SCC 172 )
30. Therefore, to assess whether the State has been able to prima- facie make-out a case against an
accused and for the additional twin conditions to apply, there must be (i) a specific allegation
against the accused; (ii) which allegation must find place in the complaint/FIR;
(iii) there must be material in support of such allegation; and (iv) the combined reading of the
material in support of the allegation must point towards the guilt of the accused as regards the
Arun Kumar Aggarwal vs Serious Fraud Investigation ... on 1 June, 2023
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/152750508/
32
relevant offence. It would be necessary to note that the bulky nature of material annexed to the
complaint is not a sufficient criteria, there must be something, as regards each specific allegation
against the accused in the complaint, which point towards the guilt of the accused of the offence
which attracts the additional twin-conditions.
31. After all, bail, not jail is the rule.(Arnab Manoranjan Goswami v. State of Maharashtra, (2021) 2
SCC 427)
32. While still on this point, it may be noticed that the 2013 Act specifically circumscribes even the
power of an SFIO officer to arrest BAIL APPLN. 3178/2022 Digitally Signed By:ANITA BAITAL
Signing Date:01.06.2023 16:41:24 an accused. Section 212(8) expressly stipulates that an arrest may
only be made by an officer of the rank of Assistant Director or above; and further stipulates
pre-conditions to making an arrest, viz. that the officer must be in possession of material, based on
which he has formed the reason to believe that the accused has committed an offence under the
2013 Act, with a further requirement that the reason for the belief are to be recorded in writing. This
adds further weight to the interpretation that the opposition offered by the prosecutor must also be
based on material in the possession of the SFIO, from which the reason to believe for arrest has
arisen, which reason must also have been recorded in writing.
33. It is also important to articulate here, that though the general principle is that parity with
co-accused alone is not a ground to claim bail as a matter of right; however, that principle is
nuanced. The nature of an offence may be such, that the fact that other accused have been granted
bail, may persuade the court to exercise its discretion in favour of another co-accused in granting
bail. (Totaram v. State of Madhya Pradesh and Anr., criminal appeal no. 1010/2023, order dated
06.04.2023(Supreme Court) "
48. In these circumstances for the limited purpose of the present application, this Court has to
examine the case of the applicant with respect to the twin conditions contained in Sections 212(6)(i)
and (ii) of the Companies Act, which are in addition to conditions for bail under Section 439 of the
CrPC As mentioned hereinabove, the foundation of the case of the respondent with respect to the
present applicant is that he was the Chief Financial Officer and being a Key Managerial Person had
signed the financial statements of the year 2013-14 to 2016-17. The entire case of the respondent is
primarily on the basis of aforesaid status of the present applicant. The material on record, by way of
statements made by the entry operators, co-accused, employees of the companies, documents
including the attendance registers of the board meetings as well as meetings of audit committee, as
noted in the preceding paragraphs, prima facie indicates to BAIL APPLN. 3178/2022 Digitally
Signed By:ANITA BAITAL Signing Date:01.06.2023 16:41:24 the contrary. Reliance placed by the
respondent on the statement made by Dinesh Kumar Behal to show that the present applicant
attended the meetings is contradictory to their own documents which are contemporaneous in
nature, which shows that the present applicant never attended the board meetings as well as audit
committee. The veracity of the statement made by aforesaid Dinesh Kumar Behal will be tested at
the time of his examination.
Arun Kumar Aggarwal vs Serious Fraud Investigation ... on 1 June, 2023
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/152750508/
33
49. It is also pertinent to note that the name of the applicant on the minutes of meeting sans his
signature prima facie vindicates his stand that he was namesake CFO. In this context, it is pertinent
to note that the case of the respondent as noted hereinabove is that the Chief Financial Officer in
terms of Section 2(19) of the Companies Act, is "Officer including any Director, Manager or Key
Managerial Personnel or any person in accordance with whose directions or instructions, the board
of directors or anyone or more of the Directors is or are accustomed to act." A plain reading of the
aforesaid provision indicates that if the board of directors has to follow the directions or instructions
of the Chief Financial Officer then the presence of the latter in such meetings would be a necessity.
In this background, the conspicuous absence of the present applicant�s name from the attendance
registers of board meetings and audit committee will have a bearing for the purposes of deciding the
present application. It is pertinent to note that while grave allegations have been made qua the
applicant with regard to connivance/conspiring with the promoters and other co accused, but no
allegation with regard to his receiving benefits have been made.
BAIL APPLN. 3178/2022 Digitally Signed By:ANITA BAITAL Signing Date:01.06.2023 16:41:24
50. Admittedly, the evidence in the present case is predominantly documentary in nature and it has
been pointed out by learned Senior Counsel, the complaint is accompanied with documents
contained in 09 trunks. It is common knowledge that the trial is likely to take a long time. The
reliance placed by the respondents on the orders with regard to co- accused Amarjeet Sharma and
Alkesh Sharma, dismissing their bail applications by a coordinate bench of this court is misplaced.
The aforesaid order of the coordinate Bench was with respect to the contention of the said
co-accused with regard to Section 167(2) of the CrPC In any case the present application is being
decided on the basis of its own facts.
51. Learned Senior Counsel has submitted that the present applicant joined the investigation on
each and every occasion as and when called by the investigating officer and it is further noted that
nothing has been brought on record by the respondent to show that the applicant is capable of
tampering with the evidence or is a flight risk. It is further noted that the present applicant was
granted interim bail during the pendency of the present bail application and he surrendered in time
without misusing the liberty granted. In the present case, in view of the discussion made herein
before, this Court is of the opinion that from the material brought on record, the requirements of
Sections 212(6)(i) and (ii) of the Companies Act, are satisfied.
52. In view of the facts and circumstances of the present case, the application is allowed and the
applicant is admitted to bail upon furnishing a personal bond in the sum of Rs. 5,00,000/-
alongwith two sureties of like amount to the satisfaction of the learned Trial Court/Link Court,
further subject to the following conditions:
BAIL APPLN. 3178/2022 Digitally Signed By:ANITA BAITAL Signing Date:01.06.2023 16:41:24 i.
In case of any change of address, the applicant is directed to inform the same to the learned Trial
Court/Investigating Officer, with a prior notice of seven days.
ii. The applicant shall not leave India without the prior permission of the learned Trial Court.

34
iii. The applicant is directed to give all his mobile numbers to the Investigating Officer and keep
them operational at all times. iv. The applicant shall not, directly or indirectly, tamper with evidence
or try to influence the witness in any manner.
v. In case it is established that the applicant tried to tamper with the evidence, the bail granted to
the applicant shall stand cancelled forthwith.
53. Needless to state, nothing mentioned hereinabove is an opinion on the merits of the case
pending before the learned Trial Court.
54. The application stands disposed of along with all the pending application(s), if any.
56. Let a copy of this judgment be communicated to the concerned Jail Superintendent.
57. Order be uploaded on the website of this Court, forthwith.
