M.R. SHAH, J.
1. As common questions of law and fact arise in this group of appeals, namely, interpretation of
Section 18 of the Securitisation and Reconstruction of Financial Assets and Enforcement of Security
Interest Act, 2002 (hereinafter referred to as the ‘SARFAESI Act’), all these Signature Not Verified
Digitally signed by Neetu Sachdeva appeals are decided and disposed of together by this common
judgment Date: 2023.01.05 16:39:17 IST Reason:
and order.
2. Feeling aggrieved and dissatisfied with the impugned judgment and order dated 22.12.2020
passed by the High Court of Delhi at New Delhi in Writ Petition (Civil) No. 6060/2020, both, the
borrower as well as the secured creditor have preferred Civil Appeal Nos. 8969 and 8970 of 2022.
3. Civil Appeal Nos. 8972, 8973 and 8974 of 2022 have been preferred against the common
impugned judgment and order dated 12.04.2022 passed by the High Court of Madhya Pradesh,
Bench at Indore in respective Writ Petition Nos. 5494/2021, 5470/2021 and 5478/2021, by which

Allahabad (for short, ‘DRAT’), by which the DRAT while entertaining the appeals under Section 18
of the SARFAESI Act held that the borrower is not liable to deposit 50% of the amount of debt as the
secured property has been sold and the amount is realised as the same was paid by the auction
purchasers and is to be appropriated towards the amount liable to be deposited as pre-deposit under
Section 18 of the SARFAESI Act. Factual aspects in Civil Appeal Nos.8969 & 8970 of 2022:
4. That the appellant in Civil Appeal No. 8969/2022 – Sidha Neelkanth Paper Industries Private
Limited (hereinafter referred to as the ‘principal borrower’) approached the Andhra Bank for
sanction of credit facility and in the year 2008, it had approached Standard Chartered Bank for
taking over the debt taken by it. In the year 2010, the Andhra Bank sanctioned open cash credit limit
for a sum of Rs. 15.5 crores in favour of the principal borrower. Immovable properties were
mortgaged by the guarantors and by the borrower to secure the said cash credit facility. After taking
over the existing cash credit facility, a further ad-hoc open cash credit to the tune of Rs. 3 crores,
due to the Standard Chartered Bank, was cleared by the Andhra Bank.
4.1 Since, the principal borrower failed to make the repayment to the Andhra Bank, its account was
declared as a Non Performing Asset (NPA). A notice dated 10.05.2013 was issued by the Andhra
Bank under Section 13(2) of the SARFAESI Act, calling upon the borrower to pay the outstanding
amount of Rs. 16,61,91,174.67 (Rupees sixteen crores sixty one lakhs ninety one thousand one
hundred seventy four and paise sixty seven only), payable as on 27.04.2013. Objections thereto were
raised by the principal borrower under Section 13(3A) of the SARFAESI Act. Since the amount
demanded was not paid under Section 13(2) of the SARFAESI Act, measures under Section 13(4) of
the SARFAESI Act were initiated by the Bank and possession of one of the mortgaged properties,
being property bearing No. 170, Deepali, Pitampura, Delhi-110034 was taken. An Appeal was filed
being SA No. 264/2013 by respondent Nos. 2 & 3 herein challenging the measures taken by the
Andhra Bank under Section 13(4) of the SARFAESI Act. 4.2 On 25.07.2013, a conditional interim
stay was granted by the Debt Recovery Tribunal-III (for short, ‘DRT’) and the applicants in SA No.
264/2013 were directed to deposit a sum of Rs. 2 crores within a period of 30 days. The said
applicants were also directed to bring a better buyer in respect of the properties in question within a
period of 60 days along with 10% of the proposed sale consideration. Since the borrower failed to
comply with the order of the DRT, the mortgaged properties were put to auction. Attempts made by
the owners of the property to challenge the proposed auction failed inasmuch as the application
moved before the DRT and the appeal preferred before the DRAT were both dismissed. The writ
petition filed by the owners before the High Court also came to be dismissed as withdrawn on
17.02.2016. That thereafter, the property in question was put to auction after getting the property
valued and obtaining a valuation report of the property in question, namely, property bearing No.
170, Deepali, Pitampura, Delhi- 110034. In the meantime, the Andhra Bank assigned all its debts
and underlying securities to Prudent ARC Limited, the appellant in Civil Appeal No. 8970/2022.
The borrower filed Writ Petition (Civil) No. 12791/2018 before the High Court challenging the
assignment of debts by Andhra Bank, which came to be dismissed by the High Court on 28.11.2018.
An intra-court appeal also came to be dismissed. 4.3 That thereafter, the borrower filed an
interlocutory application before the DRT to prevent the auction scheduled on 05.12.2018. However,
the DRT allowed the creditor/assignee to proceed with the auction. The auction was conducted on
05.12.2018 and one M/s Tejswi Impex Pvt. Ltd. (auction purchaser) was the successful highest

bidder for an amount of Rs. 12.5 crores. The entire amount was deposited and a sale certificate came
to be issued in favour of the auction purchaser on 19.12.2018.
4.4 The borrower filed an appeal before the DRAT being Appeal No. 616/2018 challenging the order
dated 05.12.2018 passed by the DRT dismissing the application filed by the borrower praying that
the Bank/assignee be restrained from proceeding with the auction. The DRAT vide order dated
20.12.2018 directed the borrower to comply with the requirements of making a pre-deposit under
Section 18 of the SARFAESI Act. The said order was in the nature of an interim order. The order
dated 20.12.2018 passed by the DRAT was challenged before the High Court by way of Writ Petition
No. 14066/2018. 4.5 The High Court directed the DRAT to hear the appeal on merits by observing
that on realising the amount of Rs. 12.5 crores against the debt of Rs. 16.61 crores, it can be said that
more than 50% of the debt due is secured/recovered and therefore the requirement of making a pre-
deposit under the second proviso to Section 18 of the SARFAESI Act can be said to have been met.
That thereafter, the DRAT disposed of the appeal vide order dated 1.8.2019 with a direction to the
DRT to dispose of the main Securitization Application within a period of three months.
Subsequently, vide order dated 05.10.2019, the DRT dismissed SA No. 264/2013 filed by
respondent Nos. 2 & 3 herein. Against the said order, the borrower and the owner of the mortgaged
property filed Regular Appeal No. 467/2019. The borrower sought waiver of the statutory
pre-deposit under Section 18 of the SARFAESI Act, relying on the earlier order dated 26.12.2018
passed in Writ Petition No. 14066/2018 and contending, inter alia, that as Rs. 12.5 crores had
already been recovered/realised by selling the mortgaged property and the same had been deposited
by the auction purchaser, which can be said to be more than 50% of the debt of Rs. 16.61 crores and
therefore the borrower is not required to pay any further amount towards the pre- deposit as
envisaged under Section 18 of the SARFAESI Act. The DRAT allowed the waiver of the statutory
pre-deposit by observing that the amount already realised by selling the mortgaged
property/secured property is required to be adjusted towards the pre-deposit and/or the same can
be said to be a deposit of 50% of the amount as pre-deposit, as envisaged under Section 18 of the
SARFAESI Act.
4.6 Feeling aggrieved and dissatisfied with the order passed by the DRAT allowing waiver of the
statutory pre-deposit on the aforesaid ground, the secured creditor/assignee filed the subject writ
petition before the High Court being Writ Petition No. 6060/2020. By the impugned judgment and
order, the High Court has partly allowed the said writ petition preferred by the secured
creditor/assignee by directing that the borrower is required to deposit 50% of the remaining 4.1
crores being debt due (after deducting/adjusting Rs. 12.5 crores realised/recovered by selling the
mortgaged property). The High Court has also observed that it shall be open to DRAT to reduce the
said pre- deposit amount to 25%, after recording reasons in writing for the said reduction. The
aforesaid order is passed by the High Court, after observing and concluding as under:
“(a) Pre-deposit contemplated under the second proviso of Section 18 of the
SARFAESI Act, 2002 is mandatory in nature and cannot be waived by the learned
DRAT.

(b) While computing the “amount of debt due”, the amount of debt claimed by he
secured creditor in its notice issued under Section 13(2) of the Act, shall be relevant
and any future interest need not be taken into consideration for purposes of
determining, “the amount of debt due as claimed by the secured credit”, in cases
where the DRT has not determined the liability of a borrower.
(c) The interest component shall be ignored only for the purposes of Section 18 of the
Act. This judgment shall not affect the rights of the secured creditors to claim interest
from the borrower, for recovery of amounts due under the RDDB Act.
(d) Any amount that has been repaid by the borrower and/or recovered by a secured creditor after
filing of the petition under Section 17, shall stand to the benefit of the borrower while computing the
”amount of debt due” under the second proviso to Section 18 of the SARFAESI Act, 2002.” 4.7
Feeling aggrieved and dissatisfied with the impugned judgment and order passed by the High Court,
both, the secured creditor/assignee – Prudent ARC Limited and the original borrower – Sidha
Neelkanth Paper Industries Pvt. Ltd. have preferred the present appeals. Factual Aspects in Civil
Appeal Nos.8972, 8973 & 8974 of 2022:
5. That the respective respondents in the present appeals took financial assistance by way of a Home
Loan to the tune of Rupees one crore fifty lakhs from Bank of Baroda – the financial creditor. In
order to secure the loan, the borrowers had mortgaged their property situated at Survey No.
542/2/2/1, Patwari Halka No. 18, Junior Dewas, District Dewas. Upon committing the default in
returning the loan amount, the Bank issued a demand notice dated 3.8.2019 under Section 13(2) of
the Securitisation and Reconstruction of Financial Assets and Enforcement of Security Interest Act,
2002 (hereinafter referred to as the ‘SARFAESI Act’) for a debt of Rs. 1,40,81,936/-. A possession
notice was issued on 10.10.2019. The borrowers approached the DRT by filing SA No. 652/2019. The
bank withdrew the said notice and issued a fresh notice dated 13.1.2020 under Section 13(2) of the
SARFAESI Act for the outstanding amount of Rs. 1,40,81,936/- from the borrowers. That thereafter
the bank published the possession notice in daily newspapers on 24.03.2020. Subsequently, the
bank issued a sale notice under Section 8(6) of the Security Interest Enforcement Rules, 2002 and
put the mortgaged property to auction on 17.08.2020.
5.1 The borrowers again approached the DRT by way of SA No. 240/2020 on 14.08.2020. The bank
conducted the auction proceedings on 17.08.2020 in which the appellants herein – original writ
petitioners before the High Court, as one of the bidders, was declared as a successful highest bidder,
having bid of Rs. 1,55,10,000/-. That thereafter the auction purchaser deposited the entire bid
amount. The sale in favour of the auction purchaser came to be finalised and the sale certificate was
registered on 23.11.2020 in favour of the auction purchaser and he was put in possession of the
secured asset. 5.2 Vide order dated 13.11.2020, the DRT dismissed SA No. 240/2020. Being
aggrieved by the order dated 13.11.2020 passed by the DRT, the borrower approached the DRAT by
way of Appeal No.344/2020 along with an application seeking waiver of the pre-deposit of the
amount under Section 18 of the SARFAESI Act. By order dated 9.2.2021, the DRAT held that as the
bank had already recovered the debt by selling the mortgaged property and there was no remaining
amount of debt due, the requirement of pre-deposit was satisfied and the borrower/appellants were

not required to tender any amount towards discharging the condition of pre-deposit for entertaining
the appeal under Section 18 of the SARFAESI Act .
5.3 Being aggrieved by the said order, the auction purchaser as well as the Bank filed the subject writ
petitions before the High Court. By the impugned common judgment and order, the High Court
dismissed the said writ petitions by observing that the borrower is not liable to deposit 50% of the
amount of the debt as initially claimed by the secured creditor in view of the recovery of the amount
by way of an auction sale. Thus, according to the High Court, the amount realised on deposit of the
sale consideration by the auction purchaser is required to be appropriated and/or adjusted towards
the amount of pre-deposit required to be deposited by the borrower under Section 18 of the
SARFAESI Act. 5.4 Feeling aggrieved and dissatisfied with the common impugned judgment and
order passed by the High Court, the auction purchasers have preferred the present civil appeals.
Rival submissions in CA Nos.8969 & 8970/2022
6. Learned counsel appearing on behalf of the principal borrower has vehemently submitted that the
High Court has materially erred in directing the principal borrower to deposit 50% of the remaining
sum of Rs. 4.1 crores as pre-deposit under Section 18 of the SARFAESI Act. 6.1 It is further
submitted that in the present case the secured property was sold in a public auction for a sum of Rs.
12.5 crores against the original amount of debt of Rs. 16.61 crores. That therefore the amount
recovered was more than 50% of the original amount of debt of Rs. 16.61 crores and therefore no
further order could have been passed directing the principal borrower to deposit any amount
towards pre- deposit as required under Section 18 of the SARFAESI Act. It is contended that the
amount realised by the financial institution by selling the secured property is required to be
adjusted/appropriated while considering the “debt due”.
6.2 It is further contended that while passing the impugned order, the High Court has
misinterpreted the definition of “debt” defined under Section 2(g) of the Recovery of Debts and
Bankruptcy Act, 1993 (hereinafter referred to as the ‘Act 1993’). That the “debt due” required to be
calculated to determine the pre-deposit amount shall have to be calculated deducting the money
received by the bank/financial institution during the pendency of the proceedings before the DRT.
6.3 It is next submitted that while passing the impugned judgment and order, the High Court has
erred in not applying the literal rule of interpretation for construing the second proviso to Section 18
of the SARFAESI Act for ascertaining true and correct meaning on the expression of “debt due”.
7. Learned counsel appearing on behalf of the financial institution and the auction purchaser have
vehemently submitted that the High Court has materially erred in directing the borrower to deposit
50% of the remaining Rs. 4.1 crores only as pre-deposit. It is contended that the said order is under
challenge by the financial institution in the present case and it is the case on behalf of the financial
institution that the High Court ought to have directed the borrower to deposit 50% of the original
amount of debt of Rs. 16.61 crores.
7.1 It is submitted that the High Court has very seriously erred in directing that the amount realised
from auction sale of the secured property shall have to be appropriated for the pre-deposit amount
Sidha Neelkanth Paper Industries ... vs Prudent Arc Limited on 5 January, 2023
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/197077609/
5
which is to be determined on the balance of the “debt due”, without considering the interest
component.
7.2 It is further submitted that as per proviso to Section 18 of the SARFAESI Act, the amount of
pre-deposit is to be calculated in respect of the amount of “debt due” and the “debt” in SARFAESI
Act is defined in Section 2(ha). It is submitted that as per section 2(ha) “debt” shall have the same
meaning as assigned to it in section 2(g) of the Act of 1993. It is submitted that on perusal of Section
2(g) of the Act of 1993, “debt due” would include liability + interest. It is submitted that in the
present case the High Court in the impugned judgment and order has observed and held that while
considering the pre-deposit under Section 18 of the SARFAESI Act, interest component is to be
ignored. It is submitted that the same is contrary to Section 2(ha) of the SARFAESI Act. 7.3 It is
further submitted that as the borrower has challenged the notice under Section 13(2) of the
SARFAESI Act and has also challenged the auction sale, adjustment of the amount recovered from
sale of the secured assets against the pre-deposit under Section 18 of the SARFAESI Act, could not
be permitted. Reliance is placed on the decision of the Bombay High Court in the case of Eskays
Construction Pvt. Ltd. v. Soma Papers & Industries Limited & Others, 2016 SCC OnLine Bom. 9827,
against which a special leave petition was filed and dismissed. It is submitted that even the proviso
to Section 18 of the SARFAESI Act does not provide for any such adjustment. It is averred that
therefore in the present case, the High Court has erred in allowing adjustment of the amount
recovered from sale of secured assets, the amount which has been deposited by the auction
purchaser and not borrower while considering pre-deposit under Section 18 of the SARFAESI Act.
Rival submissions in Civil Appeal Nos.8972 to 8974 of 2022
8. Shri Vinay Navare, learned Senior Advocate appearing on behalf of the auction purchaser, in
addition, has vehemently submitted that the requirement of deposit under Section 18 of the
SARFAESI Act is not for the purpose of securing payment of the creditor. That the objective is to
require the borrower to prove his bona fides and to discourage frivolous litigation from being
initiated by the borrower. It is submitted that therefore, this Court in the case of Axis Bank v. SBS
Organics Private Limited, (2016) 12 SCC 18 has held that the amount of pre-deposit is refundable to
the borrower after disposal of appeal. 8.1 It is next submitted that the language of Section 18 of the
SARFAESI Act is very clear and unambiguous. It says that the “borrower shall deposit”, which
means such amount is required to be brought in by the borrower and the amount standing with
creditor through auction sale cannot be for the benefit of the borrower. That the borrower can take
benefit of the amount received by the creditor in an auction sale only if he unequivocally accepts the
sale. It is submitted that if the borrower wants to question the sale, then he cannot claim the amount
of deposit for his benefit. The borrower cannot be allowed blow hot and cold.
8.2 Reliance is placed on the decision of this Court in the matter of M/s Shilpa Shares and Securities
v. National Cooperative Bank Ltd., (S.L.P (Civil) No. 14717/2022, decided on 21.11.2022) wherein it
has been held that the amount deposited pursuant to the order of this Court cannot be adjusted in
pre-deposit. That in the said case, the borrower applied for OTS and the matter reached this Court
and to show the bona fides of the borrower, while considering its prayer for OTS, this Court directed
to deposit certain amount. That thereafter the special leave petition came to be dismissed and in an
Sidha Neelkanth Paper Industries ... vs Prudent Arc Limited on 5 January, 2023

appeal challenging the proceedings under the SARFAESI Act, the borrower wanted to adjust and/or
appropriate the amount deposited pursuant to the order passed by this Court and that Court
negatived the same by observing that the amount deposited pursuant to the order of this Court
cannot be adjusted in pre-deposit.
8.3 Making above submissions, it is prayed that the impugned judgment and order passed by the
High Court be set aside and the borrower be directed to deposit 50% of the “debt due” without
adjusting and/or appropriating the amount realised by selling the secured assets.
9. Learned counsel appearing on behalf of the original borrowers have supported the impugned
judgment and order passed by the High Court of Madhya Pradesh and have submitted that the High
Court has not committed any error in dismissing the writ petitions and confirming the orders passed
by the DRAT by which the DRAT after adjusting/appropriating the amount realised by sale of the
secured property held that the borrowers are not required to deposit any further amount towards
pre-deposit as the amount realised is more than 50% of the ”debt due”.
Consideration:
10. We have heard learned counsel appearing on behalf of the secured creditor/assignee, the
respective auction purchasers and respective borrowers.
11. The short question which is posed for the consideration of this Court is, “whether, while
calculating the amount to be deposited as pre- deposit under Section 18 of the SARFAESI Act, 50%
of which amount the borrower is required to deposit as pre-deposit and whether while calculating
the amount of “debt due”, the amount deposited by the auction purchaser on purchase of the
secured assets is required to be adjusted and/or appropriated towards the amount of pre-deposit to
be deposited by the borrower under Section 18 of the SARFAESI Act?” Another question would be,
“whether the “debt due” under Section 18 of the SARFAESI Act would include the liability +
interest?”
12. While considering the aforesaid issues/questions, Section 18, & 2(ha) of the SARFAESI Act and
section 2(g) of the Recovery of Debts and Bankruptcy Act, 1993, which would have a direct bearing
are required to be referred to. The said provisions read as under:
18. Appeal to Appellate Tribunal.—(1) Any person aggrieved, by any order made by
the Debts Recovery Tribunal [under section 17, may prefer an appeal along with such
fee, as may be prescribed] to an Appellate Tribunal within thirty days from the date
of receipt of the order of Debts Recovery Tribunal.
[Provided that different fees may be prescribed for filing an appeal by the borrower
or by the person other than the borrower:] [Provided further that no appeal shall be
entertained unless the borrower has deposited with the Appellate Tribunal fifty per
cent. of the amount of debt due from him, as claimed by the secured creditors or
determined by the Debts Recovery Tribunal, whichever is less:

7
Provided also that the Appellate Tribunal may, for the reasons to be recorded in writing, reduce the
amount to not less than twenty-five per cent. of debt referred to in the second proviso.] (2) Save as
otherwise provided in this Act, the Appellate Tribunal shall, as far as may be, dispose of the appeal
in accordance with the provisions of the Recovery of Debts Due to Banks and Financial Institutions
Act, 1993 (51 of 1993) and rules made thereunder.
2(ha) “debt” shall have the meaning assigned to it in clause (g) of section 2 of the Recovery of Debts
Due to Banks and Financial Institutions Act, 1993 (51 of 1993) and includes—
(i) unpaid portion of the purchase price of any tangible asset given on hire or financial lease or
conditional sale or under any other contract;
(ii) any right, title or interest on any intangible asset or licence or assignment of such intangible
asset, which secures the obligation to pay any unpaid portion of the purchase price of such
intangible asset or an obligation incurred or credit otherwise extended to enable any borrower to
acquire the intangible asset or obtain licence of such asset;
Section 2(g) of the Recovery of Debts and Bankruptcy Act, 1993 - “debt” means any liability
(inclusive of interest) which is claimed as due from any person [or a pooled investment vehicle as
defined in clause (da) of section 2 of the Securities Contracts (Regulation) Act, 1956 (42 of 1956),] by
a bank or a financial institution or by a consortium of banks or financial institutions during the
course of any business activity undertaken by the bank or the financial institution or the consortium
under any law for the time being in force, in cash or otherwise, whether secured or unsecured, or
assigned, or whether payable under a decree or order of any civil court or any arbitration award or
otherwise or under a mortgage and subsisting on, and legally recoverable on, the date of the
application [and includes any liability towards debt securities which remains unpaid in full or part
after notice of ninety days served upon the borrower by the debenture trustee or any other authority
in whose favour security interest is created for the benefit of holders of debt securities or;]”
13. As per Section 2(ha) of the SARFAESI Act, “debt” shall have the same meaning assigned to it in
clause (g) of Section 2 of the Act 1993. As per section 2(g) of the Act 1993, “debt” means any liability
inclusive of interest which is claimed as due from any person….., by a bank or a financial institution
during the course of any business activity undertaken by the bank or the financial institution, in
cash or otherwise, whether secured or unsecured, or assigned, or whether payable under a decree or
order of any civil court or any arbitration award or otherwise or under a mortgage and subsisting on,
and legally recoverable on the date of the application. That the “debt” means any liability inclusive of
interest.
As per Section 18 of the SARFAESI Act, any person aggrieved, by any order made by the DRT under
section 17, may prefer an appeal within thirty days to an appellate Tribunal (DRAT) from the date of
receipt of the order of DRT. Second proviso to section 18 provides that no appeal shall be
entertained unless the “borrower” has deposited with the Appellate Tribunal fifty percent of the
amount of “debt due” from him, as claimed by the secured creditors or determined by the DRT,
whichever is less and only and only then, an appeal under Section 18 of the SARFAESI Act is

permissible against the order passed by the DRT under Section 17 of the SARFAESI Act. Under
Section 17, the scope of enquiry is limited to the steps taken under Section 13(4) against the secured
assets. Therefore, whatever amount is mentioned in the notice under Section 13(2) of the SARFAESI
Act, in case steps taken under Section 13(2)/13(4) against the secured assets are under challenge
before the DRT will be the ‘debt due’ within the meaning of proviso to Section 18 of the SARFAESI
Act. In case of challenge to the sale of the secured assets, the amount mentioned in the sale
certificate will have to be considered while determining the amount of pre-deposit under Section 18
of the SARFAESI Act. However, in a case where both are under challenge, namely, steps taken under
Section 13(4) against the secured assets and also the auction sale of the secured assets, in that case,
the “debt due” shall mean any liability (inclusive of interest) which is claimed as due from any
person, whichever is higher.
14. As observed hereinabove and as per the second proviso to Section 18 of the SARFAESI Act, it is
the “borrower” who has preferred an appeal before the Appellate Tribunal and the “borrower” who
shall have to deposit 50% of the amount of “debt due” from him. If the words used in the second
proviso to Section 18 of the SARFAESI Act are “borrower has to deposit”, it is not appreciable how
the amount deposited by the auction purchaser on purchase of secured assets can be adjusted
and/or appropriated towards the amount of pre-deposit, to be deposited by the borrower. It is the
“borrower” who has to deposit the 50% of the amount of “debt due” from him. At the same time, if
the borrower wants to appropriate and/or adjust the amount realised from sale of the secured assets
deposited by the auction purchaser, the borrower has to accept the auction sale. In other words, the
borrower can take the benefit of the amount received by the creditor in an auction sale only if he
unequivocally accepts the sale. In a case where the borrower also challenges the auction sale and
does not accept the same and also challenges the steps taken under Section 13(2)/13(4) of the
SARFAESI Act with respect to secured assets, the borrower has to deposit 50% of the amount
claimed by the secured creditor along with interest as per section 2(g) of the Act 1993 and as per
section 2(g), “debt” means any liability inclusive of interest which is claimed as due from any
person.
15. An identical question came to be considered by the Bombay High Court in the case of Eskays
Construction Pvt. Ltd. (supra). Before the Bombay High Court, it was the case on behalf of the
borrower that though as per Section 18 of the SARFAESI Act, no appeal filed by the borrower can be
entertained by the DRAT unless the borrower deposits with the DRAT 50% of the amount of “debt
due” from him, as claimed by the secured creditor or as determined by the DRT, whichever is less,
however, that does not mean that in a case where the properties of the borrower are sold and the
entire dues of the bank are recovered from that sale, the borrower still has to deposit 50% as
contemplated under Section 18 of the SARFAESI Act. While negativing the said submission, the
Bombay High Court considered the purpose and object of the SARFAESI Act in paragraph 14 as
under:
“14. We have heard the learned counsel for the parties at length and perused the
papers and proceedings in the Writ Petition along with the annexures thereto. Before
we deal with the rival contentions, it would be necessary to set out the purpose and
object for which the SARFAESI Act was brought into force. The statements of object

and reasons of the SARFAESI Act indicate that the financial sector, being one of the
key drivers in India's efforts to achieve success in rapidly developing its economy, did
not have a level playing field as compared to other participants in the financial
markets of the world. There was no legal provision for facilitating securitisation of
financial assets of banks and financial institutions, and unlike international banks,
the banks and financial institutions in India did not have the power to take
possession of securities and sell them. The Legislature felt that our existing legal
framework had not kept pace with the changing commercial practices and financial
sector reforms, which resulted in delays in recovery of defaulting loans. This in turn
had the effect of mounting levels of non-performing assets of banks and financial
institutions. In order to bring the Indian Banking Sector on par with International
Standards, the Government set up two Narasimhan Committees and the
Andhyarujina Committee for the purposes of examining banking sector reforms.
These Committees inter alia suggested enactment of a new legislation for
securitization and empowering banks and financial institutions to take possession of
the securities and to sell them without the intervention of the Court. Accepting these
recommendations, the SARFAESI Act was brought into force w.e.f. 21-06-2002.
There have been several amendments to the SARFAESI Act, the latest being an
amendment of 2016 that received the assent of the President on 12 August, 2016 and
was published in the Official Gazette dated 16 August, 2016. It is called the
Enforcement of Security Interest and Recovery of Debts Laws and Miscellaneous
Provisions (Amendment) Act, 2016. The preamble of this amending Act indicates
that the same was intended to further amend the SARFAESI Act, the RDDB Act, the
Indian Stamp Act, 1899 and the Depository Act, 1996 and for matters connected
therewith or incidental thereto.” Thereafter, the Bombay High Court considered in
detail Section 18.
After considering the decision of this Court in the case of Narayan Chandra Ghosh v. UCO Bank,
(2011) 4 SCC 548, it was observed and held that provisions of Section 18, more particularly the
second and the third proviso thereto are mandatory in nature and that the DRAT has no power to
grant full waiver of deposit. In paragraph 16, it is observed as under:
“16. Section 18(1) clearly stipulates, any person aggrieved by any order made by the
DRT under Section 17, may prefer an appeal to the DRAT within 30 days from the
date of receipt of the order of the DRT. The 2nd proviso to Section 18(1) stipulates
that no appeal shall be entertained by the DRAT unless the borrower has deposited
with it 50% of the amount of debt due from him, as claimed by the secured creditors
or as determined by the DRT, whichever is less. The 3 rd proviso to Section 18(1)
gives a discretion to the DRAT to reduce the aforesaid amount to not less than 25%,
provided the DRAT gives reasons for the same which are to be recorded in writing.
What becomes clear from the aforesaid provisions is that there is a jurisdictional bar
from entertaining an appeal filed by the borrower from an order passed under
Section 17, unless the borrower deposits 50% of the amount of debt due from him, as
claimed by the secured creditors or as determined by the DRT, whichever is less.

There is also a discretion granted to the DRAT to reduce this amount to 25% provided
it finds adequate reasons for doing so and gives reasons, that are recorded in writing.
If this deposit is not made, then the DRAT has no jurisdiction to entertain the appeal
of the borrower. The crucial words “debt due from him” have to be interpreted
consistent with the object and purpose sought to be achieved by the SARFAESI Act.
Unless the debt due is secured, the borrower cannot be allowed the luxury of
litigation. If that is permitted, the secured creditors would be engaged in a
continuous and futile litigation. On a plain reading of the section, it is clear that the
DRAT has no power or jurisdiction to reduce the deposit amount to less than 25%.
This is ex-facie clear from the plain and unambiguous language of Section 18 of the
SARFAESI Act.” That thereafter the Bombay High Court considered the submission
on behalf of the borrower that as the bank had already sold the secured assets for a
consideration that fully secured their claim and therefore there was no requirement
for the borrower to deposit any amount as contemplated under Section 18 of the
SARFAESI Act. The Bombay High Court did not accept the said submission by
observing that it would be ludicrous to suggest that the money realised by the bank
from sale of the secured assets could be used by the borrower to fulfil the condition of
pre-deposit under Section 18. The Bombay High Court has observed that it would be
a different matter if the sale is accepted and confirmed by the borrower. The Bombay
High Court further observed that the borrower cannot be permitted to use the sale
proceeds received from the sale of the subject properties to be adjusted/given credit
for in the application for waiver of deposit and at the very same time challenge the
sale of very same subject properties. The said decision of the Bombay High Court has
been confirmed by this Court as the special leave petition preferred impugning the
same, has been dismissed. Even otherwise, we are in full agreement with the view
taken by the Bombay High Court in the case of Eskays Construction Pvt. Ltd. (supra).
We are of the firm opinion and view that in a case where the borrower challenges the
auction sale, thereafter it will not be open for the borrower to pray to use the sale
proceeds received from the sale of the secured properties to be adjusted/given credit
in an application for waiver of pre-deposit.
16. In view of the above and for the reasons stated above, in the present case, the respective High
Courts have seriously erred in directing to adjust/appropriate the amount realised by auction sale of
the secured properties/deposited by the auction purchasers while considering the 50% of the
amount as pre-deposit to be deposited by the borrower, while preferring an appeal before the DRAT.
Even the High Court of Delhi has erred in excluding the amount payable towards interest while
considering the “debt due”. As per Section 2(g) of the Act 1993, “debt” means liability inclusive of
interest as claimed by the bank/financial institution.
17. In view of the above and for the reasons stated above, the respective appeals preferred by the
financial institution/assignee and auction purchasers being civil Appeal Nos. 8970, 8972, 8973 and
8974 of 2022 are hereby allowed. The appeal preferred by the borrower against the judgment and
order passed by the Delhi High Court being Civil Appeal No. 8969/2022 deserves to be dismissed
and is accordingly dismissed. It is observed and held that the borrower has to deposit 50% of the

amount of “debt due” as claimed by the bank/financial institution/assignee along with interest as
claimed in the notice under Section 13(2) of the SARFAESI Act and the borrower is not entitled to
claim adjustment/appropriation of the amount realised by selling the secured properties and
deposited by the auction purchaser when the auction sale is also under challenge.
18. Civil Appeal Nos. 8970, 8972, 8973 & 8974 of 2022 are accordingly allowed except Civil Appeal
No. 8969 of 2022. Consequently, Civil Appeal No. 8969 of 2022 stands dismissed, as observed
hereinabove. However, in the facts and circumstances of the case, there shall be no order as to costs.
