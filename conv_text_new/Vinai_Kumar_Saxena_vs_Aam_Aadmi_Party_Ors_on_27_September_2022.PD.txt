        HON'BLE MR. JUSTICE AMIT BANSAL
                                 JUDGMENT
AMIT BANSAL, J.
I.A. 15606/2022 (O-XXXIX R-1 & 2 of CPC)
1. The present suit has been filed on behalf of the plaintiff seeking relief of permanent injunction
and damages against the defendants on account of defamatory statements made on behalf of the
defendants no.1 to 6 on the social media platforms of the defendants no.7 and 8.
2. The plaintiff is the Lieutenant Governor (LG) of Delhi and is a Constitutional Authority. The
defendant no.1 is a political party, Aam Aadmi Party. The defendants no.2 to 6 are office bearers of
the defendant no.1 Party.
3. It is the case of the plaintiff that the defendants no.1 to 6 have launched a barrage of personal
attacks against the plaintiff, making unsubstantiated and baseless allegations that the plaintiff has
indulged in corruption and money laundering to the tune of Rs.1,400,00,00,000/- (rupees one
thousand four hundred crores) at the time of demonetization in November, 2016, while the plaintiff
was the Chairman of the Khadi and Village Industries Commission (KVIC).

4. The defendants no.1 to 6 have created and circulated hashtags, which include
"#LG_Saxena_Ko_Giraftar_Karo" and "#LG_Saxena_Chor_Hai". Further, the defendants no.1 to 6
have posted various tweets and videos in the form of interviews and press conferences on social
media platforms of the defendants no.7 and 8 in order to tarnish the reputation of the plaintiff.
5. The defendants no.1 to 6 have also conducted interviews in the news media towards defaming the
plaintiff. The whole foundation of the libelous posts/tweets and slanderous statements of the
defendants no.1 to 6 is based on extracts of the statements of two accused persons, being Mr.
Sanjeev Malik and Mr. Pradeep Kumar Yadav, former employees of KVIC, recorded pursuant to the
FIR dated 10th July, 2017 bearing no. RC-DAI-2017-A-0026 filed at page 606 of the documents of
the plaintiff.
6. To illustrate, some of the posts of the defendants no.1 to 6 are set out below:
7. In the FIR, the aforesaid accused are stated to have siphoned off approximately Rs.17,00,000/-,
which the defendants no.1 to 6 have alleged as having been done under the pressure of the plaintiff,

who was then the Chairman of KVIC.
8. Attention of the Court has been drawn to the screenshots of the Signature Not Verified Digitally
Signed By:AMIT BANSAL CS(OS) 593/2022 Page12:26:21 Signing Date:27.09.2022 3 of 13
tweets/re-tweets of the defendants filed at pages 58 and 60 of the documents filed by the plaintiff,
wherein the defendants no.1 to 6 have tweeted that the plaintiff has assigned a contract worth
Rs.80,00,00,000/- (rupees eighty crores) to his daughter, while he was the Chairman of KVIC.
Photograph of the plaintiff along with his daughter has also been posted with these tweets.
9. Yet another allegation has been made against the plaintiff that in violation of the rules of KVIC,
during the tenure of the plaintiff as Chairman, cash was distributed to the weavers in Baghalpur,
Bihar. Reference in this regard is made to the tweets by the defendant no.1, screenshots of which are
filed at page 31 of the documents of the plaintiff and the video of the press conference dated 7th
September, 2022 conducted by the defendant no.6, which has been made available for public
viewing on the social media platform of the defendant no.8.
10. A legal notice dated 5th September, 2022 was also issued on behalf of the plaintiff to the
defendants no.1 to 6 calling upon the defendants no.1 to 6 to refrain from making defamatory
statements against the plaintiff. However, no reply has been received by the plaintiff.
11. Senior counsels appearing on behalf of the plaintiff have made the following submissions:
(i) The alleged statements made by the accused persons pursuant to the aforesaid FIR are fabricated
and are not part of the statements made before the Investigation Agencies.
(ii) Even otherwise, the statements of the accused are in the nature of hearsay and therefore, on the
basis of the aforesaid statements, the defendants cannot tarnish the reputation of the plaintiff.
(iii) The daughter of the plaintiff had rendered her services as an interior Signature Not Verified

designer to KVIC on a pro bono basis. In this regard, attention of the Court is drawn to a letter dated
2nd September, 2022, issued by KVIC and filed at page 991 of the documents of the plaintiff.
(iv) The defendants no.1 to 6 have a huge following on social media and therefore, the defamatory
statements being made by them have a wide reach. Attention of the Court has been drawn to page
140 of the plaint, wherein the number of followers of the defendants no.1 to 6 are mentioned.
12. Reference is also made to the judgment of the Supreme Court in Institute of Chartered
Accountants v. L.K. Ratna, (1986) 4 SCC 537 followed by a Co-ordinate Bench of this Court in
Lakshmi Murdeshwar Puri v. Saket Gokhale, 2021 SCC OnLine Del 3675.
13. Per contra, senior counsels appearing on behalf of the defendants no.1 to 6 have justified the
impugned statements on the basis of truth and fair comment. It is stated that three allegations have
been made against the plaintiff, which are on the basis of materials already placed on record by the

plaintiff:
(i) The allegations of corruption on the part of the plaintiff during the demonetization in November,
2016 are based on the statements given by the accused persons, as extracted at pages 52 and 53 of
the plaint.
(ii) The daughter of the plaintiff was assigned a contract from KVIC for designing a lounge, while the
plaintiff was the Chairman of KVIC. This fact is admitted by the plaintiff in paragraph 105 of the
plaint.
(iii) Cash payments to various weavers in Baghalpur, Bihar were made when the plaintiff was the
Chairman of KVIC. Reliance in this regard is placed on the order dated 30th August, 2016 passed in
Civil Writ Jurisdiction Case No.2918 of 2016 by the Patna High Court.

14. It is further stated that there is sufficient material available with the defendants to justify the
aforesaid statements and therefore, no ad interim injunction order may be passed. It is submitted
that where even a semblance of material is found in support of an allegedly defamatory statement,
injunction cannot be granted and the veracity of the allegations must be tested during the course of
the trial. Reliance in this regard is placed on Prakash Jha Productions v. Bata India Limited & Ors.,
(2011) 8 SCC 372, Kailash Gehlot v. Vijender Gupta and Others, (2022) 290 DLT 92 and Tata Sons
Limited v. Greenpeace International & Anr., (2011) 178 DLT
705.
15. Issue notice. Notice is accepted by the counsels appearing on behalf of the defendants no.1 to 7.
16. Notice be issued to the defendant no.8 through all modes.
17. Reply(ies) be filed within four weeks.
18. Rejoinder(s) thereto, if any, be filed before the next date of hearing.
19. I have heard the counsels for the parties and perused the averments in the plaint as well as the
documents filed along with the plaint.
20. Before turning to the submissions of the parties, it is deemed apposite to spell out the contours
of free speech, as provided in Article 19 of the Constitution of India. Article 19(1)(a) of the
Vinai Kumar Saxena vs Aam Aadmi Party & Ors. on 27 September, 2022

Constitution afford the right of freedom of speech and expression to all persons. However, the same
is subject to restrictions under Article 19(2), which includes defamation. Therefore, the right to
freedom of speech and expression is not an unfettered right in the garb of which defamatory
statements can be made to tarnish the reputation of a person. The fundamental right to freedom of
speech has to be counterbalanced with the right of reputation of an individual, which has Signature
Not Verified Digitally Signed By:AMIT BANSAL CS(OS) 593/2022 Page12:26:21 Signing
Date:27.09.2022 6 of 13 been held to be a basic element of the right to life consecrated in Article 21
of the Constitution of India. Reference in this regard may be made to the judgment in Umesh Kumar
v. State of Andhra Pradesh and Another, (2013) 10 SCC 591.
21. At this prima facie stage, the Court has to adjudicate whether there is an element of truth in the
impugned content and/or whether it qualifies for the defence of fair comment. In this backdrop, I
will examine the three allegations made by the defendants no.1 to 6 against the plaintiff.
I. ACTS OF CORRUPTION DURING DEMONETIZATION
22. The statements made by the defendants no.1 to 6, that the plaintiff was involved in any acts of
corruption at the time of demonetization, are completely unsubstantiated. There is nothing to
suggest that the statements extracted at pages 52 and 53 of the plaint and relied upon in the tweet of
29th August, 2022 are made by the accused persons before the Investigating Agency. Even if the
aforesaid statements are taken to be correct, the said statements are completely based on hearsay,
being premised solely on the accused persons being told by other individuals that the said acts were
to be done at the behest of the Chairman. Further, the subject matter of the aforesaid statement is a
sum of Rs.17,00,000/-, which has been exaggerated by the defendants many times over, to a fanciful
sum of Rs. 1,400,00,00,000/- (rupees one thousand four hundred crores).
II. CONTRACT ASSIGNED TO THE PLAINTIFF 'S DAUGHTER
23. The defendants no.1 to 6 have also made allegations in respect of a contract of
Rs.80,00,00,000/- (rupees eighty crores) being assigned to the daughter of the plaintiff while the
plaintiff was the Chairman of KVIC. Once Signature Not Verified Digitally Signed By:AMIT BANSAL
CS(OS) 593/2022 Page12:26:21 Signing Date:27.09.2022 7 of 13 again, the defendants have made
unfounded allegations that an imaginary sum of Rs.80,00,00,000/- (rupees eighty crores) has been
paid to the daughter of the plaintiff. There is no material on record to substantiate the aforesaid
statement. Further, KVIC in its letter dated 2nd September, 2022 has clarified that no money was
paid to the daughter of the plaintiff for the professional services rendered by her.
III. CASH PAYMENTS MADE TO WEAVERS IN BIHAR
24. Counsels for the defendants have placed reliance on the order dated 30th August, 2016 passed in
Civil Writ Jurisdiction Case No.2918 of 2016 by the Patna High Court in support of the statements
made by the defendants that cash was distributed to the weavers in Bhagalpur, Bihar while the
plaintiff was the Chairman of KVIC. I have perused the order of the Patna High Court. There is
nothing in the said order that indicts the plaintiff in any manner. Even if some irregularities

occurred while the plaintiff was the Chairman of KVIC, the plaintiff cannot be made personally
liable for the same. This cannot be the basis of a personal attack against the plaintiff.
25. On behalf of the defendants, it has also been vehemently contended that in cases of defamation,
so long as some material has been placed on record, the veracity of the allegations can only be tested
in trial and the adequate remedy would be damages, not interim injunction. I do not agree with the
said submission. In appropriate cases where the Court is of the view that statements are
unsubstantiated and have been made in a reckless manner without regard to the truth, in order to
cause injury to the reputation of the plaintiff, the Court would be justified in granting an interim
injunction. If the aforesaid submission of the defendants is accepted, it would give the Signature Not
Verified Digitally Signed By:AMIT BANSAL CS(OS) 593/2022 Page12:26:21 Signing
Date:27.09.2022 8 of 13 defendant a free reign to continue making defamatory statements against
the plaintiff and continue to tarnish his reputation. Therefore, the Court cannot be powerless in such
a situation. After suffering the brunt of such defamatory content, it is difficult to contemplate a
complete restitution through damages. Such cases demand immediate injunctive relief and the
Court cannot wait for the defendants to place their response on record.
26. In the present case, the plaintiff, being a Constitutional Authority, cannot meet the personal
attacks being made by the defendants against him by taking resort to social media platforms. The
defendants have not even bothered to respond to the legal notice dated 5th September, 2022 sent on
behalf of the plaintiff. Therefore, the only remedy available for the plaintiff to protect his reputation
and prevent erosion of the same would be to approach the court of law and seek injunctive relief.
27. It has been submitted on behalf of the defendants that the plaintiff being a person in public life
cannot claim right to privacy in the same manner as that as an ordinary individual. In R. Rajagopal
alias R. R. Gopal and Another v. State of Tamil Nadu and Others, (1994) 6 SCC 632 cited on behalf
of the defendants, the Supreme Court has observed that in matters not relevant to discharge of his
duties, the public official enjoys the same protection as any other citizen. Relevant part of the
judgment is set out below:
"26. We may now summarise the broad principles flowing from the above discussion:
(1) The right to privacy is implicit in the right to life and liberty guaranteed to the citizens of this
country by Article 21. It is a "right to be let alone". A citizen has a right to safeguard the privacy of
his own, his family, marriage, procreation, Signature Not Verified Digitally Signed By:AMIT
BANSAL CS(OS) 593/2022 Page12:26:21 Signing Date:27.09.2022 9 of 13 motherhood,
child-bearing and education among other matters. None can publish anything concerning the above
matters without his consent -- whether truthful or otherwise and whether laudatory or critical. If he
does so, he would be violating the right to privacy of the person concerned and would be liable in an
action for damages. Position may, however, be different, if a person voluntarily thrusts himself into
controversy or voluntarily invites or raises a controversy.
(2) The rule aforesaid is subject to the exception, that any publication concerning the aforesaid
aspects becomes unobjectionable if such publication is based upon public records including court
Vinai Kumar Saxena vs Aam Aadmi Party & Ors. on 27 September, 2022
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/164403892/
6
records. This is for the reason that once a matter becomes a matter of public record, the right to
privacy no longer subsists and it becomes a legitimate subject for comment by press and media
among others. We are, however, of the opinion that in the interests of decency [Article 19(2)] an
exception must be carved out to this rule, viz., a female who is the victim of a sexual assault, kidnap,
abduction or a like offence should not further be subjected to the indignity of her name and the
incident being publicised in press/media.
(3) There is yet another exception to the rule in (1) above -- indeed, this is not an exception but an
independent rule. In the case of public officials, it is obvious, right to privacy, or for that matter, the
remedy of action for damages is simply not available with respect to their acts and conduct relevant
to the discharge of their official duties. This is so even where the publication is based upon facts and
statements which are not true, unless the official establishes that the publication was made (by the
defendant) with reckless disregard for truth. In such a case, it would be enough for the defendant
(member of the press or media) to prove that he acted after a reasonable verification of the facts; it
is not necessary for him to prove that what he has written is true. Of course, where the publication is
proved to be false and actuated by malice or personal animosity, the defendant would have no
defence and would be liable for damages. It is equally obvious that in matters not relevant to
Signature Not Verified Digitally Signed By:AMIT BANSAL CS(OS) 593/2022 Page12:26:21 Signing
Date:27.09.2022 10 of 13 the discharge of his duties, the public official enjoys the same protection as
any other citizen, as explained in (1) and (2) above. It needs no reiteration that judiciary, which is
protected by the power to punish for contempt of court and Parliament and legislatures protected as
their privileges are by Articles 105 and 104 respectively of the Constitution of India, represent
exceptions to this rule."
28. In Kailash Gehlot (supra) relied upon by the defendants, one of the factors that weighed with the
Court in not granting interim injunction was that the defamatory comments were in respect of
discharge of public functions by the plaintiff in his capacity as a minister. Admittedly, the allegations
made in the present case do not pertain to the plaintiff discharging his official duties as Lieutenant
Governor of Delhi.
29. Further, the reliance placed by the defendants on the judgments of Tata Sons (supra) and
Prakash Jha Productions (supra) is misplaced, as the said judgments are in the context of
defamation of a corporate entity, whereas the present case relates to defamation in respect of an
individual.

conferences/tweets/re-tweets/hashtags made by the defendants are per se defamatory. The same
have been made in a reckless manner, without any factual verification, in order to tarnish the
reputation of the plaintiff. It cannot be gainsaid that reputation of a person is earned after years and
the same cannot be tarnished by any other individual in a casual manner. The damage caused to the
reputation of an individual is immediate and far- reaching on the internet. So long as the impugned
content continues to be in circulation and visible on social media, it is likely to cause continuing
damage to the reputation and image of the plaintiff. Balance of convenience is in favour of the
plaintiff and against the defendants. Grave and irreparable Signature Not Verified Digitally Signed
