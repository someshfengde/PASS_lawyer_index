registered with Gevrai Police Station, Dist. Beed on 26.03.2019 for

with Section 34 of Indian Penal Code as well as the further
proceedings in R.C.C. No.99 of 2019 pending before the learned
Judicial Magistrate First Class, Gevrai.
2.     Applicant No.1 is the husband of respondent No.2. Applicant
Nos.2 is the father-in-law of respondent No.2. Applicant No.3 is the
mother-in-law of respondent No.2. Applicant Nos.4 is the sister-in-
law of respondent No.2 and applicant No.5 is the brother-in-law of
respondent No.2.

for the reliefs claimed by applicant Nos.2 to 5
5.     Perusal of the contents of the FIR lodged by respondent No.2
would show that she got married to applicant No.1 - husband on
15.05.2017.         It is then stated that at that time since there was
demonetization,          amount    of   Rs.2,00,000/-   was      given      to    the
applicants at the time of marriage, but it was as loan.                  After her
marriage, she was treated properly for about 3 to 4 months and,
thereafter it is stated that the mother-in-law and sister-in-law of
respondent No.2 started saying that she is unable to do household
activities properly.         After hearing that the husband of respondent
No.2 used to assault her.           She then states that the father-in-law
and brother-in-law used to abuse her on one or the other pretext.
She then states that the husband had assaulted her because of the
instigation by the other accused persons and then the accused
persons started asking her to bring amount of Rs.5,00,000/- for
purchasing house. All these allegations would show that the
allegations against applicant Nos.2 to 5 are vague and omnibus.
She has not given the details as to what abuses her father-in-law

and brother-in-law used to give her and on what count, because
she has stated that on some or the other pretext they used to
abuse her. Statement by mother-in-law and sister-in-law that she
is not doing the work in proper way cannot be taken as an

instigation.      Even if it is taken as instigation by the husband, for
that purpose the mother-in-law and sister-in-law will not be
responsible. In fact, such statement that a work is not done
properly can be attributed to any family member by another family
member, but it will not amount to instigation unless it is
accompanied by some action in demand.            Perusal of the charge-
sheet would show that there are statements of her parents and
other relatives and it would show the same facts, which could be
seen from the FIR i.e. given on 26.03.2019. It is also stated that
the statement of the father was also taken on 26.03.2019 and it
appears that he has given more details than the informant. Those
facts which are stated in detail by the father could have been told
by the informant only to him, but the informant is not making those
facts as the formation of the FIR.          Therefore, on the basis of
omnibus allegations, without assigning active role attracting the
ingredients of offence punishable under Section 498-A of IPC, it
would be unjust to ask applicant Nos.2 to 5 to face the trial.

of UP and Anr., [(2012) 10 SCC 741] and K. Subba Rao Vs.
The State of Telangana, [(2018) 14 SCC 452] have been
considered and it has been observed thus :-
            "18.        The       above-mentioned             decisions       clearly
            demonstrate           that    this   Court    has       at   numerous
            instances expressed concern over the misuse of
section 498A IPC and the increased tendency of
            implicating relatives of the husband in matrimonial
            disputes,           without     analysing         the     long       term
            ramifications of a trial on the complainant as well as
            the accused. It is further manifest from the said
            judgments that false implication by way of general
            omnibus        allegations       made        in    the       course      of
            matrimonial dispute, if left unchecked would result in
            misuse of the process of law. Therefore, this Court
            by way of its judgments has warned the courts from
            proceeding against the relatives and in-laws of the
            husband when no prima facie case is made out
            against them."
