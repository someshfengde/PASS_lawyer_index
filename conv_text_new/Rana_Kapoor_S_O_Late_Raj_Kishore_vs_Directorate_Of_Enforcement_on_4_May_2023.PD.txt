2. This is second application for bail. Previous application was rejected by this Court vide order
dated 25th January 2021. In view of direction issued by Hon'ble the Acting Chief Justice, this
application is listed before me.
3. On 7th March, 2020 CBI registered an FIR under Section 120- B r/w. 420 of Indian Penal Code,
1860 ("IPC" for short) and Sections 7, 12, 13(2) r/w. 13(1) (d) of Prevention of Corruption Act. ("P. C.
Act" for short). In the FIR it was alleged that during 2018-2019, Rana Kapoor (applicant) entered
into criminal conspiracy with Kapil Wadhwan, Promoter Director of M/s.DHFL and others for
extending financial assistance to M/s. Dewan Housing Finance Corporation Ltd ("DHFL" for short)
in lieu of substantial undue benefit to applicant and his family members through companies held by
them. During April-June, 2018 YES Bank invested Rs.3,700 Crores in short term debentures of
DHFL. Around the same time, Mr. Kapil Wadhwan paid kick back of Rs.600 Crores to applicant and
his family members by extending loan of Rs.600 Crores by DHFL to M/s. DOIT Urban Ventures
(India) Pvt. Ltd ("DUVPL" for short) a wholly owned subsidiary of M/s. RAB Enterprises (India)
Private Ltd in which Bindu Kapoor, wife of applicant is a Director and 100% shareholder. Daughters
of applicant Roshni Kapoor, Radha Kapoor Khanna and Rakhee Kapoor Tandon are 100%
shareholders of M/s. DOIT Urban Ventures (India) Pvt. Ltd through Morgan Credit Private Ltd. The
loan of 600 Crores was sanctioned by DHFL to DOIT on the basis of mortgage of sub-standard
property having meagre value and by considering its future conversion from agriculture land to the
residential land. M/s. DHFL has not redeemed amount of Rs.3700 3 of 16 3.BA.586.2023.doc
Crores invested by M/s.YES Bank in debentures. YES Bank also sanctioned loan of Rs.750 Crores to
M/s. RKW Developers which is DHFL group company for their Bandra Reclamation Project,
Mumbai and whole amount was siphoned off by Kapil Wadhwan since entire amount was
transferred by M/s. RKW Developers to M/s.DHFL without investment in Bandra Reclamation
Project for which loan was sanctioned thus applicant obtained undue pecuniary advantage from
M/s. DHFL in matter of investment in debentures of M/s.DHFL by YES Bank through companies
held by wife and daughters.
4. The complaint filed by the Directorate of Enforcement alleges that the applicant was MD/CEO of
YES Bank. He misused his position to gain financial benefits for himself and for his family members,
through companies controlled by them for sanctioning huge loans through YES Bank. He received
kick back over bogus loans extended by YES Bank to DHFL company, which was owned by Kapil
Wadhwan and Dheeraj Wadhwan and to its Group companies and those kick back amounts were
misused by the applicant for purchasing properties in the name of his family members. The
applicant deliberately used, projected and claimed those proceeds of crime as untainted by
laundering the same for personal gain. The daughters of the applicant are arrayed as accused No. 2
to 4 in complaint. They were holding 33.33 percent shares each in M/s. DOIT Urban Ventures
(India) Pvt. Ltd company which is arrayed as accused No. 6 in the complaint. M/s. Morgan Credits
Pvt Ltd Company ("MCPL" for short) is impleaded as accused No. 7. The said company was holding
99.99 percent shares of the company. Yes Bank had bought debentures of Rs.3,700 Crores of DHFL
company controlled by Kapil Wadhwan and Dheeraj Wadhwan during the 4 of 16
3.BA.586.2023.doc period from April 2018 to June 2018 and thereafter DHFL had paid kick back to

applicant under the garb of loan of Rs.600 Crores to accused No. 6. The said loan was given without
adequate collateral, though DHFL had not redeemed the amount of Rs.3700 Crores invested in its
debentures by YES Bank, and though accused No.6 did not have any business activity to repay the
loan. Loan of Rs.750 Crores was fraudulently given in the year 2018 from YES Bank by applicant to
M/s. Belief Realtors Pvt. Ltd, which was a group company of R.K.W of Wadhwan's for SRA
redevelopment of Bandra Reclamation Project. Deposits of people were used to purchase the
debentures, and as such loan was given to accused No. 6 to camouflage. The amounts were further
invested through subsidiary companies to divert the proceeds of crime and used for which accused
No. 2 to 4 were hand in glove with applicant/accused. Wife of applicant arrayed as accused No.5, is
the owner of M/s. RAB Enterprises India Pvt. Ltd., Co. which is impleaded as accused No.8 in the
complaint. The said company received a gift of Rs. 87 Crores from applicant. Wife of applicant is
house-wife having no source of funds, yet her company made huge investments in its subsidiary
companies, which fact was within her knowledge and thereby she had abetted commission of crime
of money laundering by the applicant. The applicant illegally obtained money for accused No.6 to 8
in connivance with Kapil Wadhwan, Dheeraj Wadhwan and others by entering into conspiracy in
respect to which CBI had registered a crime for the offences under Sections 120-B, 420 of IPC and
Sections 7, 12, 13(2) r/w. 13(1) (d) of Prevention of Corruption Act against the applicant, Kapil
Wadhwan, Dheeraj Wadhwan and Others. This kick back amount was used by applicant and his
family members for acquiring various properties and it is projected that the properties are 5 of 16
3.BA.586.2023.doc untainted. The complaint was filed on 6 th May 2020. The Court took
cognizance of the complaint vide order dated 23 rd May 2020 for offences under Sections 3 r/w. 4 of
the PMLA Act.
5. Pursuant to filing the complaint, further investigation was conducted. Supplementary complaint
was filed on 11 th July, 2020. In the supplementary complaint, it was alleged that during the
investigation, details of more than 100 companies owned by the applicant and his family members,
were found. In these companies, applicant's family members had majority share holding, and all
financial transactions were handled by the applicant. It was noticed that many of those companies
are not operative and are used for siphoning off illegally obtained money i.e. proceeds of crime by
applicant. It is also found that dummy Directors were appointed by the applicant on the board of
many of these companies. Cognizance of supplementary complaint was taken by order dated 23 rd
July 2020. Second supplementary complaint was filed on 14 th March 2022. Cognizance of said
complaint was taken on 6 th April 2022. The third supplementary complaint was filed in
August-2022. The Special Judge took cognizance of complaint vide order dated 25 th August 2022.
6. Learned advocate for Applicant submitted as under :-
(i) The applicant has been incarcerated for a period exceeding the minimum sentence period
prescribed by way of punishment for the offence under Section 3 of the PMLA Act, which is
punishable under Section 4 where the minimum sentence is three years, and the maximum is seven
years. This was not the position when the first bail application was rejected earlier on 25 th January

(ii) Till date no charge is framed though the applicant has put in three years one month and thirteen
days in pre-trial custody;
(iii) The record of the lower Court which is handling the case reveals that there is no likelihood of
the trial commencing in the near future including even the framing of charges. The reply of
Respondent no.1 before this Court corroborates this contention that ultimately the prerogative to
frame charge is with the lower Court and not with them and they cannot say anything about the trial
commencing or concluding. This can be discerned from page 1282 and page 1283 of the reply;
(iv) The fetters of Section 45 of PMLA Act are subservient to Article 21 of Constitution of India and
considering the current situation and the trend of cases and case laws by the Hon'ble Supreme Court
and this Hon'ble Court post the rejection of the application of the Applicant, he deserves to be
released on bail, because there is no likelihood of the trial being started in the near future much less
completed;
(v) The right to get bail in such cases is completely independent of the right under Section 436A of
the Cr.P.C, a right which is recognized by Hon'ble Supreme Court in the case of Vijay Madanlal
Chowdhury (2022-SCC OnLine-SC-929) even to cases that fall u/s.3 of PMLA Act;
(vi) While granting bail to the applicant in PMLA Special Case No.404 of 2021, the Special Court
under PMLA in its order dated 1st April 2023, has discussed the nature and volume of trial of PMLA
case. It is observed that as per Section 44(1)(c) of PMLA Act, the case relating to the scheduled
offence has to be committed to the said Court, which has taken cognizance of PMLA case. After 7 of
16 3.BA.586.2023.doc commitment both the cases have to be tried simultaneously but separately
and not jointly. Even if the PMLA Special Court is one, there may be number of cases relating to
scheduled offence, which have to be committed and tried simultaneously with PMLA special case.
There are so many cases which have been pending in the said court to show that for a single PMLA
case, there are multiple cases relating to the scheduled offence.
(vii) The Supreme Court recently in the decision of Ritu Chhabria Vs. Union of India (Criminal Writ
Petition No.60 of 2023, dated 26th April 2023), has considered the law relating to default bail
u/s.167(2) of Cr.P.C on the ground of filing incomplete charge sheet. In the reply filed by
Respondents it is stated that investigation is still in progress. However, present application is
preferred primarily on the ground of long incarceration in custody without trial, and learned counsel
would restrict his argument to the extent of bail on the ground of being in custody for more than
three years.
(viii) Applicant has been granted bail by concerned Courts in five cases. The applicant is in custody
without bail in three cases including the present case;
(ix) The Apex Court and this Court in several cases granted bail to the accused including PMLA
cases where they are in custody for substantial period of one year or more than that. There are
several accused in this case, about fifty witnesses and voluminous documents. Trial would not be
concluded soon.

8. Learned advocate for Respondent no.1 submitted that previous application for bail has been
rejected by this Court on merits. There is no change in circumstance to entertain second application
for bail. There is no constructive change in entertaining this application. While considering
application for bail u/s.379 of Cr.P.C, long incarceration, if any, has to be considered with the merits
of case. He relied upon decision of Hon'ble Supreme Court in the case of Kalyanchandra Sarkar Vs.
Rajesh Ranjan @ Pappu Yadav and another (2005-Cri.L.J.-944). He also relied upon order dated 3
rd April 2023 passed by this Court in the case of Hemant Dahyalal Bhatt Vs. Central Bureau of
Investigation and another (Cri.Bail Application No.2895 of 2022) wherein it is observed that the
gravity of the accusations and the seriousness of the charges when juxtaposed against the long
incarceration, the former would gain a primacy. The offence committed by the accused persons is
mammoth in all aspects and is considered to be a gigantic fraud, which has largely impacted
economy of the country. It is submitted that this is the application under Section 438 of Cr.PC.
Investigating agency cannot be held responsible for delay. The applicant is involved in serious
economic fraud. Prosecution is ready to proceed with trial.
9. Undisputedly previous application for bail was rejected by this Court vide order dated 25th
January 2021. In paragraphs 11 to 14 of the said order, it was observed as follows :-
"11. I have perused the documents on record. The case of complainant/respondents is
that the ECIR was registered on 07th March 2020 in pursuant to 10 of 16
3.BA.586.2023.doc registration of FIR by CBI. During the course of investigation, it
was noticed that M/s. YES Bank Limited had subscribed to debenture issued by
DHFL worth Rs.3700 Crores during the period April to June 2018. It was further
noticed that simultaneously DHFL had sanctioned loan of Rs.600 Crores to
M/s.DOIT Urban Venture Limited of family Enterprise of applicant. As the said, the
transactions appeared suspicious in nature, searches were conducted at the
residential premises of the applicant on 06th March 2020 in connection with said
transactions and crucial document were recovered. CBI registered FIR No.
RC-219-2020-E0004 dated 07 th March 2020 against DHFL, M/s. DOIT Urban
Venture India Limited, applicant, promoter director CEO of M/s. YES Bank Limited,
Kapil Wadhawan, promoter director of M/s. Diwan Housing Finance Limited, Mr.
Dheeraj Wadhawan Director of RKW Developers Private Limited and others, under
Section 120-B read with Section 420 IPC and Section 7, 12, 13(2) of P. C. Act. As per
Rana Kapoor S/O Late Raj Kishore ... vs Directorate Of Enforcement ... on 4 May, 2023

the FIR, the applicant had entered into criminal conspiracy with Mr.Kapil Wadhawan
and others for extending financial assistance to M/s. DHFL by YES Bank Limited in
lieu of substantial undue benefit to himself and his family members through the
companies held by them. Investigation was initiated by respondent No.1 into offences
of money laundering. The main accused applicant is the promoter of his family group
companies being operated under flagship of MCPL, YCPL and RAB. These companies
were used by him for layering and parking proceeds of crime. He was controlling
authority and the decision maker. He is prime accused who with the help of
Associates devised the mode of fraud, conspiring with other accused to cheat the
bank in the manner explained in complaint. The proceeds of crime has been siphoned
off and laundered for concealment layering through acquisition of properties. During
the course of investigation, it was revealed that while working as MD/CEO of YES
Bank applicant had connived with Kapil Wadhwan, Promoter of DHFL and others to
extend undue financial benefit to M/s. DHFL by YES Bank and to get return undue
benefit from Wadhwans for himself and family through companies held by them.
During April to June 2018 M/s. YES Bank invested Rs.3700 Crores in the short term
debentures of 11 of 16 3.BA.586.2023.doc M/s. DHFL and simultaneously Kapil
Wadhwan paid kick back of Rs.600 Crores under garb of loan to DOIT Urban
Ventures (India) Pvt. Ltd. The daughters of the applicant are 100% shareholder of
DOIT Private Limited through M/s. Morgan Credits Private Limited. Loan of Rs. 600
Crores was sanctioned by M/s. DHFL to M/s. DOIT Urban Venture India Private
Limited, on the basis of mortgage of substandard properties having meagre value and
considering its future conversion from agriculture land to residential land.
M/s.DHFL has not redeemed the amount of Rs.3700 Crores invested by M/ s. YES
Bank in its debentures till date. M/s. YES Bank had also sanctioned loan of 750
Crores to M/s. Belief Realtors one of RKW Developers group of companies
beneficially owned by Wadhawans for its Bandra Reclamation Project but the whole
amount was siphoned off by Kapil Wadhawan and Dheeraj Wadhwan to M/s.DHFL
without making investment in Bandra Reclamation Project. Investigation revealed
that Wadhwans had criminally conspired with applicant for illegal sanction of loans
to their respective entities.
12. According to complainant details of several companies beneficially owned by the
applicant and his family members were collected. The accused are involved in
diverting proceeds of crime and layering, siphoning funds. The complaint refers to
the chart of flow of funds. The accused had fraudulently obtained and siphoned off
crores of rupees by cheating and defrauding the YES Bank. The investigation
conducted so far reveals that total estimated proceed of crime is to the tune of Rs.
5050 Crore (3700+600+750). The figure has been disputed by the applicant. It is
contended by the applicant that Rs.600 Crores has been added once again. The
complainant further mention that the group of companies beneficially owned by the
applicant and his family members are controlled by Applicant. The modus operandi
devised by the applicant, with criminal intent was to enjoy loan facility without
providing proper collateral. The said money being proceeds of crime was laundered

by the applicant. It is clearly established that the fund acquired by the accused were
obtained without proper collaterals and as per prescribed requirement. The
complainant also provides role played by each of the accused in 12 of 16
3.BA.586.2023.doc transaction. The complainant mentioned that during the tenure
of the applicant, YES Bank had extended loan to entity, despite them incurring losses
and having negative net worth. There entities extended loans to the companies
beneficially owned by applicant. Applicant's family members having no substantial
business and on the basis of artificially inflated value of mortgage. During the tenure
of the applicant with YES Bank, amount of 750 Crores was sanctioned to M/s. Belief
Realtors Pvt. Ltd. which is one of the group company of RKW adventure. The
proceeds of crime were Rs.5050 Crores. The applicant was the founder of DOIT
Urban Ventures. Findings of the investigating agency were that huge economic scam
was brewing since many years in YES Bank during the tenure of the applicant. It
came to notice that there was poor credit culture, poor compliance culture,
centralization of power and lack of institutionalization prevailing in YES Bank.
13. The statement of witnesses shows the complicity of the applicant in the crime.
Further investigation was conducted and supplementary complaint has been filed
before the competent Court. The supplementary complaint also discloses great details
as to how the accused have indulged in the alleged acts. The findings of the further
investigation as reflected in the supplementary complaint and the documents therein
indicate that huge economic scam was brewing in YES Bank and DHFL. The
perpetrators of scam in YES Bank was the applicant and in DHFL, they were Kapil
Wadhawan and Dheeraj Wadhawan. Effective and honest governance of
banks/financial institutions is critical to proper functioning of the banking sector and
the economy as a whole. The applicant while working as MD/CEO of the YES Bank
had connived with the co- accused with intention to extend undue financial benefit to
M/s.DHFL by YES Bank and to get in return benefits from DHFL for himself and his
family through companies held by them. Yes Bank had brought debentures worth Rs.
3700 Crore between April 2018 to June 2018 from DHFL and DHFL gave loan of
Rs.600 Crore to DOIT which is beneficially owned by applicant and his family. The
applicant's family member had majority shareholding and all financial transactions
were handled by applicant. it was noticed that there 13 of 16 3.BA.586.2023.doc
companies were not operating and used for siphoning off illegally obtained money i.e.
proceeds of crime by the applicant.
14. The case of the complainant is that M/s.DUVPL is a company beneficially owned
by the applicant through his daughters. The applicant entered into conspiracy with
Kapil Wadhawan and Dheeraj Wadhawan. YES Bank extended loan to entity despite
incurring losses. These entities extended loan to company owned by the applicant,
applicant's family members having no business which indicate the case of the Quid
pro quo. According to the complainant there was no active or operating business in
M/s. DUVPL at the time of proposal of loan. The loan proposal had been approved by
DHFL on the basis of substandard properties furnish as security by DUVPL a

company owned by daughters of applicant. The said company has no business
activity and not generating any revenue. The applicant and Promoter/Director of
DHFL conspired to get sanctioned loan to the respective entities from YES Bank and
DHFL respectively. The Applicant was the person on ground interacting with
Wadhawans. During the course of investigation, it was revealed that loan of Rs.7500
Crores disbursed by YES Bank to M/s. Belief Realtors Private Limited. It was not
utilized for the purpose to which is sanctioned. The proceeds of crime according to
complainant involved in this case is Rs.5050 Crores. It is also revealed that the
applicant had siphoned off huge amount out of India through his family/group
owned controlled companies. It is found that out of the proceeds of crime of Rs.600
Crores, Rs.378 Crores were invested overseas. The investigation in relation to exact
foreign proceeds of crime is still under investigation. The applicant and his family
members have incorporated or beneficially interest in various companies. The
applicant is desperately trying to dispose of his property. He has given online
advertisement for sale of his London based property. The said property is attached by
ED vide provisional attachment order dated 25th September 2020 being proceeds of
crime in terms of Section 2 (1) (u) of PMLA Act. According to complainant if the
applicant is released on bail, he will try to sell that property. Further investigation is
