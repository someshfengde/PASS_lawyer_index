B.R. GAVAI, J.
I.   INTRODUCTION
1.   This reference to the larger bench of Five-Judges arises
out of the writ petitions filed challenging the Notification No.
3407(E) dated 8th November 2016 (hereinafter referred to as
Vivek Narayan Sharma vs Union Of India on 2 January, 2023
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/164842744/
2
“the impugned Notification”), issued by the Central Government
in exercise of the powers conferred by sub-section (2) of Section
26 of the Reserve Bank of India Act, 1934 (hereinafter referred
to as “the RBI Act”), vide which the Central Government
declared that the bank notes of denominations of the existing
series of the value of five hundred rupees and one thousand
rupees shall cease to be legal tender with effect from 9 th
November 2016, to the extent specified in the impugned
Notification.   This is popularly known as an act/policy of
‘demonetization’.
                                3
b.    Immediately after the impugned Notification was issued,
several writ petitions challenging the policy of demonetization
came to be filed before this Court as also before various High
Courts.      Transfer Petitions were filed by the Union, seeking
transfer of all such matters pending before the High Courts to
this Court.
3.    A bench of learned three Judges of this Court passed an
order dated 16th December 2016 in Writ Petition (Civil) No.906
of 2016 and other connected petitions, observing therein that,
in   their       opinion,   following   important   questions   fall   for
consideration:
          “(i)       Whether the notification dated 8th
                     November 2016 is ultra vires Section
                     26(2) and Sections 7, 17, 23, 24, 29
                     and 42 of the Reserve Bank of India
                     Act, 1934;

3
          (ii)       Does the notification contravene the
                     provisions of Article 300A of the
                     Constitution;
          (iii)      Assuming that the notification has been
                     validly issued under the Reserve Bank
                     of India Act, 1934 whether it is ultra
                                        4
�         vires Articles       14   and   19   of   the
         Constitution;
(iv)     Whether the limit on withdrawal of cash
         from the funds deposited in bank
         accounts has no basis in law and
         violates Articles 14, 19 and 21;
(v)      Whether the implementation of the
         impugned notification(s) suffers from
         procedural     and/or      substantive
         unreasonableness and thereby violates
         Articles 14 and 19 and, if so, to what
         effect?
(vi)     In the event that Section 26(2) is held to
         permit demonetization, does it suffer
         from excessive delegation of legislative
         power thereby rendering it ultra vires
         the Constitution;
(vii)    What is the scope of judicial review in
         matters relating to fiscal and economic
         policy of the Government;
(viii)   Whether a petition by a political party
         on the issues raised is maintainable
         under Article 32; and
(ix)     Whether District Co-operative Banks
         have been discriminated against by
         excluding them from accepting deposits
         and exchanging demonetized notes.”
                          5
d.    Vide the said order dated 16th December 2016, this Court
also directed that, if any other writ petitions/proceedings were

4
pending in any High Court, further hearing of those matters
should also remain stayed. This Court further directed that no
other Court should entertain, hear or decide any writ
petition/proceeding on the issue of or in relation to or arising
from the decision of the Government of India to demonetize the
notes of Rs.500/- and Rs.1,000/-, since the entire issue in
relation thereto was pending consideration before this Court.
II.   BACKGROUND
5.    Before we consider the matter, it will be necessary to refer
to certain facts.
6.    On 8th November 2016, vide the impugned notification, the
Central Government, in exercise of the powers conferred by
sub-section (2) of Section 26 of the RBI Act, notified that the
specified bank notes (hereinafter referred to as “SBNs”) shall
cease to be legal tender with effect from 9th November 2016.
                                6
�The SBNs were bank notes of denominations of the existing
series of the value of Rs.500/- and Rs.1000/-. Under clause 1
of the said notification, every banking company and every
Government Treasury was required to complete and forward a
return along with the details of SBNs held by it at the close of
business as on the 8th November 2016, not later than 13:00
hours on the 10th November 2016 to the designated Regional
Office of the Reserve Bank of India (hereinafter referred to as
“RBI”).    Insofar as the individual persons were concerned,
Vivek Narayan Sharma vs Union Of India on 2 January, 2023

5
under clause 2 of the impugned notification, they were entitled
to exchange SBNs in various banks specified therein upto 30th
December 2016 subject to certain conditions.         Initially it
provided a limit of Rs.4,000/- for such exchange.        It also
provided that the limit of Rs.4,000/- for exchanging SBNs shall
be reviewed after 15 days from the date of commencement of
the impugned notification. It further provided that, insofar as
Know      Your   Customer   (KYC)   compliant   bank    account
maintained by a person with a bank was concerned, there was
                               7
�no limit on the quantity or value of the SBNs that could be
credited to such an account.        However, insofar as non-KYC
compliant bank accounts were concerned, an outer limit was
fixed at Rs.50,000/-. There were certain other provisions made
under the impugned notification.
7.   Vide another notification of the even date, various other
relaxations were granted whereunder SBNs could be used for
making payment in Government hospitals, pharmacies, Railway
booking centers, for purchases at consumer cooperative stores,
milk booths, purchase of petrol, etc.   The said relaxations were
to be valid till 11th November 2016.         Thereafter, various
notifications came to be issued from time to time granting
further relaxations.
8.   On 30th December 2016, the Specified Bank Notes
(Cessation of Liabilities) Ordinance, 2016 (hereinafter referred
to as “the 2016 Ordinance”) was promulgated by the Hon’ble
Vivek Narayan Sharma vs Union Of India on 2 January, 2023
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/164842744/

President of India. Subsequently, the Parliament enacted the
                                8
�Specified Bank Notes (Cessation of Liabilities) Act, 2017
(hereinafter referred to as “the 2017 Act”), which received the
assent of the then Hon’ble President of India on 27th February
2017.
9.   Section 3 of the 2017 Act provides that, on and from the
appointed day, notwithstanding anything contained in the RBI
Act or any other law for the time being in force, the SBNs which
had ceased to be legal tender in view of the impugned
Notification of the Government of India, shall cease to be
liabilities of the RBI under Section 34 of the RBI Act and shall
cease to have the guarantee of the Central Government under
sub-section (1) of Section 26 of the RBI Act.
10. Section 4 of the 2017 Act provides for a grace period in
case of certain classes of persons holding such SBNs on or
before the 8th day of November, 2016 for tendering, with such
declarations or statements, at such offices of the RBI or in such
other manner as may be specified by it. One of the classes of
                                9
�persons who was provided a grace period by clause (i) of sub-
section (1) of Section 4 of the 2017 Act was a citizen of India
who makes a declaration that he was outside India between 9th
November 2016 and 30th December 2016.          Clause (ii) of sub-
Vivek Narayan Sharma vs Union Of India on 2 January, 2023
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/164842744/
7
section (1) of Section 4 of the 2017 Act also provided a grace
period for such class of persons and for such reasons as may
be specified by Notification, by the Central Government.
11. Sub-section (2) of Section 4 of the 2017 Act provides that
the RBI may, if satisfied, after making such verification as it
may consider necessary that the reasons for failure to deposit
the notes within the period specified in the notification referred
to in Section 3, are genuine, credit the value of the notes in his
‘KYC compliant bank account’ in such manner as may be
specified by it.   Sub-section (3) of Section 4 of the 2017 Act
makes a provision for enabling any person, aggrieved by the
refusal of the RBI to credit the value of the notes under sub-
section (2), to make a representation to the Central Board of the
                                10
�RBI (hereinafter referred to as “the Central Board”) within
fourteen days of the communication of such refusal to him.
12. On the very same day of the promulgation of the 2016
Ordinance i.e. 30th December 2016, the Central Government
issued Notification No. 4251(E), in exercise of the powers
conferred by clause (b) of sub-section (1) of Section 2, read with
clause (i) of sub-section (1) of Section 4 of the 2016 Ordinance.
It provided a grace period till 31st day of March 2017 to citizens
who were residents in India. Insofar as the citizens who were
not resident in India are concerned, the period was upto 30th
day of June 2017. The proviso thereto limited the amount of
SBNs tendered to not exceed the amount specified under

regulation   3   or   regulation    8   of   the   Foreign   Exchange
Management (Export and Import of Currency) Regulations,
2015 [Notification No. FEMA 6 (R)/RB-2015, dated the 29th
December, 2015] made under the provisions of the Foreign
Exchange Management Act, 1999 (42 of 1999) and the
conditions specified therein are complied with.
                                   11
a3. Some of the writ petitions were listed before this Court on
21st March 2017, when this Court passed the following order:
          “1.   Issue notice.
          2.   On     our     asking,     Mr.    R.
          Balasubramanyam,       learned   counsel,
          accepts notice on behalf of the Union of
          India and Mr. H.S.       Parihar, learned
          counsel, accepts notice on behalf of the
          Reserve Bank of India.
          3.     Having heard submissions, which
          remained       inconclusive,  and    before
          proceeding further with the matter, it was
          felt, that this Court should ascertain from
          the Union of India (a) whether the Central
          Government intends to exercise the
          power conferred by clause (4)(1)(ii) of
          Ordinance 10 of 2016; and (b) if the
          answer to (a) is in the negative, the
          reason why the Central Government
          chose not to exercise its jurisdiction. An
          affidavit may accordingly be filed by the
          Central Government, explaining its
          position to this Court.
          4.   Needful be done within two weeks
          from today.
          5.  Post    for   hearing   on   11th   April,
          2017.”

           “26. In view of the above and those to be
           urged at the time of hearing, it is most
           humbly submitted that the Central
           Government took a conscious decision
           that no necessity or any justifiable reason
           exists either in law or on facts to invoke
           its power under Section 4(1)(ii) of the
           Ordinance to entitle any person to tender
           within the grace period the specified bank
           notes.”
15. The matter came up for hearing before this Bench initially
on 12th October, 2022 and, thereafter, on various dates.        We
have heard Shri P. Chidambaram and Shri Shyam Divan,
learned Senior Counsel, Shri Prashant Bhushan, learned
counsel, Shri Viplav Sharma, petitioner-in-person in support of
the petitions and Shri R. Venkataramani, learned Attorney
General appearing for the Union of India and Shri Jaideep
Gupta, learned Senior Counsel appearing for the RBI. We have
                                13
�also heard the learned counsels appearing in the connected
petitions.
III.   SUBMISSIONS OF PETITIONERS
16. Shri P. Chidambaram, learned Senior Counsel led the
arguments on behalf of the petitioners.
17. Shri P. Chidambaram submitted that, upon its correct
interpretation, sub-section (2) of Section 26 of the RBI Act will
Vivek Narayan Sharma vs Union Of India on 2 January, 2023
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/164842744/
10
have to be read down in a manner that sub-section (2) of
Section 26 of the RBI Act does not permit the power to be
exercised in respect of “all series” of notes of a specified
denomination. He submits that the word “any” will denote that
the power can be exercised only when a particular series of any
denomination is sought to be demonetized.
18. Shri Chidambaram submits that, on earlier occasions i.e.
by the High Denomination Bank Notes (Demonetization)
Ordinance,    1946   (hereinafter    referred   to   as   “the   1946
Ordinance”)   and    the   High      Denomination     Bank       Notes
                                14
�(Demonetization) Act, 1978 (hereinafter referred to as “the 1978
Act”), “all series” of high denomination bank notes were
demonetized.   He submits that, by the 1946 Ordinance, high
denomination bank notes were meant to be “all series” of bank
notes of the denominational value of Rs.500/- Rs.1,000/- and
Rs.10,000/-.      Similarly,   by    the   1978   Act,   the   high
denomination bank notes were meant to be “all series” of the
bank   notes of the denominational value of Rs.1,000/-,
Rs.5,000/- and Rs,10,000/-. It is thus submitted that,
whenever it was found necessary to demonetize “all series” of a
particular denomination, it was considered necessary to do so
by way of a separate enactment of Parliament.
19. Shri Chidambaram submits that, since the bank notes are
issued in different series, the words “any series” before the
words “of bank notes of any denomination” appearing in sub-
Vivek Narayan Sharma vs Union Of India on 2 January, 2023
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/164842744/
11
section (2) of Section 26 of the RBI Act, will have to be
construed as limiting the power of the Government to declare
only a specified series of notes to be no longer legal tender. He
                                15
�submits that it will have to be held that the words “any series”
mean “any specified series” and not “all series” of bank notes.
20. Shri Chidambaram submits that, if it is held that the
Central Government is conferred with the power under sub-
section (2) of Section 26 of the RBI Act to demonetize currency
notes of “all series”, then a situation may arise wherein the
bank notes issued on the previous day can be demonetized on
the very next day.      He submits that, as a result of the
demonetization done on 8th November 2016, even the currency
notes issued on the previous day of the denominational value of
Rs.500/- and Rs.1,000/- had become illegal tender.
21. Shri Chidambaram submits that if sub-section (2) of
Section 26 of the RBI Act is not read down in the aforesaid
manner, then the said Section would be vulnerable to be
challenged on the ground that it confers an unguided,
uncanalised    and   arbitrary    power   upon   the   Executive
Government. He submits that, in such a situation, the said
                                 16
�provision is liable to be struck down on the ground that it
violates Articles 14, 19, 21 and 300A of the Constitution of
India. He submits that the fact that the demonetization of “all
Vivek Narayan Sharma vs Union Of India on 2 January, 2023
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/164842744/
12
series” of high denominational currency notes in the years 1946
and 1978 was done through separate enactments of Parliament
would support the said proposition.
22. Shri Chidambaram submits that, upon a plain reading of
sub-section (2) of Section 26 of the RBI Act, it is obvious that
there is neither any policy nor any guidelines in the said
provision.     What factors are required to be taken into
consideration and what factors are to be eschewed from
consideration, are not specified in sub-section (2) of Section 26
of the RBI Act.    It is submitted that if a drastic power of
demonetizing    currency   notes    of   “all   series”   in   certain
denominations is to be entrusted to the Executive Government,
then Parliament ought to have laid down the guidelines for
exercising such power. He submits that, in the absence of
anything of that nature, it will have to be held that the
                               17
�delegation to the Executive Government is excessive, arbitrary
and as such, violative of Articles 14, 19, 21 and 300A of the
Constitution of India.           Learned Senior Counsel relied on the
Constitution Bench Judgments of this Court in the cases of
Hamdard Dawakhana (Wakf) Lal Kuan, Delhi and another
v. Union of India and others1 and Harakchand Ratanchand
Banthia and others v. Union of India and others2 in
support of his submissions.
23. Shri Chidambaram submits that, in any case, the
decision-making process in the present case was deeply flawed
Vivek Narayan Sharma vs Union Of India on 2 January, 2023
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/164842744/
13
and, therefore, is liable to the scrutiny of judicial review by this
Court.
24. The learned Senior Counsel submits that a plain reading
of sub-section (2) of Section 26 of the RBI Act would reveal that
the Central Government can exercise the power only on the
recommendation of the Central Board.                 It is, therefore,
1
2    (1960) 2 SCR 671
    (1969) 2 SCC 166 = (1970) 1 SCR 479
                                          18
�submitted that it is implicit in the said sub-section that the
proposal for demonetization must emanate from the RBI. It is
submitted that, from the scheme of the RBI Act, it is clear that
the Central Board, consisting of Members specified in Section 8
of the RBI Act, would consider all relevant material, weigh the
pros and cons, consider the impact of the proposed measure on
the people of the country and the consequences on the
economy before making a recommendation.             It is submitted
that, on a plain reading of sub-section (2) of Section 26 of the
RBI Act, it is clear that the Central Government is not bound to
accept the recommendation of the Central Board.               The word
‘may’ used therein, postulates exercise of discretion and,
therefore,   the   discretion   so     exercised   by   the    Central
Government must be exercised after considering the matter
carefully, as to whether the recommendation of the RBI is
Vivek Narayan Sharma vs Union Of India on 2 January, 2023
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/164842744/
14
required to be accepted or not.
25. Learned Senior Counsel, therefore, submits that it is
implicit in sub-section (2) of Section 26 of the RBI Act that the
                                  19
�Central Board constituted under Section 8 of the RBI Act must
devote sufficient time to apply their mind while making a
recommendation,     particularly      when   a   major   step   like
demonetization is to be taken.
26. Learned Senior Counsel submits that, however, in the
present case, the decision-making process is deeply flawed. He
submits that, under Section 8 of the RBI Act, the only channel
for non-government Directors to come on the Central Board of
the RBI is through clause (c) of sub-section (1) of Section 8 of
the RBI Act. He submits that, usually, experts in trade and
commerce, economists, industrialists, etc. are nominated in the
said category. However, on the date on which the decision for
demonetization was taken by the Central Board i.e. 8th
November, 2016, there were only 3 independent Directors
under clause (c) of sub-section (1) of Section 8 of the RBI Act.
He submits that, it is thus clear that, at the relevant time, the
Central Board consisted of a majority of the Directors who were
representatives of the Central Government inasmuch as there
                                 20
�were 7 vacancies of Directors in category under clause (c) of
sub-section (1) of Section 8 of the RBI Act.
27. Learned Senior Counsel further submits that, in the
Vivek Narayan Sharma vs Union Of India on 2 January, 2023
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/164842744/
15
present case, a reverse mechanism was adopted. He submits
that it was the Central Government which initiated the proposal
for demonetization and sought opinion of the Central Board
vide its communication dated 7th November 2016. The meeting
of the Central Board was held immediately on the next day i.e.
8th   November    2016    at   5.00   p.m.     Within   hours,   a
recommendation of the Central Board was sent to the Central
Government and, on the same date itself, i.e. 8th November
2016, the Hon’ble Prime Minister announced the decision of the
Cabinet with regard to demonetization on National Television at
8.00 p.m.
28. Learned Senior Counsel submits that, unless the following
documents are produced by the respondents, it cannot be
verified as to whether the Central Board while recommending
                                21
�demonetization or as to whether the Central Government while
deciding to notify demonetization had taken into consideration
the relevant factors or eschewed irrelevant factors:
     a)   The letter of the Central Government dated 7th
          November 2016;
     b)   The Agenda Note dated 8th November 2016, if any,
          placed before the Central Board of RBI and the
          relevant    research        papers,   background   notes,
          information, data, report, etc.;
     c)   The recommendation of the Central Board dated 8th
Vivek Narayan Sharma vs Union Of India on 2 January, 2023
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/164842744/
16
          November 2016 to the Central Government;
     d)   The Note for Cabinet, if any, that was placed before
          the Cabinet on 8th November 2016;
     e)   The actual decision of the Cabinet as recorded in the
          Minutes of the Cabinet of its meeting dated 8th
          November 2016.
29. It is submitted that it is only on the perusal of the minutes
of the meeting dated 8th November 2016, of the Central Board,
                                 22
�it could be seen as to whether the requisite quorum was there
or not and as to whether one director from the category under
Section 8(1)(c) of the RBI Act as required under the Reserve
Bank of India (General) Regulations, 1949 (hereinafter referred
to as “the 1949 Regulations”) was present in the meeting or not.
30. Shri Chidambaram submits that there is no record
available to show that there was application of mind to the
relevant factors by the Central Board, so also by the Central
Government. He submits that it is also not clear as to whether
there was any Cabinet note based on the recommendation of
the Central Board, which was placed before the Cabinet for
consideration.   He submits that the Hon’ble Prime Minister
went on National Television at 8.00 p.m. on 8th November 2016,
in a slot that had already been booked by the Government since
all channels telecasted the speech at 8.00 p.m., and announced
the decision on demonetization. He submits that the decision-
making process was pre-meditated and rushed, which depicted
Vivek Narayan Sharma vs Union Of India on 2 January, 2023
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/164842744/
17
a non-application of mind and was deeply and fatally flawed. It
                               23
�is thus submitted that the procedure adopted was in total
violation of the procedure contemplated under sub-section (2)
of Section 26 of the RBI Act.
31. Shri Chidambaram further submits that neither the RBI
nor the Central Government took into consideration the
relevant factors and eschewed irrelevant factors before making
such a far-reaching recommendation and decision respectively,
that would have serious consequences. He submits that, as a
result of demonetization, 86.4% of the currency (by value) was
declared no longer to be legal tender and was eventually
withdrawn. He submits that, in terms of absolute value, it
amounted to Rs.15,44,000 crore. It is submitted that 2,300
crore distinct notes had become illegal overnight.        It is
submitted that, at the relevant time, the notes in the
denomination of Rs.500/- and Rs.1,000/- were commonly used
and, since they were demonetized overnight, millions of people
were left with no valid bank notes to buy essential goods, such
as, food, milk or even medicines, etc.   Thousands of families
                                24
�went without a meal. In fact, various voluntary organizations
distributed free food to thousands of families during the
relevant period.
32. Shri     Chidambaram         submits   that    the     result   of
demonetization     was   disastrous.       It   resulted   in   steep
Vivek Narayan Sharma vs Union Of India on 2 January, 2023
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/164842744/
18
unemployment within a short period. Wages were not paid for
several weeks. Millions of farmers were unable to withdraw or
deposit money.     They did not have money to buy seeds or
fertilizers or to hire labour.   It is submitted that the price of
agricultural products dropped to a huge extent, thereby
causing loss to the farmers.
33. Shri Chidambaram submits that the Government also did
not take into consideration the fact that over 2 lakh ATMs were
required to be recalibrated to dispense the newly issued notes.
It is submitted that the Government, as also the RBI, also did
not take into consideration that, out of 1,38,626 bank branches
in India, over two-thirds were located in metropolitan, urban
                                  25
�and semi-urban areas, while only one-third were located in
rural areas, and that 90% of all ATMs were located merely in 16
States. He submits that the seven States in North-East India
had only 5199 ATMs, of which 3645 were in Assam alone. As a
result thereof, the individuals residing in rural areas and those
in the Northeast region were disproportionately and adversely
impacted.   They had to travel long distances and stand in
queues to exchange notes, forsaking their livelihood at
considerable expense.
34. Learned Senior Counsel submits that, without taking into
consideration all these factors, the Central Board made the
recommendation and the Central Government took the decision
Vivek Narayan Sharma vs Union Of India on 2 January, 2023
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/164842744/
19
of demonetization. It is submitted that the consequence thereof
is that demonetization cost the economy about 1-2% of the
GDP, i.e. about Rs.1,50,000 crore.
35. Shri Chidambaram further submits that the objectives
stated in the impugned Notification were false and illusory
                               26
�which could not have been achieved and which, in fact, were
not achieved.   He submits that one of the objectives was to
weed out fake currency notes that were causing adverse effect
on the economy.   Another objective was to stop the use of high
denomination bank notes for the storage of unaccounted
wealth.   Learned Senior Counsel submits that, when a fake
currency note is detected by a Bank Officer, he is obliged to
impound it, report it and give the same to the RBI. The RBI is
required to destroy the note, thus taking the fake currency note
out of possible circulation.   It is submitted that the Annual
Report of the RBI for the year 2016-2017 reported that only
fake currency of the value of Rs.43.3 crore was detected in the
nearly Rs.15.31 lakh crore of currency exchanged through the
banking system. It is submitted that this represented 0.0028%
of the total currency notes that were returned/exchanged
through the banking system/RBI.
36. Learned Senior Counsel submitted that, in fact, the Indian
Express quoted a senior Directorate of Revenue Intelligence
                               27
Vivek Narayan Sharma vs Union Of India on 2 January, 2023
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/164842744/
20
�(DRI) official who said that, while fake currency seized before
demonetization was of low quality and easily identifiable by the
naked eye, the quality of fake notes considerably improved
post-demonetization, making it harder to identify.           It is
submitted that, as such, it is clearly seen that the said objective
was false and, in any case, demonetization hopelessly failed to
achieve the said objectives.
37. Learned Senior Counsel further submitted that the third
objective was to arrest the use of fake currency for financing
subversive activities such as drug trafficking and terrorism,
which cause damage to the economy and the security of the
country.   In this respect, learned Senior Counsel submits that
new notes of denominational value of Rs.2,000/- were found on
the bodies of two terrorists killed in an encounter in Bandipora
on 22nd November 2016. Learned Senior Counsel submits that
nearly 99.3% of the demonetized notes were returned, whether
they represented storage of accounted or unaccounted wealth.
It is submitted that to facilitate the exchange of money, several
                                28
�brokers sprung up, who offered to exchange ‘demonetized’ notes
for a price.        As such, even honest people turned dishonest to
make some money.
38. Learned Senior Counsel submits that, shortly after
demonetization, the Income Tax Department and the DRI
conducted searches and raids and seized alleged unaccounted
wealth in the form of Rs.2,000 notes. It is, therefore, submitted
Vivek Narayan Sharma vs Union Of India on 2 January, 2023
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/164842744/
21
that all the stated objectives have utterly failed.
39. Shri       P.     Chidambaram    further   submitted   that   the
impugned Notification is liable to be set aside on another
ground also.         He submits that the doctrine of proportionality
has now been recognised in Indian jurisprudence. Applying the
test of proportionality to the impugned act of demonetization,
he submits that there was absolutely no justification to
demonetize 86.4% of the currency in circulation representing a
value of Rs.15,44,000 crore that caused enormous damage to
the economy and placed an intolerable and horrendous burden
                                    29
�upon the people of the country, especially the poor.      It is
submitted that, before resorting to such a drastic step, the
Central Board as well as the Central Government ought to have
taken into consideration as to whether an alternative method
could have been resorted to achieve the purpose for which the
exercise of demonetization was done. In this respect, learned
Senior Counsel relied on the judgment of this Court in the case
of K.S. Puttaswamy (Retired) and another (Aadhaar) v.
Union of India and another3 and Internet and Mobile
Association of India v. Reserve Bank of India4.
40. Learned Senior Counsel submitted that though, while
exercising the power of judicial review, it may not be
permissible for this Court to examine the correctness of the
decision, however, this Court can very well exercise its powers
to examine the correctness of the decision-making process. He
Vivek Narayan Sharma vs Union Of India on 2 January, 2023
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/164842744/
22
submits that the decision-making process in the present case is
3totally flawed. He submits that neither the Central Board while

    (2020) 10 SCC 274
                              30
�making the recommendation nor the Central Government while
taking the decision have followed the procedure as prescribed
in sub-section (2) of Section 26 of the RBI Act.           He submits
that, in any case, they have failed to take into consideration the
relevant    factors   which   were    required   to   be   taken   into
consideration and have taken into consideration those factors
which were false from the very inception and have subsequently
been proved to be so.    He, therefore, submits that this Court is
entitled to exercise its powers of judicial review and hold that
the decision-making process was not sustainable in law.             In
this respect, learned Senior Counsel relied on the judgments of
this Court in the cases of Tata Cellular v. Union of India5,
Uttamrao Shivdas Jankar v. Ranjitsinh Vijaysinh Mohite
Patil6, Centre for Public Interest litigation and others v.
Union of India and others7, Lt. General Manomoy Ganguly

Vsm v. Union of India and others8 and K.S. Puttaswamy
(Retired) and another (Aadhaar) (supra).
41. Learned Senior Counsel further submitted that, despite
the passage of time, this Court has the power to grant
declaratory relief including the relief of declaring as to what is
the true meaning and interpretation of various provisions of the
RBI Act and also to mould the relief accordingly.        Learned
Senior Counsel relied on the judgment of this Court in the case
of Somaiya Organics (India) Ltd. and another v. State of
U.P. and another9, Orissa Cement Ltd. v. State of Orissa
and others10, and I.C. Golak Nath & Others v. State of
Punjab & Another11 in support of the said submissions.
42. Learned Senior Counsel further submitted that the
impugned Notification is also violative of Article 19(1)(g) of the
Constitution of India. He submits that, if it is the contention of
8the State that the restriction imposed is reasonable and in the

�interest of the general public, then the burden is on the
respondents to establish the same.      However, in the present
case, the respondents have failed to do so. He further submits
Vivek Narayan Sharma vs Union Of India on 2 January, 2023
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/164842744/
24
that this Court in the case of Jayantilal Ratanchand Shah v.
Reserve Bank of India and others12 has held the currency
notes to be property. He, therefore, submits that depriving a
person of his property by demonetization would be violative of
Article 300A of the Constitution of India.
43. Shri Shyam Divan, learned Senior Counsel appearing on
behalf of the applicant-Malvinder Singh, submitted that, apart
from the guarantee given by the Central Government with
regard to exchange of every bank note as legal tender at any
place in India, they are also the liabilities of the Issue
Department under Section 34 of the RBI Act to an amount
equal to the total of the amount of the currency notes of the
Government of India and bank notes for the time being in
circulation.

Minister, in his speech on 8th November 2016, gave a
categorical assurance that the rights and interests of honest,
hard-working people would be fully protected.        A specific
assurance was also given that if there may be some who, for
some reason, are not able to deposit their old five hundred or
one thousand rupee notes by 30th December 2016, they could
go to specified offices of the RBI upto 31st March 2017 and
deposit the notes after submitting a declaration form.       He
Vivek Narayan Sharma vs Union Of India on 2 January, 2023
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/164842744/
25
submits that a person of a stature no less than the Hon’ble
Prime Minister of India has given an assurance that such
persons would be able to go to specified offices of the RBI upto
31st March 2017 and deposit the notes after submitting a
declaration form. It is further submitted that in the Press Note
published on the same day, i.e. 8th November 2016, an
assurance was given to the following effect:
          “(x) For those who are unable to

�             bank accounts on or before December
             30, 2016, an opportunity will be given to
             them to do so at specified offices of the
             RBI on later dates along with necessary
             documentation as may be specified by
             the Reserve Bank of India.”
45. Learned Senior Counsel submits that the said assurance
was also reiterated in the RBI Notice dated 8th November 2016.
Learned       Senior    Counsel,        therefore,   submits       that
applicant’s/petitioner’s case (petitioner in Writ Petition (Civil)
No.149 of 2017) stands on peculiar facts. Shri Divan submits
that   the    applicant/petitioner      withdrew     an   amount     of
Rs.1,20,000/- from his bank account operating in Central
Cooperative Bank, Sangrur, Punjab (Branch-Ghelan) on 3rd
December 2015 and kept the same with his previous savings of
Rs.42,000/- in cash, which totals to Rs.1,62,000/- (i.e. 60
notes of Rs. 500 denomination and 132 notes of Rs.1000/-
denomination). On 11th April, 2016, he went to visit his son
Vivek Narayan Sharma vs Union Of India on 2 January, 2023
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/164842744/
26
residing in the USA, leaving his above mentioned saving of
Rs.1,62,000/- at home in India for his future knee operation.
                                   35
�The applicant travelled with his wife.    During their absence,
their home was locked and the money could not have been
deposited.   Learned   Senior   Counsel   submits    that,   after
returning to India on 3rd February, 2017, and relying on the
assurance given by the Hon’ble Prime Minister of India, he
made a representation to the RBI for exchange of the currency
notes in his possession. However, the same was not considered,
thus constraining him to file a writ petition (i.e. Writ Petition
(Civil) No.149 of 2017).    This Court, vide order dated 3 rd
November 2017 disposed of the said writ petition giving him the
liberty to file an application for intervention/impleadment in
Writ Petition (Civil) No.906 of 2016 (Vivek Narayan Sharma vs.
Union of India), which was accordingly filed him vide I.A.
No.26757 of 2018 in Writ Petition (Civil) No.906 of 2016.
46. Shri Divan submits that the proviso to the Notification
dated 30th December 2016 issued by the Ministry of Finance,
Department of Economic Affairs, Government of India, totally
excludes persons like the applicant. He submits that, only on
                                36
�account of the number of days residing abroad, the applicant
was categorized as non-resident Indian and as such, he was
only entitled to exchange currency notes to the extent as
Vivek Narayan Sharma vs Union Of India on 2 January, 2023
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/164842744/
27
provided in the proviso to the Notification dated 30th December
2016. Learned Senior Counsel submits that, however, the
applicant had not carried the cash while travelling abroad and
as such, there was no question of making a declaration under
clause (i) of sub-section (1) of Section 4 of the 2016 Notification.
47. Learned Senior Counsel further submitted that, in view of
clause (ii) of sub-section (1) of Section 4 of the 2017 Act, the
Central Government is empowered to provide a grace period to
such class of persons and for such reasons as may be specified,
by notification. He submits that the said power is coupled with
a duty. It is, therefore, submitted that when there are genuine
cases, the Central Government is bound to exercise the power
under clause (ii) of sub-section (1) of Section 4 of the 2017 Act
and provide grace period to the applicant and persons like him.
                                 37
d8. Shri Divan further submits that the Circular of the RBI
dated 31st December 2016 is also discriminatory, inasmuch as
in the case of Resident Indians, there is no monetary limit for
tender of SBNs. However, insofar as the Non-Resident Indians
(NRIs) are concerned, the tender is restricted to a maximum of
Rs.25,000/- per individual depending on when the notes were
taken out of India as per relevant FEMA Rules.          Learned
counsel submits that an additional liability is imposed upon the
NRIs to produce a certificate issued by the Indian Customs on
arrival through Red Channel after 30th December 2016,
indicating the import of SBNs, with details and value thereof.

49. Shri Divan relied on the article titled “Using Fast
Frequency Household Survey Data to Estimate the Impact of
Demonetization on Employment” by Mr. Mahesh Vyas, Centre
for Monitoring Indian Economy (2018) in support of his
submission that on account of demonetization, there was
substantial reduction in employment, which was about 12
million lower than it was during the 2 months preceding
                               38
�demonetization. And, over a 4-month period when the entire
sample was surveyed, the impact of demonetization reduced to
a loss of about 3 million jobs. He submits that an article in the
Indian Express dated 17th January 2017 based on a study
conducted by the All India Manufacturers’ Organisation (AIMO),
indicated   that   the   manufacturing   sector   suffered   from
considerable job loss post-demonetization.
50. Learned Senior Counsel also submits that in the absence
of a specific study with regard to the effect of demonetization on
the Indian economy, the decision of the Central Government for
demonetizing about 86.4% of the total currency in circulation
will have to be held to be vitiated on account of manifest
arbitrariness. It is submitted that the impugned notification is
also liable to be set aside applying the test of proportionality.
Applying the classical equality test, he submits that it will have
to be held that the decision of demonetization had no nexus to
the objectives to be achieved. Learned Senior Counsel relies on
the judgment of the Constitution Bench of this Court in the
Vivek Narayan Sharma vs Union Of India on 2 January, 2023

�case of K.S. Puttaswamy (Retired) and another (Aadhaar)
(supra) in this regard.
51. Shri Divan lastly submits that the right to life also
includes the right to live with dignity.        Relying on the
Constitution Bench judgment of this Court in the case of
Maneka Gandhi v. Union of India13, he submits that the right
to live with dignity also includes the right to travel abroad,
especially to visit the son of the petitioner/applicant in the
USA. He, therefore, submits that when the applicant/petitioner
had gone to the USA to visit his son during the period wherein
the currency notes could have been exchanged, he will be
deprived of his right under Article 21 of the Constitution of
India if he is not granted an opportunity now to exchange the
demonetized notes with the new notes.
IV.      SUBMISSIONS OF UNION OF INDIA

                               40
�impugned notification stands ratified by the 2017 Act.    It is,
therefore, submitted that with the executive action being
validated by the will of Parliament, the challenge to the same
would not survive.

53. The learned A.G. submits that the word “any” appearing
before the words “series of bank notes” in sub-section (2) of
Section 26 of the RBI Act should be construed as “all”. Learned
A.G. relies on the following judgments of this Court in support
of his submission that the word “any” will have to be construed
to be “all”.

       of Enforcement and another19
54. The learned A.G. submits that the action under sub-
section (2) of Section 26 of the RBI Act cannot be construed in a
narrow compass.        It is submitted that various factors, aspects

Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/164842744/
31
and challenging confrontations affecting the economic system
of the country and its stability will have to be given due
weightage while considering the validity of the action taken
under sub-section (2) of Section 26 of the RBI Act.
55. The learned A.G. submits that the comparison of the
action taken under sub-section (2) of Section 26 of the RBI Act
with the 1946 and the 1978 legislations is totally misconceived.
It is submitted that, in any case, the 2017 Act not only

18
   (2008) 11 SCC 573

�addresses the issues relating to cessation of legal tender under
sub-section (2) of Section 26 of the RBI Act, but also provides
for exchange of bank notes in order that Article 300A of the
Constitution of India is complied with, and also extinguishes
the liabilities of the Issue Department of the RBI under Section
34 of the RBI Act.
56. The learned A.G. submits that if the construction as
advanced by the petitioners is accepted, then the very purpose
for which the provision is made shall stand frustrated.     The
learned A.G., relying on the judgment of this Court in the case
of C.I.T. v. S. Teja Singh20, submits that it is a settled
principle of law that the Courts will strongly lean against a
construction of a provision which will render it futile.   It is
submitted that the bolder construction, based on the view that

32
Parliament would legislate only for the purpose of bringing
about an effective result, is required to be accepted.
20
     AIR 1959 SC 352
                                43
e7. The learned A.G. submits that the argument that the word
“any” would not mean “all” is fallacious in nature. If the same
is accepted, the Government would technically be permitted to
issue separate notifications for each series but would be
prohibited from issuing a common notification for all series. It
is submitted that if such process is held to be permitted, it
would lead to chaos and uncertainty.
58. The learned A.G. further submits that the word “any” has
been used at two places in sub-section (2) of Section 26 of the
RBI Act.   It is submitted that the word “any” preceding the
words “series of bank notes” has to be construed to mean “all”,
whereas the word “any” preceding the word “denomination”
may be construed to be singular or otherwise. He submits that
the same word used in the same provision twice could be
permitted to have a different meaning.       He relies on the
                               44
�judgment of this Court in the case of Maharaj Singh v. State
of Uttar Pradesh and others21 in support of his submission.
59. The learned A.G. submits that the alternative submission
Vivek Narayan Sharma vs Union Of India on 2 January, 2023
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/164842744/
33
that if the word “any” is not given any restricted meaning then
sub-section (2) of Section 26 of the RBI Act will have to be held
to be invalid on the ground of vesting of excessive delegation, is
also without substance. The learned A.G. submits that the RBI
is not just like any other statutory body created by an Act of
legislature. It is submitted that it is a creature created with a
mandate to get liberated even from its creator. It is submitted
that the guiding factors for exercise of power under sub-section
(2) of Section 26 of the RBI Act have to be found from Section 3
of the RBI Act as well as from its preamble. It is submitted that
the RBI Act was enacted for the purposes of taking over the
management and regulation of the currency from the Central
Government as per Section 3 of the RBI Act. The preamble of
the RBI Act also states that the RBI has been constituted to
21
     (1977) 1 SCC 155
                                45
�“regulate the issue of bank notes”.                  It is submitted that the
words “taking over the management of the currency” in Section
3 of the RBI Act and “regulate” in the Preamble have to be given
the widest possible import.                It is submitted that a narrower
construction would defeat the very purpose of the RBI Act. It is
submitted         that   the    word       “regulate”      would   also   include
“prohibit”.
60. The learned A.G., relying on the judgment of this Court in
the case of Municipal Corporation of Delhi v. Birla Cotton,
Vivek Narayan Sharma vs Union Of India on 2 January, 2023
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/164842744/
34
Spinning and Weaving Mills, Delhi and another22 submits
that, in order to find out as to whether the legislature has given
guidance for exercise of delegated powers, the Court will have
to consider the provisions of the particular Act with which the
Court has to deal with, including its preamble. It is submitted
that the preamble of the RBI Act read with Section 3 thereof
provides        sufficient     guidance         to   the    delegatee     Central
Government for exercising its powers. It is further submitted

     AIR 1968 SC 1232 : (1968) 3 SCR 251
                                           46
�that, while considering the question as to whether the
delegation is excessive or not, the nature of the body to which
delegation is made is also a factor to be taken into
consideration.   It is submitted that in the present case, the
delegation is to the Central Government and not to any
subordinate office or department.
61. The learned A.G. submitted that the judgment of this
Court in the case of Harakchand Ratanchand Banthia and
others (supra) would not be applicable to the facts of the
present case inasmuch as in the said case, the delegation was
to an Administrator and this Court found that the delegation to
the Administrator was too wide and, thus, suffered from the
vice of excessive delegation. It is submitted that, similarly, the
judgment of this Court in the case of Hamdard Dawakhana
(Wakf) Lal Kuan, Delhi and another (supra) also would not

Vivek Narayan Sharma vs Union Of India on 2 January, 2023
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/164842744/
37
the impugned action being susceptible to challenge on the
ground of proportionality is concerned, the learned A.G.
submits that the reliance placed on the judgment of this Court
in the case of Internet and Mobile Association of India
(supra) is wholly misconceived. Relying on various paragraphs
from the said judgment, the learned A.G. submits that the
observations made in paragraph 224 of the said judgment have
to be read in context with the issue that fell for consideration
before this Court in the said case. It is submitted that in the
said case, this Court was considering the action of the RBI in
restricting the banks and financial institutions regulated by it
from providing access to banking services to those engaged in
transactions in crypto assets. It is submitted that, though this
Court held that, in view of the provisions contained in the RBI
Act, the Banking Regulation Act, 1949 and the Payment and
Settlement Systems Act, 2007, and also in view of the special
place and role that the RBI has in the economy of the country,
                               50
�the RBI had very wide and ample powers to take preventive and
curable measures. However, this Court found that applying the
test of proportionality, in the absence of the RBI pointing out
some semblance of any damage suffered by its regulatory
entities, the action was not sustainable.                The learned A.G.
submitted that the action in the present case was taken after
considering the relevant factors and to address serious
concerns such as terror financing, black money and fake
Vivek Narayan Sharma vs Union Of India on 2 January, 2023

38
currency. It is, therefore, submitted that the judgment of this
Court in the case of Internet and Mobile Association of India
(supra) would not be applicable to the facts of the present case.
65. The learned A.G., relying on the judgment of this Court in
the case of State of Tamil Nadu and another v. National
South           Indian           River    Interlinking      Agriculturist
Association36, submitted that in a case of non-classificatory
arbitrariness, the test of proportionality would be applicable.
However, in a case of classificatory arbitrariness, the only test
36
     (2021) SCC OnLine SC 1114
                                         51
�that will have to be satisfied is the rational nexus test, i.e.
whether the action taken has a reasonable nexus with the
object to be achieved. In such a case, the proportionality test
would not be applicable. It is submitted that the present case
would fall in the latter category and not in the former category.
66. Countering     the   argument    made    on   behalf   of   the
petitioners that the power exercised under sub-section (2) of
Section 26 of the RBI Act has not been exercised in the manner
as provided therein and further that the decision-making
process is flawed on account of patent arbitrariness, the
learned A.G. submitted that in view of the settled legal position,
the said contention is also not tenable.    It is submitted that
what is postulated under sub-section (2) of Section 26 of the
RBI Act is that the Central Government may take a decision on
Vivek Narayan Sharma vs Union Of India on 2 January, 2023
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/164842744/
39
the recommendation of the Central Board. It is submitted that
in the present case, there was, in fact, a recommendation by
the Central Board recommending demonetization. The decision
by the Central Government has been taken after considering
                                52
�the said recommendation. It is, therefore, submitted that the
procedure as provided in sub-section (2) of Section 26 of the
RBI Act stands duly complied with.              The learned A.G.
submitted that the RBI is not only an expert body but a very
special institution charged with a duty of conceiving and
implementing various facets of economic and monetary policy.
It is submitted that there cannot be a straitjacket formula in
the discharge of its duty.       Learned A.G. submits that in any
case, it is a settled law that this Court should not interfere with
the opinion of experts and leave it to experts who are more
familiar with the problems they face. Reliance in this respect is
placed on the judgment of this Court in the case of Rajbir
Singh Dalal (Dr.) v. Chaudhari Devi Lal University, Sirsa
and        another37    and   Secretary   and   Curator,   Victoria
Memorial Hall v. Howrah Ganatantrik Nagrik Samity and

f7. Relying on the judgment of this Court in the case of Bajaj
Hindustan Limited v. Sir Shadi Lal Enterprises Limited
and another39, the learned A.G. submits that economic and
fiscal regulatory measures are a field where Judges should
encroach upon very warily as Judges are not experts in these
matters.
68. The learned A.G. submitted that the recommendation of
the RBI and the decision of the Central Government was taken
after taking into consideration that fake currency notes of the
SBNs have largely been in circulation and it was difficult to
identify genuine bank notes from the fake ones and to also
address three serious problems viz., fake currency notes,
storage of unaccounted wealth and terror financing.       It is
submitted that the material with regard to such factors cannot
be considered overnight. It is submitted that the 2012 White
Paper on Black Money throws light on the complexity of the
problem.         The information and data gathered from various
39
     (2011) 1 SCC 640
                                  54
�agencies of the Government of India are required to be taken
into consideration. It is submitted that both the RBI and the
Central Government act in coordination with each other. The
learned A.G. submits that the discussions over the issue have
taken place over a long period of time and, after considering all
the aspects, the RBI recommended demonetization and the
Vivek Narayan Sharma vs Union Of India on 2 January, 2023

41
Central Government took the decision to demonetize.
69. The learned A.G. further submitted that the contention of
the petitioners that demonetization has utterly failed to achieve
its objectives as stated in the impugned Notification is also
without   substance.   The   learned     A.G.   submits   that   the
repercussion of an action like the one under consideration can
be best understood by considering the legal tender cessation
measure not in isolation but by looking at the overall benefits
flowing from such a measure.         The learned A.G. submits that
the benefits and advantages of such an action are direct as well
as indirect.   The learned A.G. submits that, as a result of the
impugned action, there are direct benefits, like:

�(i)     significant reduction in fake currency;
(ii)    significant increase in the number of tax payers;
(iii)   25% growth in filing income-tax returns;
(iv)    significant increase in returns filed by corporate tax
        payers;
(v)     substantial growth in new PAN numbers.
70. The learned A.G. submits that, whereas self-assessment
tax in the year 2015-16 was Rs.55,000 crore and Rs.68,000
crore in the year 2016-2017, it has jumped to Rs.1,00,000
crore in the year 2017-18. The learned A.G. further submitted
that, as a direct benefit of demonetization, the volume of
Unified Payments Interface (UPI) transactions shot up from
Vivek Narayan Sharma vs Union Of India on 2 January, 2023

42
1.06 crore in 2016-2017 to 90.5 crore in 2017-18 and further
to about 5000 crore in 2021-22.            The value of the UPI
transactions also grew 1210 times in 2021-22 as compared to
2016-17.      It is submitted that the real GDP growth in the year
                                  56
b017-18 was higher than the average annual growth of 6.6% in
the decade (2010-11 to 2019-20).
71. The learned A.G. further submitted that there have also
been various indirect benefits. Action against domestic black
money resulted in undisclosed income of Rs.82,168 crores.
Surveys conducted in 63,691 cases led to undisclosed income
of Rs.84,396 crores getting deducted. The employees provident
fund organization (EPFO) enrolment data saw an increase of
1.1 crore new enrolments.        It also saw 55% increase in
Employees’ State Insurance Corporation (ESIC) registrations. It
is, therefore, submitted that if the effect of impugned action is
considered in a larger perspective, it will clearly show that there
have been several direct as well as indirect benefits on account
of the demonetization.
72. The learned A.G. further submitted that, merely because
in 1946 and 1978 the demonetization was effected by
enactments of Parliament, cannot be a ground to hold that the
                                57
�Central Government does not have a power under sub-section
(2) of Section 26 of the RBI Act. It is submitted that, in any
Vivek Narayan Sharma vs Union Of India on 2 January, 2023
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/164842744/
43
case, the said argument does not hold water inasmuch as what
has been provided under the impugned notification is wholly
ratified by the 2017 Act. It is submitted that once the executive
action is ratified by Parliament by way of legislation, the
argument that since Parliament had chosen to do so in 1946
and 1978, the Central Government could not have done it
under the impugned notification itself is contradictory.
73. The learned A.G. submits that the perusal of the
Parliamentary debates while enacting the 1978 Act would
clearly   show   that,   though    by   the   said   Act   only   high
denomination bank notes of the denominational value of
Rs.1,000/-, Rs.5,000/- and Rs.10,000/- were demonetized, the
Members of Parliament advocated for demonetization of even
the bank notes of the denominational value of Rs.100.
74. The learned A.G. submits that the provisions of the 1978
Act have been found to be constitutional by the Constitution
                                  58
�Bench Judgment of this Court in the case of Jayantilal
Ratanchand Shah (supra). It is submitted that, for the
reasoning adopted by the Constitution Bench in the said case,
the impugned notification, which now stands ratified by the
2017 Act, also deserves to be upheld.
75. In respect of the submission made on behalf of the
petitioners, that in order to address concern of the genuine
difficulties of various persons who could not deposit the
demonetized bank notes within the limited period, a window
Vivek Narayan Sharma vs Union Of India on 2 January, 2023
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/164842744/
44
should be opened for a limited period; the learned A.G.
submitted that if such is permitted, it would amount to
devising a norm which will alter the essential character of the
enactment.     It is submitted that, firstly, it is difficult to
ascertain genuineness of the money. Such a request will have
to be based on certain declarations being made by the party
whose veracity cannot be verified.      It is submitted that this
would also provide a loophole for non-genuine bank note
holders to channelize their unaccounted money through the
                              59
�window.   It is submitted that, incidentally, the law enforcing
agencies are still recovering significant amount of SBNs from
the individuals.
76. The learned A.G. further submitted that, as of now,
Rs.10,719 crore of SBNs are still in circulation. It is submitted
that in any case, in view of the provisions of clause (i) of sub-
section (1) of Section 4 of the 2017 Act, 77,748 applications
involving an amount of Rs.284.25 crore were received from
resident and non-resident Indians by the five designated
Regional Offices of the RBI during the grace period. Out of this,
a total of 57,405 cases (74% of the total applications received)
amounting to Rs.221.95 crore (78% of the total amount under
these applications) have been accepted and the amounts have
been credited to their KYC compliant bank accounts.         It is
submitted that out of the total cases, 20,343 cases were
rejected due to various reasons.     The learned A.G. submits
Vivek Narayan Sharma vs Union Of India on 2 January, 2023
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/164842744/
45
that it will not be permissible for the Court to devise a norm
which would result in altering the essential character of the
                               60
�enactment.        In support of this submission, he relies on the
judgment of United States Supreme Court in the case of
Metropolis Theater Company et al v. City of Chicago and
Ernest J. Magerstadt40.
77. The learned A.G. lastly submits that the Court must not
proceed for a formal judgment when it cannot grant any
effectual relief. In this respect, he relies on the judgments of
United States Supreme Court in the cases of North Carolina v.
Wayne Claude RICE41 and Mills v. Green42 and the judgment
of the Court of Appeal of New York in the case of People ex rel.
Kingsland v. Clark43.
78. Taking the line further, the learned A.G. submits that it is
also a settled proposition of law that the Court should not
decide academic questions.              In this respect, he relies on the
judgment of this Court in the cases of Shrimanth Balasaheb

V.    SUBMISSIONS OF THE RBI
79. Shri Jaideep Gupta, learned Senior Counsel appearing on
behalf of the RBI, would submit that the contention of the
petitioners that the power under sub-section (2) of Section 26 of
the RBI Act is uncanalised, unguided and arbitrary is without
any basis. He submits that sub-section (2) of Section 26 of the
RBI Act itself provides that the power by the Central
Government has to be exercised on the recommendation of the
Central Board.        It is, therefore, submitted that there is an
inbuilt safeguard in the provision itself.
80. Relying on the judgment of this Court in the case of
Peerless General Finance and Investment Co. Limited and
44
   (2020) 2 SCC 595
45
   (1997) 8 SCC 31

                                  62
another v. Reserve Bank of India47, it is submitted that the
RBI, which is a bankers’ bank, has a large contingent of experts
to render advice relating to matters affecting the economy of the
entire country. It is submitted that the RBI plays an important
role in the economy and financial affairs of India and one of its
Vivek Narayan Sharma vs Union Of India on 2 January, 2023
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/164842744/
47
important functions is to regulate the banking system in the
country. It is submitted that the recommendation of the Central
Board is based upon the advice of the experts that the RBI has
in its contingent. Shri Gupta also relies on the judgment of the
Constitution Bench of this Court in the case of Joseph
Kuruvilla Velukunnel v. Reserve Bank of India and
others48 in support of this submission.
81. Shri Gupta further submitted that the contention that the
decision-making process is faulty on account of not following
the procedure under sub-section (2) of Section 26 of the RBI
Act is also without substance.      The learned Senior Counsel
submits that the procedure under sub-section (2) of Section 26
47
     (1992) 2 SCC 343
48
     1962 Supp (3) SCR 632
                               63
�of the RBI Act contemplates two things i.e. recommendation of
the Central Board and the decision by the Central Government.
It is submitted that both these requirements stand fully
satisfied in the present case. He submits that though it is the
contention of the petitioners that the procedure is flawed,
however, the petition itself is bereft of such averments.   Shri
Gupta submits that the Constitution Bench of this Court in the
case of Ram Kishore Sen and others v. Union of India and
others49 has held that the burden of proof primarily lies on a
person who complains that the procedure prescribed has not
Vivek Narayan Sharma vs Union Of India on 2 January, 2023
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/164842744/
48
been followed. In any case, he submits that in both the
affidavits filed on behalf of the RBI i.e. the counter affidavit
dated 19th December 2018 filed by Haokholal, Assistant
General Manager and the additional affidavit dated 15th
November 2022 of Shri Kuntal Kaim, Deputy General Manager,
it has been specifically averred that the procedure as prescribed
under sub-section (2) of Section 26 of the RBI Act read with
49
     (1966) 1 SCR 430
                               64
�Regulation 8 of the 1949 Regulations was duly followed.       He
submits that the quorum as prescribed under the 1949
Regulations was very much available when the meeting of the
Central Board was held on 8th November 2016. In any case, it
is submitted that in view of sub-section (5) of Section 8 of the
RBI Act, a decision of the Board cannot be questioned merely
on the ground of existence of any vacancy or any defect in the
constitution of the Board.    The learned Senior Counsel has
placed on record an additional affidavit dated 6th December,
2022 reiterating the statements made in the aforesaid two
affidavits dated 19th December 2018 and 15th November 2022.
82. Relying on the judgment of this Court in the case of
Internet and Mobile Association of India (supra), Shri Gupta
submits that to consider the question of proportionality, a four-
pronged test, as set out in the judgment of this Court in the
case of Modern Dental College and Research Centre and
Vivek Narayan Sharma vs Union Of India on 2 January, 2023

49
                               65
Others v. State of Madhya Pradesh and Others50 is required
to be applied.          It is submitted that since the measure is
designated for the purpose of dealing with fake currency, black
money and terror funding, the first test stands satisfied. The
measure, i.e. demonetization, has a reasonable nexus for the
fulfillment of the purpose of aforesaid three objectives and, as
such, the second test is also fulfilled. Insofar as the third test
is concerned, it is submitted that it is a matter of economic
policy as to what measure is found to be appropriate for
achieving the objective of dealing with the menace of aforesaid
three evils. It is submitted that it is for the experts in the
economic and monetary fields to take a decision in that regard
and, as such, the third test, as to whether there was no
alternative less invasive measure, would not be applicable to a
decision pertaining to economic policy.      Insofar as the fourth
test is concerned, it is submitted that, as a matter of fact, there
has been no infringement of the rights of the citizens.       As a
50
     (2016) 7 SCC 353
                                   66
�matter of fact, no currency is being taken away. Full value of
the legitimate currency has been exchanged. It is submitted
that non-cash transactions such as credit card, debit card, on-
line transaction, etc. were permitted even during the period
Vivek Narayan Sharma vs Union Of India on 2 January, 2023
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/164842744/
50
between 8th November 2016 and 31st December 2016. In any
case, it is submitted that immediately after the demonetization
was notified, in spite of enormity of operations, immediate steps
were taken for the betterment of the public and to ensure
adequate cash supply. It is submitted that various measures
were taken in order to alleviate the genuine grievances of the
citizens, which have been enumerated in paragraphs 11 to 17
of the affidavit dated 19th December 2018 filed on behalf of the
RBI.   It is, therefore, submitted that the proportionality test
would not be applicable in the present case.
83. Shri Gupta relying on the judgment of this Court in the
case of Small Scale Industrial Manufactures Association
                               67
�(Registered) v. Union of India and others51 submits that
normally, it is not within the domain of any court to weigh the
pros and cons of the policy or to scrutinize it except only when
it is found to be arbitrary and violative of any constitutional or
any statutory provisions of law.
84. Shri Gupta further submits that a similar provision
providing for a specified time for exchange of notes has already
been found to be valid by the Constitution Bench of this Court
in the case of Jayantilal Ratanchand Shah (supra).             He
submits that the time provided in the present case is almost
similar to the time provided under the 1978 Act.        The said
period has been found to be reasonable having regard to the
purpose sought to be achieved by the said Act. It is, therefore,
Vivek Narayan Sharma vs Union Of India on 2 January, 2023
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/164842744/
51
submitted that the challenge that the period provided was not
sufficient is without any substance.       It is submitted that
everybody had sufficient opportunity either to deposit the notes
in their banks or to exchange the same. He further submits
51
     (2021) 8 SCC 511
                                68
�that it was not necessary even for the individuals to go to
Banks to exchange notes and on the prescribed procedure
being   followed,   an   authorized    representative    could   also
exchange the notes on their behalf.
85. Shri Gupta further submitted that the provisions of sub-
section (2) of Section 4 of the 2017 Act cannot be read in
isolation. He submits that if it is read in isolation, it will lead to
an anomalous situation where the RBI has an independent
power to act in violation of the provisions of Section 3 and sub-
section (1) of Section 4 of the 2017 Act.         He submits that
Section 3 and sub-sections (1) and (2) of Section 4 of the 2017
Act will have to be read together to hold that the power
available to the RBI under sub-section (2) of Section 4 of the
2017 Act is with regard to the grace period as provided under
sub-section (1) of Section 4 of the 2017 Act.        It is submitted
that the power vested in the Central Government under clause
(ii) of sub-section (1) of Section 4 of the 2017 Act is to provide
grace period to such class of persons and for such reasons as
Vivek Narayan Sharma vs Union Of India on 2 January, 2023

52
                                  69
�may be specified by notification. However, such power has not
been exercised by the Central Government and, therefore, it
cannot be construed that the RBI will have an independent
power in this regard.
86. Shri Gupta reiterated the submission made by the learned
A.G. that since the relief sought in the petitions cannot be
granted, no declaration as sought should be granted by this
Court. In this respect, he relies on the judgment of this Court
in      the   case      of   Bholanath      Mukherjee     and    others    v.
Ramakrishna Mission Vivekananda Centenary College and
others52.
VI.      SUBMISSIONS IN REJOINDER
87. Shri         P.     Chidambaram,        learned   Senior    Counsel,   in
rejoinder, almost reiterated his earlier submissions.                      He
submitted that there are two methods of demonetization of
currency, one is by legislative method and the other under sub-
section (2) of Section 26 of the RBI Act. He reiterated that the
52
     (2011) 5 SCC 464
                                       70
�word “any” will always have to be read in the context of the
provisions and if read in that manner, the only meaning that
can be given to the word “any” in sub-section (2) of Section 26
of the RBI is “some”. In this respect, he relies on the judgment
of this Court in the case of Union of India v. A.B. Shah and
Vivek Narayan Sharma vs Union Of India on 2 January, 2023
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/164842744/
53
others53.
88. Shri Chidambaram further submitted that from the
perusal of the affidavit filed on behalf of the Central
Government as well as the RBI, it is clear that the procedure
emanated from the Central Government, which was through
the advice given by the Government to the RBI in its
communication dated 7th November 2016. The affidavit would
clearly show that the RBI acted on the advice of the Central
Government and gave its recommendation in a mechanical
manner. He reiterated that, as per sub-section (2) of Section 26
of the RBI Act, the proposal has to emanate from the RBI and
not from the Central Government.      It is reiterated that the
53
     (1996) 8 SCC 540
                               71
�procedure is in total breach of sub-section (2) of Section 26 of
the RBI Act.
89. Shri Chidambaram submits that unless the documents, to
which he had already referred in his arguments while opening
the case, are placed for perusal of this Court, the Court cannot
come to a satisfaction about the correctness of the decision-
making process.         Relying on the judgment of this Court in the
case of R.K. Jain v. Union of India54, he submits that unless
the respondents plead privilege and the issue is decided, the
respondent cannot withhold the said documents, at least from
this Court.
Vivek Narayan Sharma vs Union Of India on 2 January, 2023
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/164842744/
54
90. Relying on an excerpt from “Forks in the Road: My Days at
RBI and Beyond”, a book by former RBI Governor C.
Rangarajan, Shri Chidambaram submits that demonetization
has nothing to do with monetary policy. Emphasizing on the
judgment of this Court in the case of Internet and Mobile
Association of India (supra), the learned Senior Counsel
54
     (1993) 4 SCC 119
                                    72
�submits that the proportionality test will have to be satisfied in
the present case.     It is submitted that the 2017 Act does not
validate the action taken under the impugned Notification. It
only extinguishes the liabilities of the Issue Department of the
RBI. The learned Senior Counsel, therefore, submits that this
is a fit case wherein this Court should decide the scope of sub-
section (2) of Section 26 of the RBI Act and declare that the
exercise of power by the Central Government under sub-section
(2) of Section 26 of the RBI Act was not valid in law. In this
respect, he relies on the judgment of this Court in the case of
S.R. Bommai and others v. Union of India and others55.
91. Shri Shyam Divan, learned Senior Counsel, in rejoinder,
submits that the perusal of sub-section (1) of Section 26 of the
RBI Act would reveal that, though the tendering of any series of
bank notes of any denomination ceases to be a legal one under
sub-section (2) of Section 26 of the RBI Act, the guarantee of
the Central Government continues to exist. It is submitted that

55
55
     (1994) 3 SCC 1
                                73
�it would be clear from the provisions contained in the 2016
Ordinance, which became the 2017 Act, that Section 3 of the
2017 Act which provides that the SBNs which have ceased to
be legal tender in view of the impugned notification, shall cease
to be liabilities of the RBI under Section 34 of the RBI Act and
shall cease to have the guarantee of the Central Government
under sub-section (1) of Section 26 of the said Act. It is
submitted that this is also clear from the affidavit dated 16th
November 2022 filed on behalf of the Union of India.
92. Shri Divan further submitted that the 2017 Act can
neither be construed to validate the impugned notification nor
can it be held that it is a piece of incorporation by reference. It
is submitted that the argument with regard to the impugned
notification having merged in the 2017 Act is also without
substance.    The learned Senior Counsel submits that it is
simply a plenary parliamentary declaration.
                                74
�93. Taking further his argument, Shri Divan submits that
clause (i) of sub-section (1) of Section 4 of the 2017 gives a
power to the Central Government which is coupled with a duty.
It   is   submitted   that     genuine    cases   like    that   of    the
applicants/petitioners       viz.,   Malvinder    Singh    and        Sarla
Vivek Narayan Sharma vs Union Of India on 2 January, 2023
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/164842744/
56
Shrivastav, who is the applicant/petitioner in I.A. No. 152009
of 2022, should be given some window to exchange the SBNs.
It is submitted that there is a large section of NRIs who, during
the period between 8th November 2016 and 30th December
2016, were not in India. It is submitted that they could have
also not travelled to India since either the tickets were not
available or the rates were prohibitively expensive.
94. Shri Divan, in the alternative, submitted that the proviso
to the Notification dated 30th December, 2016 has to be read in
a manner that it is silent on NRIs who have kept their money in
India. It is submitted that exclusion of NRIs who have left their
money in India would be manifestly arbitrary and in order to
save the proviso, it will have to be read in the manner making it
                                     75
�inapplicable to such NRIs who had kept their money in India
while residing abroad during that period.
VII. REFRAMED QUESTIONS
95. Though nine important questions have been framed by the
Bench of learned three Judges vide order dated 16th December
2016 in Writ Petition (Civil) No.906 of 2016, upon hearing the
submissions advanced before us on behalf of the petitioners as
well as the respondents, we find that only the following
questions of law arise for consideration. As such, the questions
are reframed as under:
     (i)   Whether    the    power     available   to   the   Central
           Government under sub-section (2) of Section 26 of
Vivek Narayan Sharma vs Union Of India on 2 January, 2023
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/164842744/
57
           the RBI Act can be restricted to mean that it can be
           exercised only for “one” or “some” series of bank
           notes and not “all” series in view of the word “any”
           appearing before the word “series” in the said sub-
           section,   specifically    so,   when   on   earlier   two
                                 76
�        occasions, the demonetization exercise was done
        through the plenary legislations?
(ii)    In the event it is held that the power under sub-
        section (2) of Section 26 of the RBI Act is construed
        to mean that it can be exercised in respect of “all”

              thereof to accept the demonetized notes beyond the
              period specified in notifications issued under sub-
              section (1) of Section 4?
VIII. STATUTORY SCHEME
96. Before we proceed to consider the various issues reframed
by us, we find it appropriate to refer to the scheme of the RBI
Act.
97. The preamble of the RBI Act would itself reveal that the
RBI Act was enacted since it was found expedient to constitute
a Reserve Bank of India to regulate the issue of Bank notes and
for the keeping of reserves with a view to securing monetary
                                   78
�stability in India and generally to operate the currency and
credit system of the country to its advantage. The preamble of
the RBI Act would also show that it was amended in the year
2016 with effect from 27th June 2016 by Act No. 28 of 2016.
Post amendment, it was stated in the preamble that, whereas it
was essential to have a modern monetary policy framework to
meet the challenge of an increasingly complex economy, and
whereas the primary objective of the monetary policy is to
Vivek Narayan Sharma vs Union Of India on 2 January, 2023
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/164842744/
59
maintain price stability while keeping in mind the objective of
growth and whereas the monetary policy framework in India
shall be operated by the RBI, the RBI Act was enacted.
98. Section 3 of the RBI Act would reveal that the RBI was
constituted for the purposes of taking over the management of
the currency from the Central Government and of carrying on
the business of banking in accordance with the provisions of
the RBI Act.
                              79
�99. Section 8 of the RBI Act deals with composition of the
Central Board and term of office of the Directors.      It will be
relevant to refer to sub-sections (1) and (5) of Section 8 of the
RBI, which read thus:
          “8. Composition of the Central Board,
          and term of office of Directors.-- (1)
          The Central Board shall consist of the
          following Directors, namely:-
          (a) a Governor and not more than four
                Deputy Governors to be appointed
                by the Central Government;
          (b)   four Directors to be nominated by
                the Central Government, one from
                each of the four Local Boards as
                constituted by section 9;
          (c)   ten Directors to be nominated by the
                Central Government; and
          (d)   two Government      officials to be
                nominated   by        the     Central
                Government.
                        xxx xxx xxx
                        xxx xxx xxx
          (5) No act or proceeding of the Board

60
          shall be questioned on the ground merely
                               80
�          of the existence of any vacancy in, or any
          defect in the constitution of, the Board.”
100. Section 17 of the RBI Act would reveal that the RBI has
been authorised to carry on and transact several kinds of
business specified therein.
101. Section 22 of the RBI Act would reveal that the RBI shall
have the sole right to issue bank notes in India and may, for a
period which shall be fixed by the Central Government on the
recommendation of the Central Board, issue currency notes of
the Government of India supplied to it by the Central
Government. It further provides that the provisions of the RBI
Act applicable to bank notes shall, unless a contrary intention
appears, apply to all currency notes of the Government of India
issued either by the Central Government or by the RBI in like
manner as if such currency notes were bank notes.            Sub-
section (2) of Section 22 of the RBI Act specifically provides that
on and from the date on which Chapter III of the RBI Act comes
                                81
�into force, the Central Government shall not issue any currency
notes.
102. Section 23 of the RBI Act would reveal that the issue of
bank notes shall be conducted by the RBI through an Issue
Department which shall be separated and kept wholly distinct
Vivek Narayan Sharma vs Union Of India on 2 January, 2023
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/164842744/
61
from the Banking Department, and the assets of the Issue
Department shall not be subject to any liability other than the
liabilities of the Issue Department as defined in Section 34.
Sub-section   (2)   of   Section    23   provides   that   the   Issue
Department shall not issue bank notes to the Banking
Department or to any other person except in exchange for other
bank notes or for such coin, bullion or securities as are
permitted by the RBI Act to form part of the Reserve.
103. Sub-section (1) of Section 24 of the RBI Act provides that,
subject to the provisions of sub-section (2), bank notes shall be
of the denominational values to two rupees, five rupees, ten
rupees, twenty rupees, fifty rupees, one hundred rupees, five
                                   82
�hundred rupees, one thousand rupees, five thousand rupees
and ten thousand rupees or of such other denominational
values, not exceeding ten thousand rupees as the Central
Government may, on the recommendation of the Central Board,
specify in this behalf. Sub-section (2) of Section 24 of the RBI
Act provides that the Central Government may, on the
recommendation of the Central Board, direct the non-issue or
the   discontinuance   of   issue   of   bank   notes     of   such
denominational values as it may specify in this behalf.
104. Section 25 of the RBI Act provides that the design, form
and the material of bank notes shall be such as may be
approved by the Central Government after consideration of the
Vivek Narayan Sharma vs Union Of India on 2 January, 2023

62
recommendations made by the Central Board.
105. Section 26 of the RBI is the provision which directly falls
for consideration. The same reads thus:
          “26. Legal tender character of notes.-
          (1) Subject to the provisions of sub-
          section (2), every bank note shall be legal
          tender at any place in India in payment,
                               83
�          or on account for the amount expressed
          therein, and shall be guaranteed by the
          Central Government.
          (2) On recommendation of the Central
          Board the Central Government may, by
          notification in the Gazette of India,
          declare that, with effect from such date
          as may be specified in the notification,
          any series of bank notes of any
          denomination shall cease to be legal
          tender save at such office or agency of the
          Bank and to such extent as may be
          specified in the notification.”
106. It can thus be seen that sub-section (1) of Section 26 of
the RBI Act provides that, subject to the provisions of sub-
section (2), every bank note shall be legal tender at any place in
India in payment, or on account for the amount expressed
therein, and shall be guaranteed by the Central Government.
Sub-section (2) of Section 26 of the RBI Act provides that on
recommendation of the Central Board, the Central Government
may, by notification in the Gazette of India, declare that, with
effect from such date as may be specified in the notification,
any series of bank notes of any denomination shall cease to be
                                84
Vivek Narayan Sharma vs Union Of India on 2 January, 2023
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/164842744/
63
�legal tender save at such office or agency of the Bank and to
such extent as may be specified in the notification.
107. Section 34 of the RBI Act provides that the liabilities of the
Issue Department of the RBI shall be an amount equal to the
total of the amount of the currency notes of the Government of
India and bank notes for the time being in circulation.
108. Perusal of the aforesaid provisions of the RBI Act would
reveal that insofar as monetary policy and specifically with
regard to the matters of management and regulation of
currency are concerned, the RBI plays a pivotal role.        As a
matter of fact, both the sides are ad idem on the said issue.
109. The importance of the role assigned to the RBI in such
matters would be amplified from the various judgments of this
Court, which we will refer to in the paragraphs to follow. In
this background, we will consider the issues that fall for our
consideration.
                                85
�ISSUE NO. (i) : WHETHER THE POWER AVAILABLE TO THE

THE PLENARY LEGISLATIONS?
110. It is strenuously urged by the learned Senior Counsel
appearing on behalf of the petitioners that the word “any” used
in sub-section (2) of Section 26 of the RBI Act will have to be
given a restricted meaning to mean “some”. It is submitted that
if sub-section (2) of Section 26 of the RBI Act is not read in
such manner, the very power available under the said sub-
section will have to be held to be invalid on the ground of
excessive delegation.   It is submitted that it cannot be
                              86
�construed that the legislature intended to bestow uncanalised,
unguided and arbitrary power to the Central Government to
demonetize the entire currency. It is, therefore, the submission
of the petitioners that in order to save the said Section from
being declared void, the word “any” requires to be interpreted in
a restricted manner to mean “some”.
111. Per contra, it is submitted on behalf of the respondents
that the word “any” under sub-section (2) of Section 26 of the
RBI Act, cannot be interpreted in a narrow manner and it will
have to be construed to include “all”.
Precedents construing the word “any”
112. A Constitution Bench of this Court in the case of The
Chief Inspector of Mines and another v. Lala Karam Chand
Thapar etc. (supra) was considering the question as to
whether the phrase “any one of the directors” as found in
Section 76 of the Mines Act, 1952 could mean “only one of the
Vivek Narayan Sharma vs Union Of India on 2 January, 2023
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/164842744/
65
directors” or could it be construed to mean “every one of the
directors”. In the said case, all the directors of the Company
                                87
�were prosecuted for the offences punishable under Sections 73
and 74 of the Mines Act, 1952. The High Court had held that
any ‘one’ of the directors of the Company could only be
prosecuted.   The Constitution Bench of this Court observed
thus:
               “It is quite clear and indeed not
         disputed that in some contexts, “any one”
         means “one only it matters not which
         one” the phrase “any of the directors” is
         therefore quite capable of meaning “only
         one of the directors, it does not matter
         which one”. Is the phrase however
         capable of no other meaning? If it is not,
         the courts cannot look further, and must
         interpret these words in that meaning
         only, irrespective of what the intention of
         the legislature might be believed to have
         been. If however the phrase is capable of
         another meaning, as suggested, viz.,
         “every one of the directors” it will be
         necessary to decide which of the two
         meanings      was     intended    by    the
         legislature.
               If one examines the use of the
         words      “any     one”    in    common
         conversation or literature, there can
         be no doubt that they are not
         infrequently used to mean “every one”
                              88
�— not one, but all. Thus we say of any
one can see that this is wrong, to
mean “everyone can see that this is
wrong”. “Any one may enter” does not
mean that “only one person may
enter”, but that all may enter. It is
permissible and indeed profitable to
turn in this connection to the Oxford
Vivek Narayan Sharma vs Union Of India on 2 January, 2023
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/164842744/
66
English Dictionary, at p. 378, of
which, we find the meaning of “any”
given thus: “In affirmative sentences,
it asserts, concerning a being or thing
of the sort named, without limitation
as to which, and thus collectively of
every one of them”. One of the
illustrations given is — “I challenge
anyone to contradict my assertions”.
Certainly, this does not mean that one
only is challenged; but that all are
challenged. It is abundantly clear
therefore that “any one” is not
infrequently used to mean “every one”.
      But, argues Mr Pathak, granting
that this is so, it must be held that when
the phrase “any one” is used with the
preposition “of”, followed by a word
denoting a number of persons, it never
means “every one”. The extract from
the Oxford Dictionary, it is interesting to
notice,    speaks     of    an    assertion
“concerning a being or thing of the sort
                     89
�named”; it is not unreasonable to say
that, the word “of” followed by a word
denoting a number of persons or things is
just such “naming of a sort” as
mentioned      there.    Suppose,     the
illustration “I challenge any one to
contradict my assertions” was changed to
“I challenge any one of my opponents to
contradict my assertion”. “Any one of my
opponents” here would mean “all my
opponents” — not one only of the
opponents.
      While the phrase “any one of them”
or any similar phrase consisting of “any
one”, followed by “of” which is followed in
its turn by words denoting a number of
persons or things, does not appear to
have fallen for judicial construction, in
our courts or in England — the phrase
“any of the present directors” had to be
interpreted in an old English case, Isle of
Wight      Railway     Co. v. Tahourdin [25
Chancery Division 320] . A number of
shareholders required the directors to call
Vivek Narayan Sharma vs Union Of India on 2 January, 2023
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/164842744/
67
a meeting of the company for two objects.
One of the objects was mentioned as “To
remove, if deemed necessary or expedient
any of the present directors, and to elect
directors to fill any vacancy on the
Board”. The directors issued a notice to
convene a meeting for the other object
                     90
�and held the meeting. Then the
shareholders, under the Companies
Clauses Act, 1845, issued a notice of
their own convening a meeting for both
the objects in the original requisition. In
an action by the directors to restrain the
requisitionists, from holding the meeting,
the Court of Appeal held that a notice to
remove “any of the present directors”
would justify a resolution for removing all
who are directors at the present time.
“Any”, Lord Cotton, L.J. pointed out,
would involve “all”.
     It is true that the language there
was “any of the present directors” and not
“any one of the present directors” and it
is urged that the word “one”, in the latter
phrase makes all the difference. We think
it will be wrong to put too much
emphasis on the word “one” here. It may
be pointed out in this connection that the
Permanent Edition of Words and Phrases,
mentions an American case Front &
Hintingdon       Building     &       Loan
Association v. Berzinski where the words
“any of them” were held to be the
equivalent of “any one of them”.
     After giving the matter full and
anxious consideration, we have come
to the conclusion that the words “any
                     91
�           one of the directors” is ambiguous; in
           some contexts, it means “only one of
           the directors, does not matter which
           one”, but in other contexts, it is
           capable of meaning “every one of the
           directors”. Which of these two
Vivek Narayan Sharma vs Union Of India on 2 January, 2023
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/164842744/
68
           meanings was intended by the
           legislature in any particular statutory
           phrase has to be decided by the courts
           on a consideration of the context in
           which the words appear, and in
           particular, the scheme and object of
           the legislation.”
                                [emphasis supplied]
113. The Constitution Bench found that the words “any one”
has been commonly used to mean “every one” i.e. not one, but
all.   It found that the word “any”, in affirmative sentences,
asserts, concerning a being or thing of the sort named, without
limitation. It held that it is abundantly clear that the word “any
one” is not infrequently used to mean “every one”.
114. It could be seen that the Constitution Bench, after giving
the matter full and anxious consideration, came to the
conclusion that the words “any one of the directors” was an
                                92
�ambiguous one. It held that in some contexts, it means “only
one of the directors, does not matter which one”, but in other
contexts, it is capable of meaning “every one of the directors”. It
held that which of these two meanings was intended by the
legislature in any particular statutory phrase has to be decided
by the courts on consideration of the context in which the
words appear, and in particular, the scheme and object of the
legislation.
115. After examining the scheme of the Mines Act, 1952, the
Constitution Bench of this Court further observed thus:
              “But, argues Mr Pathak, one must not
           forget the special rule of interpretation for
Vivek Narayan Sharma vs Union Of India on 2 January, 2023
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/164842744/
69
           “penal statute” that if the language is
           ambiguous, the interpretation in favour
           of the accused should ordinarily be
           adopted. If you interpret “any one” in the
           sense suggested by him, the legislation
           he suggests is void and so the accused
           escapes. One of the two possible
           constructions, thus being in favour of the
           accused, should therefore be adopted. In
           our opinion, there is no substance in this
           contention.    The      rule     of    strict
                                 93
�interpretation of penal statutes in
favour of the accused is not of
universal application, and must be
considered along with other well-
established rules of interpretation. We
have already seen that the scheme
and object of the statute makes it
reasonable     to   think      that   the
legislature intended to subject all the
directors of a company owning coal
mines to prosecution and penalties,
and not one only of the directors. In
the face of these considerations there
is no scope here of the application of
the rule for strict interpretation of
penal statutes in favour of the
accused.
   The High Court appears to have been
greatly impressed by the fact that in
other statutes where the legislature
wanted to make every one out of a group
or a class of persons liable it used clear
language expressing the intention; and
that the phrase “any one” has not been
used in any other statute in this country
to express “every one”. It will be
unreasonable, in our opinion, to
attach too much weight to this
circumstance; and as for the reasons
mentioned above, we think the phrase
“any one of the directors” is capable
of meaning “every one of the
                    94
�          directors”, the fact that in other
          statutes, different words were used to
Vivek Narayan Sharma vs Union Of India on 2 January, 2023
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/164842744/
70
          express a similar meaning is not of
          any significance.
             We     have,     on    all     these
          considerations come to the conclusion
          that the words “any one of the
          directors” has been used in Section 76
          to mean “every one of the directors”,
          and that the contrary interpretation
          given by the High Court is not
          correct.”
                               [emphasis supplied]
116. It could thus be seen that though it was sought to be
argued   before   the   Court   that   since   the   rule   of   strict
interpretation of penal statutes in favour of the accused has to
be adopted and that the word “any” was suffixed by the word
“one”, it has to be given restricted meaning; the Court came to
the conclusion that the words “any one of the directors” used in
Section 76 of the Mines Act, 1952 would mean “every one of the
directors”. It is further to be noted that the word “any” in the
said case was suffixed by the word “one”, still the Court held
that the words “any one” would mean “all” and not “one”. It is
                                95
�to be noted that in the present case, the legislature has not
employed the word “one” after the word “any”. It is settled law
that it has to be construed that every single word employed or
not employed by the legislature has a purpose behind it.
117. On the very date on which the judgment in the case of
The Chief Inspector of Mines and another v. Lala Karam
Chand Thapar etc. (supra) was pronounced, the same
Constitution Bench also pronounced the judgment in the case
of Banwarilal Agarawalla (supra), wherein the Constitution
Vivek Narayan Sharma vs Union Of India on 2 January, 2023

71
Bench observed thus:
             “The first contention is based on an
          assumption that the word “any one” in
Section 76 means only “one of the
          directors,   and    only   one    of  the
          shareholders”. This question as regards
          the interpretation of the word “any one”
          in Section 76 was raised in Criminal
          Appeals Nos. 98 to 106 of 1959 (Chief
          Inspector of Mines, etc.) and it has been
          decided there that the word “any one”
          should be interpreted there as “every
          one”. Thus under Section 76 every one
          of the shareholders of a private
          company owning the mine, and every
                              96
�         one of the directors of a public
         company owning the mine is liable to
         prosecution. No question of violation
         of Article 14 therefore arises.”
                               [emphasis supplied]
118. Another Constitution Bench of this Court in the case of
Tej Kiran Jain and others (supra) was considering the
provisions of Article 105 of the Constitution of India and,
particularly, the immunity as available to the Member of
Parliament “in respect of anything said…….. in Parliament”.
The Constitution Bench observed thus:
            “8. In our judgment it is not possible to
         read the provisions of the article in the
         way suggested. The article means what it
         says in language which could not be
         plainer. The article confers immunity
         inter alia in respect of “anything said ...
         in Parliament”. The word “anything” is
         of the widest import and is equivalent
         to “everything”. The only limitation
         arises from the words “in Parliament”
         which means during the sitting of
         Parliament and in the course of the

         business of Parliament. We are
         concerned only with speeches in Lok
         Sabha. Once it was proved that
         Parliament was sitting and its business
                              97
�          was being transacted, anything said
          during the course of that business was
          immune from proceedings in any Court
          this immunity is not only complete but is
          as it should be. It is of the essence of
          parliamentary system of Government that
          people's representatives should be free to
          express themselves without fear of legal
          consequences. What they say is only
          subject to the discipline of the rules of
          Parliament, the good sense of the
          members and the control of proceedings
          by the Speaker. The Courts have no say
          in the matter and should really have
          none.”
                                 [emphasis supplied]
119. This Court held that the word “anything” is of the widest
import and is equivalent to “everything”. The only limitation
arises from the words “in Parliament” which means during the
sitting of Parliament and in the course of the business of
Parliament. It held that, once it was proved that Parliament was
sitting and its business was being transacted, anything said
during the course of that business was immune from
proceedings in any Court.
                               98
a20. This Court, in the case of Lucknow Development
Authority (supra), was considering clause (o) of Section (2) of
the Consumer Protection Act, 1986 which defines “service”,
wherein the word “any” again fell for consideration. This Court
Vivek Narayan Sharma vs Union Of India on 2 January, 2023

73
observed thus:
             “4. …… The words ‘any’ and ‘potential’
          are significant. Both are of wide
          amplitude. The word ‘any’ dictionarily
          means ‘one or some or all’. In Black's Law
          Dictionary it is explained thus, “word
          ‘any’ has a diversity of meaning and may
          be employed to indicate ‘all’ or ‘every’ as
          well as ‘some’ or ‘one’ and its meaning in
          a given statute depends upon the context
          and the subject-matter of the statute”.
          The use of the word ‘any’ in the context it
          has been used in clause (o) indicates that
          it has been used in wider sense extending
          from one to all……”
121. This Court held that the word “any” is of wide amplitude.
It means “one or some or all”.       Referring to Black’s Law
Dictionary, the Court observed that the word “any” has a
diversity of meaning and may be employed to indicate “all” or
“every” as well as “some” or “one”. However, the meaning which
                               99
�is to be given to it would depend upon the context and the
subject-matter of the statute.
122. In the case of K.P. Mohammed Salim (supra), this Court
was considering the power of the Director General or Chief
Commissioner or Commissioner to transfer any case from one
or more assessing officers subordinate to him to any other
assessing officer or assessing officers.   This Court observed
thus:
         “17. The word “any” must be read in the
         context of the statute and for the said
         purpose, it may in a situation of this
         nature, means all. The principles of
         purposive construction for the said
Vivek Narayan Sharma vs Union Of India on 2 January, 2023

         purpose may be resorted to. (See New
         India Assurance Co. Ltd. v. Nusli Neville
         Wadia [(2008) 3 SCC 279 : (2007) 13 SCR
         598]) Thus, in the context of a statute,
         the word “any” may be read as all in
         the context of the Income Tax Act for
         which the power of transfer has been
         conferred    upon      the    authorities
         specified under Section 127.”
                               [emphasis supplied]
123. The Court again reiterated that the word “any” must be
read in the context of the statute. The Court also applied the
                                 100
�principles of purposive construction to the term “any” to mean
“all”.
124. In the case of Raj Kumar Shivhare (supra), an argument
was sought to be advanced that since Section 35 of the Foreign
Exchange Management Act, 1999 uses the words “any decision
or order”, only appeals from final order could be filed. Rejecting
the said contention, this Court observed thus:
          “19. The word “any” in this context would
          mean “all”. We are of this opinion in view
          of the fact that this section confers a right
          of appeal on any person aggrieved. A right
          of appeal, it is well settled, is a creature
          of statute. It is never an inherent right,
          like that of filing a suit. A right of filing a
          suit, unless it is barred by statute, as it is
          barred here under Section 34 of FEMA, is
          an inherent right (see Section 9 of the
          Civil Procedure Code) but a right of
          appeal is always conferred by a statute.
          While conferring such right a statute may
          impose restrictions, like limitation or pre-
          deposit of penalty or it may limit the area
          of appeal to questions of law or sometime
          to substantial questions of law. Whenever
          such limitations are imposed, they are to
          be strictly followed. But in a case where

75
                                101
�there is no limitation on the nature of
order or decision to be appealed against,
as in this case, the right of appeal cannot
be further curtailed by this Court on the
basis of an interpretative exercise.
20. Under Section 35 of FEMA, the
legislature has conferred a right of appeal
to a person aggrieved from “any” “order”
or “decision” of the Appellate Tribunal. Of
course such appeal will have to be on a
question of law. In this context the word
“any” would mean “all”.
        xxx        xxx        xxx
26. In the instant case also when a
right is conferred on a person
aggrieved to file appeal from “any”
order or decision of the Tribunal,
there is no reason, in the absence of a
contrary statutory intent, to give it a
restricted meaning. Therefore, in our
judgment in Section 35 of FEMA, any
“order” or “decision” of the Appellate
Tribunal would mean all decisions or
orders of the Appellate Tribunal and
all such decisions or orders are,
subject to limitation, appealable to
the High Court on a question of law.”
                     [emphasis supplied]
                    102
a25. While holding that the word “any” in the context would
mean “all”, this Court observed that a right of appeal is always
conferred by a statute. It has been held that, while conferring
such right, a statute may impose restrictions, like limitation or
pre-deposit of penalty or it may limit the area of appeal to
questions of law or sometime to substantial questions of law. It
has been held that whenever such limitations are imposed, they
are to be strictly followed. It has been held that in a case where
Vivek Narayan Sharma vs Union Of India on 2 January, 2023

76
there is no limitation, the right of appeal cannot be curtailed by
this Court on the basis of an interpretative exercise.
126. Shri P. Chidambaram, learned Senior Counsel relied on
the judgment of this Court in the case of Union of India v.
A.B. Shah and others (supra).        In the said case, the High
Court was considering an appeal preferred by the Union of
India wherein it had challenged the acquittal of the accused by
the learned trial court, which was confirmed in appeal by the
High Court. The learned trial court and the High Court had
                               103
�held that the complaint filed was beyond limitation. This Court
reversed the judgments of the learned trial court and the High
Court.   This Court while interpreting the expression “at any
time” observed thus:
          “12. If we look into Conditions 3 and 6
          with the object and purpose of the Act in
          mind, it has to be held that these
          conditions are not only relatable to what
          was required at the commencement of
          depillaring process, but the unstowing for
          the required length must exist always.
          The expression “at any time” finding
          place in Condition 6 has to mean, in
          the context in which it has been used,
          “at any point of time”, the effect of
          which is that the required length
          must be maintained all the time. The
          accomplishment of object of the Act, one
          of which is safety in the mines, requires
          taking of such a view, especially in the
          backdrop of repeated mine disasters
          which have been taking, off and on,
          heavy toll of lives of the miners. It may
          be pointed out that the word ‘any’ has
          a diversity of meaning and in Black's
          Law Dictionary it has been stated that
Vivek Narayan Sharma vs Union Of India on 2 January, 2023
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/164842744/
77
          this word may be employed to indicate
          ‘all’ or ‘every’, and its meaning will
          depend “upon the context and subject-
          matter of the statute”. A reference to
          what has been stated in Stroud's Judicial
                              104
�          Dictionary Vol. I, is revealing inasmuch as
          the import of the word ‘any’ has been
          explained from pp. 145 to 153 of the 4th
          Edn., a perusal of which shows it has
          different     connotations         depending
          primarily on the subject-matter of the
          statute and the context of its use. A
          Bench     of   this     Court     in Lucknow
          Development                 Authority v. M.K.
          Gupta [(1994) 1 SCC 243] , gave a very
          wide meaning to this word finding place
          in Section 2(o) of the Consumer
          Protection Act, 1986 defining ‘service’.
          (See para 4)”
                                   [emphasis supplied]
127. Shri Chidambaram rightly argued that the word “any” will
have to be construed in its context, taking into consideration
the scheme and the purpose of the enactment. There can be no
quarrel with regard to the said proposition.       Right from the
judgment of the Constitution Bench of this Court in the case of
The Chief Inspector of Mines and another v. Lala Karam
Chand Thapar etc. (supra), the position is clear. What is the
meaning which the legislature intended to give to a particular
statutory provision has to be decided by the Court on a
                               105
�consideration of the context in which the word(s) appear(s) and
in particular, the scheme and object of the legislation.
Purposive interpretation
Vivek Narayan Sharma vs Union Of India on 2 January, 2023
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/164842744/
78
128. We find that for deciding the present issue, it will also be
necessary to refer an important principle of interpretation of
statutes i.e. of purposive interpretation.
129. “Legislation has an aim, it seeks to obviate some mischief,
to supply an inadequacy, to effect a change of policy, to
formulate a plan of government. That aim, that policy is not
drawn, like nitrogen, out of the air; it is evidenced in the
language of the statute, as read in the light of other
external manifestations of purpose [Some Reflections on the
Reading of Statutes, 47 Columbia LR 527, at p. 538 (1947)].”
130. This is how Justice Frankfurter succinctly propounds the
principle of purposive interpretation.       It is thus necessary to
cull out the legislative policy from various factors like the words
in the statute, the preamble of the Act, the statement of objects
                                106
�and reasons, and in a given case, even the attendant
circumstances.        After the legislative policy is found, then the
words used in the statute must be so interpreted such that it
advances the purpose of the statute and does not defeat it.
131. Francis Bennion in his treatise Statutory Interpretation, at
page 810 described purposive construction in an equally
eloquent manner as under:
           “A purposive construction of an
        enactment is one which gives effect to the
        legislative purpose by—
               (a) following the literal meaning of the
           enactment where that meaning is in
           accordance with the legislative purpose
Vivek Narayan Sharma vs Union Of India on 2 January, 2023
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/164842744/
79
           (in this Code called a purposive-and-
           literal construction), or
               (b) applying a strained meaning where
           the literal meaning is not in accordance
           with the legislative purpose (in the Code
           called        a     purposive-and-strained
           construction).”
132. A statute must be construed having regard to the
legislative intent.     It has to be meaningful.     A construction
which leads to manifest absurdity must not be preferred to a
                                   107
�construction which would fulfil the object and purport of the
legislative intent.
133. Aharon Barak, the former President of the Supreme Court
of Israel, whose exposition of “doctrine of proportionality” has
found approval by the Constitution Bench of this Court in the
case of Modern Dental College and Research Centre and
Others (supra), to which we will refer to in the forthcoming
paragraphs, in his commentary on “Purposive Interpretation in
Law”, has summarized ‘the goal of interpretation in law’ as
under:
             “At some point, we need to find an
             Archimedean foothold, external to the
             text, from which to answer that
             question. My answer is this: The goal of
             interpretation in law is to achieve the
             objective – in other words, the purpose –
             of law.56     The role of a system of
             interpretation in law is to choose, from
             among the semantic options for a given
             text, the meaning that best achieves the
             purpose of the text. Each legal text –
             will, contract, statute, and constitution –
             was chosen to achieve a social objective.

Pub. Aff. 105, 125 (1988).
                                        108
�           Achieving this objective, achieving this
           purpose, is the goal of interpretation.
           The system of interpretation is the device
           and the means. It is a tool through
           which law achieves self-realization. In
           interpreting a given text, which is, after
           all, what interpretation in law does, a
           system of interpretation must guarantee
           that the purpose of the norm trapped in
           the – in our terminology, the purpose of
           the text – will be achieved in the best
           way. Hence the requirement that the
           system of interpretation be a rational
           activity. A coin toss will not do. This is
           also the rationale – which is at the core
           of my own views – for the belief that
           purposive interpretation is the most
           proper system of interpretation. This
           system is proper because it guarantees
           the achievement of the purpose of law.
           There      is    social,    jurisprudential,
           hermeneutical,        and     constitutional
           support for my claim that the proper
           criterion for interpretation is the search
           for law’s purpose, and that purposive
           interpretation best fulfills that criterion.
           A comparative look at the law supports
           it, as well. I will discuss each element of
           that support below.”
134. The    learned     Judge    emphasized      that     purposive
interpretation is the most proper system of interpretation. He
observed that this system is proper because it guarantees the
                                109
�achievement of the purpose of law.           The proper criterion for
interpretation is the search for law’s purpose, and that
purposive interpretation best fulfills that criterion.

135. The principle of purposive interpretation has also been
expounded through a catena of judgments of this Court.             A
Constitution Bench of this Court in the case of M. Pentiah and
others        v.   Muddala    Veeramallappa      and   others57   was
considering a question, as to whether the term prescribed in
Section 34 would apply to a member of a “deemed” committee
under the provisions of the Hyderabad District Municipalities
Act, 1956.         An argument was put forth that, upon a correct
interpretation of the provisions of Section 16, the same would
be permissible. Rejecting the said argument, K. Subba Rao, J,
observed thus:
                “Before we consider this argument in
                some detail, it will be convenient at this
                stage to notice some of the well
                established rules of Construction which
                would help us to steer clear of the
57
     (1961) 2 SCR 295
                                    110
�complications     created       by     the
Act. Maxwell on the Interpretation of
Statutes, 10th Edn., says at p. 7 thus:
   “… if the choice is between two
   interpretations, the narrower of
   which would fail to achieve the
   manifest      purpose      of    the
   legislation, we should avoid a
   construction which would reduce
   the legislation to futility and
   should rather accept the bolder
   construction based on the view
   that Parliament would legislate
   only for the purpose of bringing
   about an effective result”.
It is said in Craies on Statute Law, 5th

82
Edn., at p. 82—
   “Manifest absurdity or futility,
   palpable injustice, or absurd
   inconvenience or anomaly to be
   avoided.”
Lord Davey in Canada Sugar Refining
Co. v. R. [(1898)   AC    735]     provides
another      useful   guide     of   correct
perspective to such a problem in the
following words:
   “Every clause of a statute should
   be construed with reference to the
   context and the other clauses of
   the Act, so as, so far as possible,
   to make a consistent enactment of
   the whole statute or series of
                     111
�            statutes relating to the subject-
            matter.””
136. A.K. Sarkar, J. in his concurring opinion observed thus:
          “There is no doubt that the Act raises
          some difficulty. It was certainly not
          intended that the members elected to the
          Committee under the repealed Act
          should be given a permanent tenure of
          office nor that there would be no
          elections under the new Act. Yet such a
          result would appear to follow if the
          language used in the new Act is strictly
          and literally interpreted. It is however
          well established that “Where the
          language of a statute, in its ordinary
          meaning          and        grammatical
          construction, leads to a manifest
          contradiction      of    the    apparent
          purpose of the enactment, or to some
          inconvenience or absurdity, hardship
          or    in   justice,   presumably     not
          intended, a construction may be put
          upon it which modifies the meaning
          of the words, and even the structure
          of the sentence.…Where the main
          object and intention of a statute are
          clear, it must not be reduced to a

          Sense.”: see Maxwell on Statutes (10th
          Edn.) p. 229. In Seaford Court Estates
          Ltd. v. Asher [(1949) 2 AER 155, 164] ,
          Denning, L.J. said:
                “when a defect appears a judge
             cannot simply fold his hands and
             blame the draftsman. He must set
             to work on the constructive task
             of finding the intention of
             Parliament … and then he must
             supplement the written word so
             as to give “force and life” to the
             intention of the legislature …. A
             judge should ask himself the
             question how, if the makers of the
             Act had themselves come across
             this ruck in the texture of it, they
             would have straightened it out?
             He must then do as they would
             have done. A judge must not alter
             the material of which the Act is
             woven, but he can and should
             iron out the creases.””

138. In the case of M/s Girdhari Lal and Sons v. Balbir Nath
Mathur and others59, O. Chinnappa Reddy, J. explained the
position as under:
                “9. So we see that the primary and
                foremost task of a court in interpreting a
                statute is to ascertain the intention of
                the legislature, actual or imputed.
                Having ascertained the intention, the
                court must then strive to so interpret the
                statute as to promote or advance the
                object and purpose of the enactment.
                For this purpose, where necessary the

�          court may even depart from the rule that
          plain words should be interpreted
          according to their plain meaning. There
          need be no meek and mute submission
          to the plainness of the language. To
          avoid patent injustice, anomaly or
          absurdity or to avoid invalidation of a
          law, the court would be well justified in
          departing from the so-called golden rule
          of construction so as to give effect to the
          object and purpose of the enactment by
          supplementing the written word if
          necessary.”

jurisdictions, His Lordship observed thus:

          legislative intent is a basic rule of
          statutory construction and that a
          rule of construction should be
          preferred     which    advances    the
          purpose and object of a legislation
          and that though a construction,

140. M.N. Venkatachaliah, J. speaking for the Constitution
Bench of this Court in the case of Tinsukhia Electric Supply
Co. Ltd. v. State of Assam and others60 observed thus:
                “118. The courts strongly lean against
                any construction which tends to reduce
                a statute to futility. The provision of a
                statute must be so construed as to make
                it effective and operative, on the
                principle “ut res magis valeat quam
                pereat”. It is, no doubt, true that if a
                statute is absolutely vague and its
                language     wholly     intractable  and
                absolutely meaningless, the statute
                could be declared void for vagueness.
                This is not in judicial review by testing
                the     law     for    arbitrariness   or
                unreasonableness under Article 14; but

                with the language of a statute, does in

Co. v. Manchester Racecourse Co. [(1904)
2 Ch 352 : 16 TLR 429 : 83 LT 274]
Farwell J. said: (pp. 360-61)
      “Unless    the   words    were    so
   absolutely senseless that I could do
   nothing at all with them, I should be
   bound to find some meaning and not
   to declare them void for uncertainty.”

Denning approving the dictum of
Farwell, J., said:(All ER p. 516)
      “But when a Statute has some
   meaning, even though it is obscure, or
   several meanings, even though there
   is little to choose between them, the
   courts have to say what meaning the

   a nullity.”
120. It is, therefore, the court's duty to
make what it can of the statute, knowing
that the statutes are meant to be
operative and not inept and the nothing
short of impossibility should allow a

                   workable, and the interpretation
                   thereof by a court should be to secure
                   that object, unless crucial omission or
                   clear direction makes that end
                   unattainable.””

87
R.A. Mehta (Retired) and others61, this Court held as under:
                “98. The     doctrine     of    purposive
                construction may be taken recourse to
                for the purpose of giving full effect to
                statutory provisions, and the courts
                must state what meaning the statute
                should bear, rather than rendering the
                statute a nullity, as statutes are meant
                to be operative and not inept. The courts
                must refrain from declaring a statute to
                be    unworkable.      The    rules    of
                interpretation        require        that
                construction which carries forward
                the objectives of the statute, protects
                interest of the parties and keeps the
                remedy alive, should be preferred
                looking into the text and context of
                the statute. Construction given by the
                court must promote the object of the

     (2013) 13 SCC 1

�statute and serve the purpose for
which it has been enacted and not
efface its very purpose. “The courts
strongly lean against any construction
which tends to reduce a statute to
futility. The provision of the statute must
be so construed as to make it effective
and operative.” The court must take a
pragmatic view and must keep in
mind the purpose for which the
statute was enacted as the purpose
of law itself provides good guidance
to courts as they interpret the true
meaning of the Act and thus
legislative futility must be ruled out.
A statute must be construed in such a
manner so as to ensure that the Act
itself does not become a dead letter and
the obvious intention of the legislature
does not stand defeated unless it leads
to a case of absolute intractability in
use.     The    court    must     adopt    a
construction which suppresses the
mischief and advances the remedy and

“to suppress subtle inventions and
evasions for continuance of the mischief,
and pro privato commodo, and to add
force and life to the cure and remedy,
according to the true intent of the
makers of the Act, pro bono publico”. The
court must give effect to the purpose and
object of the Act for the reason that
legislature is presumed to have enacted
a      reasonable      statute.     (Vide M.

142. The   principle     of   purposive   construction     has   been
enunciated in various subsequent judgments of this Court.
However, we would not like to burden this judgment with a
plethora of citations. Suffice it to say, the law on the issue is
very well crystalized.
143. It is thus clear that it is a settled principle that the
modern approach of interpretation is a pragmatic one, and not
pedantic. An interpretation which advances the purpose of the
Act and which ensures its smooth and harmonious working
must be chosen and the other which leads to absurdity, or

�confusion, or friction, or contradiction and conflict between its
various provisions, or undermines, or tends to defeat or destroy
the basic scheme and purpose of the enactment must be
eschewed.       The primary and foremost task of the Court in
interpreting a statute is to gather the intention of the
legislature, actual or imputed.           Having ascertained the
intention, it is the duty of the Court to strive to so interpret the
statute as to promote or advance the object and purpose of the
enactment. For this purpose, where necessary, the Court may
even depart from the rule that plain words should be
interpreted according to their plain meaning. There need be no
meek and mute submission to the plainness of the language.
To avoid patent injustice, anomaly or absurdity or to avoid
invalidation of a law, the court would be justified in departing
from the so-called golden rule of construction so as to give
effect   to   the   object   and     purpose   of   the   enactment.
Ascertainment of legislative intent is the basic rule of statutory
construction.

144. Applying    the   aforesaid     pronouncements     on   the
construction of the term “any” and the principle of purposive
construction, we will now consider the scope of the term “any”
used in sub-section (2) of Section 26 of the RBI Act.
145. Sub-section (2) of Section 26 of the RBI Act empowers the
Vivek Narayan Sharma vs Union Of India on 2 January, 2023
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/164842744/
90
Central Government to issue a notification in the Gazette of
India thereby declaring that, with effect from such date as may
be specified in the notification, any series of bank notes of any
denomination shall cease to be legal tender. It further provides
that such an action has to be taken by the Central Government
on the recommendation of the Central Board.
146. As already discussed herein above, the RBI Act is a special
Act, vesting all the powers and functions with regard to
monetary policy and all matters pertaining to management and
regulation of currency with the RBI. The Central Government
                               122
�is   required   to   take   its   decision   on   the   basis   of   the
recommendation of the Central Board.
147. It could thus be seen that power is vested with the Central
Government and that power has to be exercised on the
recommendation of the RBI. Both sides agree that RBI plays a
unique role in the matter of monetary policy and issuance of
currency. The Central Government is empowered under sub-
section (2) of Section 26 of the RBI Act to notify any series of
bank notes of any denomination to cease to be a legal tender.
The effect of such a notification would be that the liabilities as
provided under Section 34 of the RBI Act and the guarantee as
provided under sub-section (1) of Section 26 of the RBI Act
shall cease to have effect on such notification being issued
thereby demonetizing the bank notes.
148. As already discussed herein above, the RBI Act has been
Vivek Narayan Sharma vs Union Of India on 2 January, 2023
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/164842744/
91
enacted to regulate the issue of bank notes and generally to
operate the currency and credit system of the country. Section
                                   123
c of the RBI Act provides that the RBI has been constituted for
the purposes of taking over the management of the currency
from the Central Government and carrying on the business of
banking in accordance with the provisions of the RBI Act. Sub-
section (1) of Section 22 of the RBI Act provides that the RBI
shall have the sole right to issue bank notes in India. However,
for a period which is to be fixed by the Central Government on
the recommendation of the Central Board, it can issue currency
notes of the Government of India supplied to it by the Central
Government. Further, sub-section (2) of Section 22 of the RBI
Act specifically prohibits the Central Government from issuing
any currency notes on and from the date on which Chapter III
of the RBI Act comes into effect.
149. It can thus clearly be seen that a primary and very
important role is assigned to the RBI in the matter of issuance
of bank notes.    As held by this Court in the case Peerless
General Finance and Investment Co. Limited and another
(supra), the RBI has a large contingent of expert advice
                               124
�available to it.   The Central Government would exercise its
power on the recommendation of the Central Board. When the
legislature itself has provided that the Central Government
Vivek Narayan Sharma vs Union Of India on 2 January, 2023
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/164842744/
92
would take a decision after considering the recommendation of
the Central Board of the RBI, which has been assigned a
primary role in matters with regard to monetary policy and
management and regulation of currency, we are of the view that
the legislature could not have intended to give a restricted
power under sub-section (2) of Section 26 of the RBI Act. In
any case, if the argument that the provisions of sub-section (2)
of Section 26 of the RBI Act have to be interpreted in a
restricted manner, is to be accepted, it may, at times, lead to an
anomalous situation.
150. For example, if there are 20 series of a particular
denomination, and if the argument of the petitioners is to be
accepted, the Central Government would be empowered to
demonetize 19 series of a particular denomination, leaving one
                               125
�series of the said denomination to continue to be a legal tender,
which would lead to a chaotic situation.
151. As discussed hereinabove, the policy underlining the
provisions of Section 26 of the RBI Act is to enable the Central
Government on the recommendation of the Central Board, to
effect demonetization. The same can be done in respect of any
series of bank notes of any denomination. The legislative policy
is with regard to management and regulation of currency.
Demonetization    of    notes   would   certainly   be   a   part   of
management and regulation of currency. The legislature has
Vivek Narayan Sharma vs Union Of India on 2 January, 2023
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/164842744/
93
empowered the Central Government to exercise such a power.
The Central Government may take recourse to such a power
when it finds necessary to do so taking into consideration
myriad factors.        No doubt that such factors must have
reasonable nexus with the object sought to be achieved. If the
Central Government finds that fake notes of a particular
denomination are widely in circulation or that they are being
used to promote terrorism, can it be said, for instance, that out
                                 126
�of 20 series of bank notes of a particular denomination, it can
demonetize only 19 series of bank notes but not all 20 series?
In our view, this will result in nothing else but absurdity and
the very purpose for which the power is vested shall stand
frustrated.   An interpretation which, in effect, nullifies the
purpose for which a power is to be exercised, in our view, would
be opposed to the principle of purposive interpretation. Such
an interpretation, in our view, rather than advancing the object
of the enactment, would defeat the same.
152. Another line of argument that is sought to be advanced
with regard to the submission that the power under sub-
section (2) of Section 26 of the RBI Act has to be construed to
restricting it to “one” or “some” series of bank notes, is that the
Parliament also meant the same inasmuch as on earlier two
occasions i.e. in 1946 and 1978 the demonetization exercise in
respect of “all” series was done by resorting to plenary

volumes of the history of the RBI. Perusal of Volume I thereof
                                127
�would reveal that, in 1946, it is not known when the
Government Authorities started thinking on the demonetization
measure, but the final consultation could take place with the
Governor and Deputy Governor.        It appears that the RBI
authorities were not enthusiastic about the scheme.          It
appears that in spite of the opposition by the then Governor of
the RBI, Shri C.D. Deshmukh, the Government went ahead
with the scheme and issued an ordinance on 12th January
1946.
153. Further, perusal of Volume III would reveal that the then
Governor I.G. Patel was not in favour of the demonetization
scheme of 1978.     However, in spite of the opposition of the
Governor of the RBI, the Government went ahead with the
demonetization scheme and issued an ordinance in the early
hours of 16th January 1978 and the news was announced on
All India Radio’s news bulletin at 9 am on the same day.
                              128
a54. It could thus be seen that on earlier two occasions, since
the RBI was not in favour of the demonetization, the
Government resorted to promulgating ordinances for the said
purpose.
155. It is to be noted that after the ordinance of 1946 was
promulgated, the RBI Act was amended vide Act No.62 of 1956

and Section 26A was added, thereby specifically providing that
no bank note of the denominational value of Rs.500/-, Rs.
1,000/- and Rs.10,000/- issued before the 13th day of January
1946 shall be legal tender in payment or on account for the
amount expressed therein.
156. After the ordinance was issued on 16th January 1978, the
same transformed into an Act of Parliament upon the President
of India giving his assent to the Act on 30th March 1978.
157. Merely because on earlier two occasions the Government
decided to take recourse to plenary power of legislation, this, by
itself, cannot be a ground to give a restricted meaning to the
                               129
�word “any” in sub-section (2) of Section 26 of the RBI Act. As
already discussed herein above, in our considered view, the
legislative intent could not have been to give a restricted
meaning to the word “any” in sub-section (2) of Section 26 of
the RBI Act.
158. We are, therefore, unable to accept the contention that the
word “any” has to be given a restricted meaning taking into
consideration the overall scheme, purpose and the object of the
RBI Act and also the context in which the power is to be
exercised. We find that the word “any” would mean “all” under
sub-section (2) of Section 26 of the RBI Act.
ISSUE NO. (ii): IN THE EVENT IT IS HELD THAT THE
POWER UNDER SUB-SECTION (2) OF SECTION 26 OF THE
Vivek Narayan Sharma vs Union Of India on 2 January, 2023

96
RBI ACT IS CONSTRUED TO MEAN THAT IT CAN BE
EXERCISED IN RESPECT OF “ALL” SERIES OF BANK
NOTES,    WHETHER       THE    POWER     VESTED    WITH    THE
CENTRAL GOVERNMENT UNDER THE SAID SUB-SECTION
                               130
�WOULD       AMOUNT        TO      CONFERRING         EXCESSIVE
DELEGATION AND AS SUCH, LIABLE TO BE STRUCK
DOWN?
159. The second limb of argument on behalf of the petitioners
is that, if the word “any” used in sub-section (2) of Section 26 of
the RBI Act is not given a restricted meaning, then sub-section
(2) of Section 26 of the RBI Act will have to be held invalid on
the ground that it confers excessive delegation upon the
Central Government.
160. It is submitted that sub-section (2) of Section 26 of the
RBI Act vests uncanalised, unguided and arbitrary powers in
the Central Government and as such, on this ground alone, the
said provision is liable to be struck down.
161. Shri P. Chidambaram, learned Senior Counsel has relied
on the Constitution Bench judgment of this Court in the case of
Hamdard Dawakhana (Wakf) Lal Kuan, Delhi and another

162. In the case of Hamdard Dawakhana (Wakf) Lal Kuan,

Delhi and another (supra), the Constitution Bench of this
Court while considering the validity of clause (d) of Section 3 of
the Drug and Magic Remedies (Objectionable Advertisement)
Act, (21 of 1954) observed thus:
          “33. The interdiction under the Act is
          applicable to conditions and diseases set
          out in the various clauses of Section 3
          and to those that may under the last part
          of clause (d) be specified in the Rules
          made under Section 16. The first sub-
          section of Section 16 authorises the
          making of rules to carry out the purposes
          of the Act and clause (a) of sub-section (2)
          of that section specifically authorises the
          specification of diseases or conditions to
          which the provisions of Section 3 shall
          apply. It is the first sub-section of Section
          16 which confers the general rule-making
          power      i.e.   it    delegates   to    the
          administrative authority the power to
          frame rules and regulations to subserve
          the object and purpose of the Act. Clause
          (a) of the second sub-section is merely
          illustrative of the power given under the
          first sub-section; King-Emperor v. Sibnath
                               132
�Banerji [(1945) LR 72 IA 241] . Therefore,
sub-section 2(a) also has the same object
as sub-section (1) i.e. to carry out the
purposes of the Act. Consequently, when
the rule-making authority specifies
conditions and diseases in the Schedule
it exercises the same delegated authority
as it does when it exercises powers under
sub-section (1) and makes other rules
and therefore it is delegated legislation.
The question for decision then is, is
the delegation constitutional in that
the administrative authority has been
supplied with proper guidance. In our
view the words impugned are vague.
Parliament      has     established    no
criteria, no standards and has not
prescribed any principle on which a
particular disease or condition is to
Vivek Narayan Sharma vs Union Of India on 2 January, 2023
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/164842744/
98
be specified in the Schedule. It is not
stated what facts or circumstances are to
be taken into consideration to include a
particular condition or disease. The
power of specifying diseases and
conditions as given in Section 3(d) must
therefore be held to be going beyond
permissible     boundaries      of   valid
delegation. As a consequence the
Schedule in the rules must be struck
down. But that would not affect such
conditions and diseases which properly
fall within the four clauses of Section 3
133
�          excluding the portion of clause (d) which
          has been declared to be unconstitutional.
          In the view we have taken it is
          unnecessary to consider the applicability
          of Baxter v. Ah Way [(1957) SCR 604].”
163. In the said case, this Court found that sub-section (1) of
Section 16 conferred a power on the Central Government to
make rules for carrying out the purposes of the Act. The Court
further found that, it is the first sub-section of Section 16
which confers the general rule-making power i.e. it delegates to
the administrative authority the power to frame rules and
regulations to subserve the object and purpose of the Act. The
Court found that the question, therefore, was, as to whether
the   delegation   to    the    administrative     authority   without
supplying proper guidance was constitutional or not.              The
Court   held   that     the   words     impugned   were   vague   and
Parliament had established no criteria, no standards and had
not prescribed any principle on which a particular disease or
condition was to be specified in the Schedule.            The Court,

99
                                  134
�therefore, held clause (d) of Section 3 to be amounting to
excessive delegation and as such unconstitutional.
164. In the case of Harakchand Ratanchand Banthia and
others (supra), the Constitution Bench of this Court was
considering the power given to the Administrator under the
Gold (Control) Act, 1968. Section 5 of the Gold (Control) Act,
1968, which confers power on the Administrator to issue
directions and orders, fell for consideration, which read thus:
          “5.    Power    of   Administrator     issue
          directions    and    orders.--     (1)   The
          Administrator may, if he thinks fit, make
          orders, not inconsistent with the
          provisions of this Act, for carrying out the
          provisions of this Act.
             (2) The Administrator may, so far as it
          appears to him to be necessary or
          expedient for carrying out the provisions
          of this Act, by order—
             (a) regulate, after consultation with
          the Reserve Bank of India, the price at
          which any gold may be bought or sold,
          and
             (b) regulate by licences, permits or
          otherwise, the manufacture, distribution,
          transport,      acquisition,     possession,
                               135
�             transfer, disposal, use or consumption of
             gold.”
                                    [emphasis supplied]
165. It can be seen that under clause (b) sub-section (2) of
Section 5 of the Gold (Control) Act, 1968, the Administrator was
conferred with the power to regulate by licences, permits or
otherwise,      the    manufacture,     distribution,     transport,
Vivek Narayan Sharma vs Union Of India on 2 January, 2023

acquisition, possession, transfer, disposal, use or consumption
of gold. In this premise, this Court observed thus:
             “20. It is manifest upon a review of all
             these    provisions    that  the   power
             conferred upon the Administrator
             under Section 5(2)(b) is legislative in
             character and extremely wide. A
             parallel     power      of    subordinate
             legislation is conferred to the Central
             Government under Section 114(1) and
             (2) of the Act. But Section 114(3)
             however makes it incumbent upon the
             Central Government to place the Rules
             before each House of Parliament while
             it is in session for a total period of
             thirty days which may be comprised
             in one session or in two successive
             sessions. It is clear that the substantive
             provisions of the Act namely Sections 8,
11, 21, 31(3), 34(3) confer powers on the
                                 136
�          Administrator     similar   to     those
          contemplated by Section 5(2)(b) of the
          Act. In these circumstances we are of
          opinion that the power of regulation
          granted to the Administrator under
Section 5(2)(b) of the Act suffers from
          excessive delegation of legislative
          power and must be held to be
          constitutionally invalid.”
                                [emphasis supplied]
166. This Court in the case of Harakchand Ratanchand
Banthia and others (supra), therefore, was considering the
delegation of power to the Administrator under clause (b) of
sub-section (2) of Section 5 of the Gold (Control) Act, 1968. The
Court found that a parallel power of subordinate legislation was
conferred to the Central Government under Section 114(1) and
(2) of the said Act. However, under sub-section (3) of Section
114 of the said Act it is incumbent upon the Central
Vivek Narayan Sharma vs Union Of India on 2 January, 2023
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/164842744/
101
Government    to   place   the   Rules   before   each   House   of
Parliament.   This Court further held that the substantive
provisions of the Act namely Sections 8, 11, 21, 31(3) and 34(3)
of the said Act also confer powers on the Administrator which
                                 137
�was similar to the one contemplated by Section 5(2)(b) of the
said Act.   In these circumstances, the Court held that the
power of regulation granted to the Administrator under Section
5(2)(b) of the said Act suffers from excessive delegation and as
such unconstitutional.
167. It could thus be seen that clause (b) of sub-section (2) of
Section 5 of the Gold (Control) Act, 1968 conferred a power on
the Administrator which was legislative in nature, to regulate
the transactions with regard to use and consumption of gold.
168. It is to be noted that clause (a) of sub-section (2) of Section
5 of the Gold (Control) Act, 1968 also empowered the
Administrator to regulate, after consultation with the RBI,
the price at which any gold may be bought or sold. It was also
argued before the Court that the said provision is also invalid
amounting to excessive delegation inasmuch as the power
conferred was unguided.      This Court specifically rejected the
                                138
�said contention.   It will be apposite to refer to the following
observations of this Court:
          “..…As the power to fix the price may
Vivek Narayan Sharma vs Union Of India on 2 January, 2023
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/164842744/
102
          also be exercised not only in respect of
          primary gold but also in respect of
          articles and ornaments the business of
          the petitioners and similarly other
          persons will be adversely affected. But
          the section provides the safeguard
          that the regulation of the price
          should be made by the Administrator
          after consultation with the Reserve
          Bank of India. It was argued that the
          phrase “so far as it appears to him to be
          necessary or expedient for carrying out
          the provisions of this Act” was a
          subjective formula and action of the
          Administrator in making the orders
          under Section 5 (2)(a) may be arbitrary
          and unreasonable. But in our opinion
          the formula is not subjective and does
          not constitute the Administrator the sole
          judge as to what is in fact necessary or
          expedient for the purposes of the Act. On
          the contrary we hold that in the context
          of the scheme and object of the
          legislation as a whole the expression
          cannot be construed in a subjective
          sense     and   the    opinion    of   the
          Administrator as to the necessity or
          expediency of making the order must be
          reached objectively after having regard to
          the relevant considerations and must be
                              139
�          reasonably tenable in a court of law. It
          must be assumed that the Administrator
          will generally address himself to the
          circumstances of the situation before
          him and not try to promote purposes
          alien to the object of the Act….”
                                  [emphasis supplied]
169. It is thus clear that though the Court found the power
under Section 5(2)(b) of the Gold (Control) Act, 1968 suffered
from   excessive   delegation   and,   therefore,   constitutionally
invalid; it, however, categorically rejected the contention insofar
as Section 5(2)(a) of the Gold (Control) Act, 1968 is concerned,
inasmuch as it provided a safeguard that the regulation of the
Vivek Narayan Sharma vs Union Of India on 2 January, 2023
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/164842744/
103
price should be made by the Administrator after consultation
with the RBI.
170. This Court rejected the argument that the phrase “so far
as it appears to him to be necessary or expedient for carrying
out the provisions of this Act” was a subjective formula and as
such, the action of the Administrator under Section 5(2)(a) was
arbitrary and unreasonable. Rejecting the said contention, the
                                140
�Court held that in the context of the scheme and object of the
legislation as a whole, the expression cannot be construed in a
subjective sense and the opinion of the Administrator as to the
necessity or expediency of making the order must be reached
objectively after having regard to the relevant considerations
and must be reasonably tenable in a court of law.
171. It could thus be seen that though the Court found the
power under Section 5(2)(b) of the Gold (Control) Act, 1968 to
be invalid on the ground of excessive delegation, yet it found
the power under Section 5(2)(a) of the Gold (Control) Act, 1968
to be valid since it provides an inbuilt safeguard that the
Administrator has to act after consultation with the RBI.
172. A Seven-Judge Bench of this Court in the case of Birla
Cotton, Spinning and Weaving Mills Delhi (supra) was
considering the validity of Section 150 of the Delhi Municipal
Corporation Act, 1957, which reads thus:
Vivek Narayan Sharma vs Union Of India on 2 January, 2023
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/164842744/
104
                              141
�“150. Imposition of other taxes.
(1) The Corporation may, at a meeting,
pass a resolution for the levy of any of
the taxes specified in sub-section (2) of
Section 113, defining the maximum rate
of the tax to be levied, the class or
classes of persons or the description or
descriptions of articles and properties to
be taxed, the system of assessment to be
adopted and the exemptions, if any, to
be granted.
(2) Any resolution passed under sub-
section (1) shall be submitted to the
Central Government for its sanction, and
if sanctioned by that Government, shall
come into force on and from such date
as may be specified in the order of
sanction.
(3) After a resolution has come into force
under sub-section (2), the Corporation
may, subject to the maximum rate, pass
a second resolution determining the
actual rates at which the tax shall be
leviable; and the tax shall come into
force on the first day of the quarter of the
year next following the date on which
such second resolution is passed.
(4) After a tax has been levied in
accordance with the foregoing provisions
of this section, the provisions of sub-
                     142
�            section (2) of Section 109, shall apply in
            relation to such tax as they apply in
            relation to any tax imposed under sub-
            section (1) of Section 113.”
173. It was sought to be argued that Section 150(1) delegates
completely unguided power to the Corporation in the matter of
optional taxes and suffers from the vice of excessive delegation
and, therefore, is unconstitutional.

174. This    Court   after   considering   various   earlier   cases
including Hamdard Dawakhana (Wakf) Lal Kuan, Delhi
and another (supra) observed thus:
                  “A review of these authorities
            therefore leads to the conclusion that so
            far as this Court is concerned the
            principle is well established that
            essential legislative function consists of
            the determination of the legislative policy
            and its formulation as a binding rule of
            conduct and cannot be delegated by the
            legislature. Nor is there any unlimited
            right of delegation inherent in the
            legislative power itself. This is not
            warranted by the provisions of the
            Constitution. The legislature must retain
            in its own hands the essential legislative
                                 143
�functions and what can be delegated is
the task of subordinate legislation
necessary for implementing the purposes
and objects of the Act. Where the
legislative policy is enunciated with
sufficient clearness or a standard is laid
down, the courts should not interfere.
What guidance should be given and
to what extent and whether guidance
has been given in a particular case at
all depends on a consideration of the
provisions of the particular Act with
which the Court has to deal including
its preamble. Further it appears to us
that the nature of the body to which
delegation is made is also a factor to
be taken into consideration in
determining       whether     there     is
sufficient guidance in the matter of
delegation.
     What form the guidance should
take is again a matter which cannot
be stated in general terms. It will
depend upon the circumstances of
each statute under consideration; in
some cases guidance in broad
general terms may be enough; in
other cases more detailed guidance

a75. K.N. Wanchoo, CJ, speaking for himself and J.M. Shelat,
J. held that where the legislative policy is enunciated with
sufficient clarity or a standard is laid down, the courts should
not interfere. What guidance should be given and to what
extent and whether guidance has been given in a particular
case at all depends on a consideration of the provisions of the
particular Act with which the Court has to deal, including its
preamble.   They further held that the nature of the body to

guidance in the matter of delegation. The Court further held
that what form the guidance should take is again a matter

the circumstances of each statute under consideration.        It
further held that in some cases guidance in broad general

          years. This means that if they have
          behaved     unreasonably    and    the
          inhabitants of the area so consider it
          they can be thrown out at the ensuing
          elections. This is in our opinion a
          great check on the elected councillors
          acting    unreasonably   and    fixing
          unreasonable rates of taxation. This
          is a democratic method of bringing to
          book the elected representatives who
          act unreasonably in such matters….”
                              [emphasis supplied]
177. It was thus found that the delegation was made to an
elected body responsible to the people including those who pay
taxes. It has been observed that if the councillors behave
unreasonably and the inhabitants of the area so consider it,
they can be thrown out at the ensuing elections. As such, there
is a great check on the elected councillors acting unreasonably
and fixing unreasonable rates of taxation. This is a democratic
                              146
�method of bringing to book the elected representatives who act
unreasonably in such matters.
178. The Court further found that another guide or control on
the limit of taxation is to be found in the purposes of the Act.
After careful consideration of the various provisions of the Delhi
Municipal Corporation Act, 1957, the Court held that the power
conferred by Section 150 thereof on the Corporation is not
unguided and cannot be said to be amounting to excessive
delegation.
179. It will also be apposite to refer to the concurring judgment
of S.M. Sikri, J., wherein he observed thus:

          “But assuming I am bound by
          authorities of this Court to rest the
          validity of Section 113(2)(d) and Section
          150 of the Act by ascertaining whether a
          guide or policy exists in the Act, I find
          adequate guide or policy in the
          expression “purposes of the Act” in
Section 113. The Act has pointed out
          the objectives or the results to be
          achieved and taxation can be levied
          only for the purpose of achieving the
          objectives or the results. This, in my
                               147
�            view, is sufficient guidance especially to
            a self-governing body like the Delhi
            Municipal     Corporation.   It   is   not
            necessary to rely on the safeguards
            mentioned by the learned Chief Justice
            to sustain the delegation.”
                                   [emphasis supplied]
180. S.M. Sikri, J. in his concurring judgment also held that he
found adequate guide or policy in the expression “purposes of
the Act” in Section 113. He observed that the Act has pointed
out the objectives or the results to be achieved and taxation can
be levied only for the purpose of achieving the objectives or the
results. In the view of His Lordship, this was sufficient
guidance especially to a self-governing body like the Delhi
Municipal Corporation.
181. It   will   also    be    apposite    to   refer        to    the    following
observations     of     M.    Hidayatullah,     J.,     in        his    concurring
judgment:
               “…..The question always is whether

          merely left the execution of it to a
          chosen instrumentality (provided that
          it has not parted with its control)
          there can be no question of excessive
          delegation. If the delegate acts
          contrary to the wishes of the
          legislature the legislature can undo
          what the delegate has done. Even the
          courts, as we shall show presently, may
          be asked to intervene when the delegate
          exceeds its powers and functions…..”
             “To insist that the legislature should
          provide for every matter connected with
          municipal      taxation    would     make
          municipalities    mere    tax    collecting
          departments of the Government and not
          self-governing bodies which they are
          intended to be. The Government might
          as well collect the taxes and make them
          available to the municipalities. That is
          not a correct reading of the history of
          Municipal Corporations and other self-
          governing institutions in our country.”
                                 [emphasis supplied]
182. Observing thus, M. Hidayatullah, J. also rejected the
contention that provisions of Section 150 suffer from excessive
delegation.   His Lordship has observed that once it is
established that the legislature itself has willed that a
                               149
�particular thing be done and has merely left the execution of it
to a chosen instrumentality, there can be no question of
excessive delegation.   This is, however, subject to the proviso
that the legislature has not parted with its control.       It is
observed that if the delegatee acts contrary to the wishes of the
legislature the legislature can undo what the delegate has done.

183. Another Constitution Bench of this Court in the case of
Gwalior Rayon Silk Mfg. (Wvg.) Co. Ltd. (supra) was
considering the validity of Section 8(2)(b) of the Central Sales
Tax Act, 1956 on the ground that it suffered from the vice of
excessive delegation.    In the said case, H.R. Khanna, J.,
speaking for the majority, after surveying the earlier judgments
of this Court including that in the case of Birla Cotton,
Spinning and Weaving Mills Delhi (supra), observed thus:
          “13. It may be stated at the outset that
          the growth of the legislative powers of
          the     Executive    is    a   significant
          development of the twentieth century.
          The theory of laissezfaire has been given
          a go-by and large and comprehensive
          powers are being assumed by the State
                               150
�with a view to improve social and
economic well-being of the people. Most
of    the     modern      socio-economic
legislations passed by the Legislature
lay down the guiding principles and
the      legislative     policy.        The
Legislatures because of limitation
imposed upon by the time factor
hardly go into matters of detail.
Provision is, therefore, made for
delegated     legislation     to    obtain
flexibility, elasticity, expedition and
opportunity for experimentation. The
practice of empowering the Executive to
make subordinate legislation within a
prescribed sphere has evolved out of
practical necessity and pragmatic needs
of a modern welfare State. At the same
time it has to be borne in mind that
our       Constitution-makers         have
entrusted the power of legislation to
the representatives of the people, so
that the said power may be exercised
not only in the name of the people but
also by the people speaking through

their representatives. The role against
excessive    delegation    of    legislative
authority flows from and is a necessary
postulate of the sovereignty of the
people. The rule contemplates that it is
not permissible to substitute in the
matter of legislative policy the views of
individual officers or other authorities,
however competent they may be, for that
                     151
�          of the popular will as expressed by the
          representatives of the people.”
                                 [emphasis supplied]
184. The Court observed that the growth of the legislative
powers of the Executive is a significant development of the
twentieth century. The theory of laissez faire has been given a
go-by and large and comprehensive powers are being assumed
by the State with a view to improve social and economic well-
being of the people. It has been held that most of the modern
socio-economic legislations passed by the Legislature lay down
the guiding principles and the legislative policy. It is not
possible for the Legislatures to go into matters of detail.
Therefore, a provision has been made for delegated legislation
to obtain flexibility, elasticity, expedition and opportunity for
experimentation. It has been held that the practice of
empowering the Executive to make subordinate legislation
within a prescribed sphere has evolved out of practical
necessity and pragmatic needs of a modern welfare State. It has
been observed that the role against excessive delegation of

�legislative authority flows from and is a necessary postulate of
the sovereignty of the people. It has been held that the rule
contemplates that it is not permissible to substitute in the
matter of legislative policy the views of individual officers or
other authorities, however competent they may be, for that of
the popular will as expressed by the representatives of the
people.
185. It has further been observed thus:
          “15. The Constitution, as observed by
          this Court in the case of Devi Das Gopal
          Krishnan v. State of Punjab [AIR 1967 SC
          1895 : (1967) 3 SCJ 557 : (1967) 20 STC
          430] confers a power and imposes a duty
          on the Legislature to make laws. The
          essential legislative function is the
          determination      of   the    legislative
          policy and its formulation as a rule
          of conduct. Obviously it cannot
          abdicate its functions in favour of
          another.    But     in   view    of   the
          multifarious activities of a welfare
          State, it cannot presumably work out
          all the details to suit the varying
          aspects of a complex situation. It
          must     necessarily     delegate     the
          working out of details to the
          Executive or any other agency. But
                              153
�          there is danger inherent in such a
          process of delegation. An over-burdened
          Legislature or one controlled by a
          powerful Executive may unduly overstep
          the limits of delegation. It may not lay
          down any policy at all; it may declare
          its policy in vague and general terms;
          it may not set down any standard for
          the guidance of the Executive; it may
          confer an arbitrary power on the
          Executive to change or modify the
          policy laid down by it without
          reserving for itself any control over
          subordinate legislation. This self-

          of another agency either in whole or in
          part is beyond the permissible limits of
          delegation. It is for a court to hold on
          a    fair,    generous      and    liberal
          construction of an impugned statute
          whether the Legislature exceeded
          such limits.”
                                 [emphasis supplied]
186. It has been held that the essential legislative function is
the determination of the legislative policy and its formulation as
a rule of conduct. The Legislature cannot abdicate its functions
in favour of another.    However, in view of the multifarious
activities of a welfare State, it cannot presumably work out all
                               154
�the details to suit the varying aspects of a complex situation. It
must, therefore, necessarily delegate the working out of details
to the Executive or any other agency. The Court also cautions
about the danger inherent in the process of delegation.         It
observed that an over-burdened Legislature or one controlled
by a powerful Executive may unduly overstep the limits of
delegation. It may not lay down any policy at all; it may declare
its policy in vague and general terms; it may not set down any
standard for the guidance of the Executive; it may confer an
arbitrary power on the Executive to change or modify the policy
laid down by it without reserving for itself any control over
subordinate legislation. It has been held that it is for the Court
to hold on a fair, generous and liberal construction of an
impugned statute to examine whether the Legislature exceeded
Vivek Narayan Sharma vs Union Of India on 2 January, 2023

114
such limits.
187. We may gainfully refer to the following observations in the
concurring judgment of K.K. Mathew, J.:
                               155
�“57. Delegation of “law-making” power, it
has been said, is the dynamo of modern
Government.       Delegation      by    the
Legislature is necessary in order that the
exertion of legislative power does not
become a futility. Today, while theory
still affirms legislative supremacy,
we     see     power       flowing    back
increasingly       to    the     Executive.
Departure      from      the    traditional
rationalization of the status quo
arouses distrust. The Legislature
comprises a broader cross-section of
interests than any one administrative
organ; it is less likely to be captured by
particular interests. We must not,
therefore, lightly say that there can
be a transfer of legislative power
under the guise of delegation which
would tantamount to abdication. At
the same time, we must be aware of
the practical reality, and that is,
that Parliament cannot go into the
details of all legislative matters. The
doctrine of abdication expresses a
fundamental democratic concept but at
the same time we should not insist that
law-making as such is the exclusive
province of the Legislature. The aim of
Government is to gain acceptance for
objectives demonstrated as desirable and
to realise them as fully as possible. The
making of law is only a means to achieve
a purpose. It is not an end in itself. That
end can be attained by the Legislature
                     156
�making the law. But many topics or
subjects of legislation are such that
they require expertise, technical
knowledge       and     a    degree      of
Vivek Narayan Sharma vs Union Of India on 2 January, 2023
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/164842744/
115
adaptability to changing situations
which Parliament might not possess
and, therefore, this end is better
secured by extensive delegation of
legislative power. The legislative
process would frequently bog down if
a Legislature were required to
appraise beforehand the myriad
situations to which it wishes a
particular policy to be applied and to
formulate specific rules for each
situation. The presence of Henry VIII
clause in many of the statutes is a
pointer to the necessity of extensive
delegation. The hunt by Court for
legislative policy or guidance in the
crevices of a statute or the nook and
cranny of its preamble is not an
edifying spectacle. It is not clear what
difference does it make in principle by
saying that since the delegation is to a
representative body, that would be a
guarantee that the delegate will not
exercise the power unreasonably, for, if
ex hypothesi the Legislature must
perform the essential legislative function,
it is certainly no consolation that the
body to which the function has been
delegated has a representative character.
In other words, if, no guidance is
provided or policy laid down, the fact
                     157
�          that     the     delegate     has     a
          representative character could make
          no difference in principle.”
                               [emphasis supplied]
188. Though the learned Judge cautions against abdication
under the guise of delegation, he also emphasizes a necessity to
be aware about the practical reality, i.e. Parliament cannot go
into the details of all legislative matters.   The learned Judge
observed that the aim of Government is to gain acceptance for
objectives demonstrated as desirable and to realise them as
fully as possible. The learned Judge observed that there are
Vivek Narayan Sharma vs Union Of India on 2 January, 2023
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/164842744/
116
many topics or subjects of legislation which are such that they
may require expertise, technical knowledge and a degree of
adaptability to changing situations which Parliament might not
possess and, therefore, this end is better secured by extensive
delegation of legislative power. It has been held that the
legislative process would frequently bog down if a Legislature
were required to appraise beforehand the myriad situations to
which it wishes a particular policy to be applied and to
                               158
�formulate specific rules for each situation. The Court further
emphasized for a guidance for the delegate to exercise the
delegated power.
189. This Court, in the case of The Registrar of Co-operative
Societies, Trivandrum and another v. K. Kunjabmu and
others (supra), while reversing the judgment of the Kerala High
Court, which had held Section 60 of the Madras Co-operative
Societies Act, 1932 to be unconstitutional on the ground of vice
of excessive delegation, observed thus:
          “3. ….Executive activity in the field of
          delegated or subordinate legislation
          has increased in direct, geometric
          progression. It has to be and it is as
          it should be. Parliament and the
          State Legislatures are not bodies of
          experts or specialists. They are skilled
          in the art of discovering the aspirations,
          the expectations and the needs, the
          limits to the patience and the
          acquiescence and the articulation of the
          views of the people whom they represent.
          They function best when they concern
          themselves with general principles,
Vivek Narayan Sharma vs Union Of India on 2 January, 2023
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/164842744/
117
          broad objectives and fundamental
          issues instead of technical and
                               159
�situational intricacies which are
better left to better equipped full time
expert executive bodies and specialist
public servants. Parliament and the
State Legislatures have neither the time
nor the expertise to be involved in detail
and circumstance. Nor can Parliament
and the State Legislatures visualise
and provide for new, strange,
unforeseen        and       unpredictable
situations       arising     from      the
complexity of modern life and the
ingenuity of modern man. That is the
raison d'etre for delegated legislation.
That is what makes delegated legislation
inevitable and indispensable. The Indian
Parliament and the State Legislatures
are endowed with plenary power to
legislate upon any of the subjects
entrusted to them by the Constitution,
subject to the limitations imposed by the
Constitution itself. The power to legislate
carries with it the power to delegate. But
excessive delegation may amount to
abdication. Delegation unlimited may
invite despotism uninhibited. So the
theory has been evolved that the
legislature cannot delegate its essential
legislative function. Legislate it must
by laying down policy and principle
and delegate it may to fill in detail
and carry out policy. The legislature
may guide the delegate by speaking
through      the     express    provision
empowering delegation or the other
                     160
�           provisions     of    the     statute,    the
           preamble, the scheme or even the very
           subject-matter of the statute. If
           guidance there is, wherever it may be
           found, the delegation is valid. A good
           deal of latitude has been held to be
           permissible in the case of taxing statutes
Vivek Narayan Sharma vs Union Of India on 2 January, 2023
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/164842744/
118
           and on the same principle a generous
           degree of latitude must be permissible in
           the    case     of   welfare     legislation,
           particularly those statutes which are
           designed to further the Directive
           Principles of State Policy.”
                                  [emphasis supplied]
190. This Court has observed that the executive activity in the
field of delegated or subordinate legislation has increased in
direct,   geometric   progression.     The   Court   observed   that
Parliament and the State Legislatures are not bodies of experts
or specialists. It is observed that the legislative bodies function
best when they concern themselves with general principles,
broad objectives and fundamental issues instead of technical
and situational intricacies which are better left to better
equipped full time expert executive bodies and specialist public
servants. It has been held that Parliament and the State
                                 161
�Legislatures cannot visualize and provide for new, strange,
unforeseen and unpredictable situations arising from the
complexity of modern life and the ingenuity of modern man. It
has been further reiterated that guidance could be found from
various factors and once it is found, the delegation is valid.   It
has been held that a good deal of latitude has to be held to be
permissible in the case of taxing statutes and welfare
legislations.
191. This Court in the case of Ramesh Birch and others
(supra) again, after referring to the earlier judgments and after
considering the views expressed by various learned Judges on
Vivek Narayan Sharma vs Union Of India on 2 January, 2023
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/164842744/
119
the aspect of delegated legislation, observed thus:
           “23. But, these niceties apart, we think
           that Section 87 is quite valid even on the
           “policy and guideline” theory if one has
           proper regard to the context of the Act
           and the object and purpose sought to be
           achieved by Section 87 of the Act. The
           judicial decisions referred to above make
           it clear that it is not necessary that the
           legislature should “dot all the i's and
           cross all the t's” of its policy. It is
           sufficient if it gives the broadest
                               162
�          indication of a general policy of the
          legislature…...”
192. Recently, the Constitution Bench of this Court in the case
of Rojer Mathew (supra) considered the question, as to
whether Section 184 of the Finance Act, 2017, which does not
prescribe qualifications, appointment, term and conditions of
service, salary and allowances, etc. suffers from the vice of
excessive delegation.   Rejecting the contention, this Court
observed thus:
          “145. Cautioning against the potential
          misuse of Section 184 by the executive,
          it was vehemently argued by the learned
          counsel for the petitioner(s) that any
          desecration by the executive of such
          powers threatens and poses a risk to the
          independence of the tribunals. A mere
          possibility or eventuality of abuse of
          delegated powers in the absence of any
          evidence supporting such claim, cannot
          be a ground for striking down the
          provisions of the Finance Act, 2017. It is
          always open to a constitutional court on
          challenge made to the delegated
          legislation framed by the executive to
          examine whether it conforms to the
          parent legislation and other laws, and

�           apply the “policy and guideline” test and
           if found contrary, can be struck down
           without affecting the constitutionality of
           the rule-making power conferred under
Section 186 of the Finance Act, 2017.”
193. It can thus be seen that this Court has held that a mere
possibility or eventuality of abuse of delegated powers in the
absence of any evidence supporting such claim, cannot be a
ground for striking down such a provision. It has been held
that if a challenge is made to the delegated legislation framed
by   the   executive,   the   same    can   be   examined   by   the
constitutional court.   It has been held that applying the “policy
and guideline” test, if it is found that the delegated legislation
does not satisfy the said test, the legislation can be struck
down without affecting the constitutionality of the rule-making
power conferred under Section 186 of the Finance Act, 2017.
                                164
�Status of the RBI
194. Having adverted to the various judgments on the issue of
delegated legislation, we find it necessary to refer to certain
judgments of this Court outlining the status of the RBI.
195. The Constitution Bench of this Court in the case of
Joseph Kuruvilla Velukunnel (supra) was considering a
challenge to Section 38(1) and (3)(b)(iii) of the Banking
Companies Act, 1949 being violative of Articles 14, 19 and 301
Vivek Narayan Sharma vs Union Of India on 2 January, 2023
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/164842744/
121
of the Constitution of India, and was, therefore, ultra vires the
Constitution of India. Though this Court held that Section 38
is an unreasonable restriction on the right of the Palai Bank to
carry on its business and, therefore, unconstitutional, it will be
relevant to refer to paragraph 46 of the said judgment, which is
as follows:
          “46. In the present case, in view of the
          history of the establishment of the
          Reserve Bank as a central bank for
          India, its position as a Bankers' Bank,
          its control over banking companies and
          banking in India, its position as the
                               165
�         issuing bank, its power to license
         banking companies and cancel their
         licences and the numerous other powers,
         it is unanswerable that between the
         court and the Reserve Bank, the
         momentous decision to wind up a
         tottering or unsafe banking company in
         the interests of the depositors, may
         reasonably be left to the Reserve Bank.
         No doubt, the court can also, given the
         time, perform this task. But the decision
         has to be taken without delay, and the
         Reserve Bank already knows intimately
         the affairs of banking companies and has
         had access to their books and accounts.
         If the court were called upon to take
         immediate action, it would almost always
         be guided by the opinion of the Reserve
         Bank. It would be impossible for the
         court to reach a conclusion unguided
         by the Reserve Bank if immediate
         action was demanded. But the law
         which gives the same position to the
         opinion of the Reserve Bank is
         challenged as unreasonable. In our
         opinion, such a challenge has no
         force.….”
                                [emphasis supplied]
196. The Court has referred to the pivotal role that the RBI

Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/164842744/
122
plays as a Central Bank, as a bankers’ bank and numerous
                             166
�other powers that it exercises.     The Court held that the law
which gives an important position to the opinion of the Reserve
Bank was challenged unreasonably and such challenge had no
force.
197. It may also be relevant to         refer to the following
observations of this Court in the case of Peerless General
Finance and Investment Co. Limited and another (supra):
          “30. Before examining the scope and
          effect of the impugned paragraphs (6)
          and (12) of the directions of 1987, it is
          also important to note that Reserve Bank
          of India which is bankers' bank is a
          creature of statute. It has large
          contingent of expert advice relating
          to matters affecting the economy of
          the entire country and nobody can
          doubt the bona fides of the Reserve
          Bank in issuing the impugned
          directions of 1987. The Reserve Bank
          plays an important role in the
          economy and financial affairs of
          India and one of its important
          functions is to regulate the banking
          system in the country. It is the duty
          of the Reserve Bank to safeguard the
          economy and financial stability of
          the country….”
                              167
�                                 [emphasis supplied]
198.   It can thus be seen that this Court has noted that the
RBI, which is a bankers' bank, is a creature of statute. It has
large contingent of expert advice relating to matters affecting
Vivek Narayan Sharma vs Union Of India on 2 January, 2023
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/164842744/
123
the economy of the entire country. It has been held that the
RBI plays an important role in the economy and financial
affairs of India and one of its important functions is to regulate
the banking system in the country. It has been held that it is
the duty of the RBI to safeguard the economy and financial
stability of the country.
199. It will also further be relevant to refer to the following
observations of this Court in the case of Peerless General
Finance and Investment Co. Limited and another (supra):
          “The function of the Court is not to
          advise   in   matters   relating   to
          financial and economic policies for
          which bodies like Reserve Bank are
          fully competent. The Court can only
          strike down some or entire directions
          issued by the Reserve Bank in case
          the Court is satisfied that the
          directions were wholly unreasonable
                               168
�          or violative of any provisions of the
          Constitution or any statute. It would
          be hazardous and risky for the courts
          to tread an unknown path and
          should leave such task to the expert
          bodies. This Court has repeatedly
          said that matters of economic policy
          ought to be left to the government.”
                                [emphasis supplied]
200. The Court has held that it is not permissible for a Court to
advise in matters relating to financial and economic policies for
which bodies like Reserve Bank are fully competent.       It has
been held that it would be risky and hazardous for the courts
to tread an unknown path and should leave such task to the
expert bodies.

201. Recently a three-Judge Bench of this Court, speaking
through one of us (V. Ramasubramanian, J.), in the case of
Internet and Mobile Association of India (supra) observed
thus:
          “141. But as pointed out elsewhere, RBI
          is the sole repository of power for the
          management of the currency, under
          Section 3 of the RBI Act. RBI is also
                               169
�          vested with the sole right to issue
          bank notes under Section 22(1) and to
          issue currency notes supplied to it by
          the Government of India and has an
          important role to play in evolving the
          monetary policy of the country, by
          participation in the Monetary Policy
          Committee which is empowered to
          determine the policy rate required to
          achieve the inflation target, in terms
          of the consumer price index. Therefore,
          anything that may pose a threat to or
          have an impact on the financial system of
          the country, can be regulated or
          prohibited by RBI, despite the said
          activity not forming part of the credit
          system     or    payment system.     The
          expression      “management      of   the
          currency” appearing in Section 3(1) need
          not necessarily be confined to the
          management of what is recognised in law
          to be currency but would also include
          what is capable of faking or playing the
          role of a currency.”
                                 [emphasis supplied]
202. It can thus be seen that this Court has held that the RBI
is the sole repository of power for the management of currency.
It is also vested with the sole right to issue bank notes and to
issue currency notes supplied to it by the Government of India.
Vivek Narayan Sharma vs Union Of India on 2 January, 2023

125
                              170
�It has been held that the RBI has an important role to play in
evolving the monetary policy of the country.
Application of the aforesaid principles to the present case
203. It is thus clear that this Court has consistently recognised
the role assigned to the RBI in management and issuance of
currency notes, so also in evolving monetary policy of the
country.   We have referred to the aforesaid judgments with
regard to the primary status of RBI in dealing with the
management and regulation of currency and in evolving the
monetary policy of the country. Insofar as the decision to be
taken by the Central Government under sub-section (2) of
Section 26 of the RBI Act is concerned, it is to be taken on the
recommendation of the Central Board. We, therefore, find that
there is an inbuilt safeguard in sub-section (2) of Section 26 of
the RBI Act inasmuch as the Central Government is required to
take a decision on the recommendation of the RBI.
                               171
b04. As already discussed hereinabove, the RBI has large
contingent of expert advice available to it. It has a pivotal role
in issuance and management of and all other matters relating
to currency and also in evolving monetary policy of the country.
We may gainfully refer to the Constitution Bench Judgment of
this Court in the case of Harakchand Ratanchand Banthia
and others (supra) wherein, though the Constitution Bench
Vivek Narayan Sharma vs Union Of India on 2 January, 2023
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/164842744/
126
found clause (b) sub-section (2) of Section 5 of the Gold
(Control) Act, 1968 to be unconstitutional on the ground of vice
of excessive delegation, it upheld the provisions of clause (a)
sub-section (2) of Section 5 of the Gold (Control) Act, 1968,
finding that there was an inbuilt safeguard inasmuch as the
Administrator was required to take a decision after consultation
with the RBI.
205. For considering the question as to whether the RBI Act
provides guidance to the delegatee or not, the entire scheme,
object and the purpose of the Act has to be taken into
consideration. The guidance could be sought from the express
                               172
�provision empowering delegation or the other provisions of the
statute, the preamble, the scheme or even the very subject-
matter of the statute. If the guidance could be found in
whatever part of the Act, the delegation has to be held to be
valid. A great amount of latitude has to be given in such
matters. It has been consistently held that Parliament and the
State Legislatures are not bodies of expert or specialists. They
are skilled in the art of discovering the aspirations, the
expectations and the needs of the people whom they represent.
It has been held that they function best when they concern
themselves with general principles, broad objectives and
fundamental issues     instead of technical and situational
intricacies which are better left to better equipped full time
expert executive bodies and specialist public servants.

127
206. As already discussed herein above, the RBI has been
constituted to regulate the issue of bank notes. The RBI is an
expert body entrusted with various functions with regard to
monetary and economic policies. Perusal of the scheme of the
                               173
�RBI Act would reveal that it has a primary role in the matters
pertaining to the management and regulation of currency. We,
therefore, find that there is sufficient guidance to the delegatee
when it exercises its powers under sub-section (2) of Section 26
of the RBI Act, from the subject matter of the statute, and the
other provisions of the Act. In any case, as already discussed
herein above, Parliament has provided an inbuilt safeguard i.e.
recommendation of the RBI.      It is equally settled that insofar
as the economic, monetary and fiscal policies are concerned,
the same are best left to the experts possessing requisite
knowledge.   The RBI as well as the Central Government are
bodies having contingent of experts in the field.         It will,
therefore, not be proper for the Court to enter into an area
which should be best left to the experts.
207. We are of the considered view that there is sufficient
guidance in the preamble as well as the scheme and the object
of the RBI Act. As already discussed herein above, there cannot
be a straitjacket formula, and the question whether excessive
                               174
�delegation has been conferred or not has to be decided on the
basis of the scheme, the object and the purpose of the statute
Vivek Narayan Sharma vs Union Of India on 2 January, 2023
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/164842744/
128
under consideration.
208. One   another     aspect   that   needs   to   be   taken   into
consideration is the nature of the body to which the delegation
is to be made. In the present case, the delegation is made to
the Central Government and not to any ordinary body.
209. In the case of Birla Cotton, Spinning and Weaving
Mills Delhi (supra), the seven-Judge Bench of this Court held
that the delegation was made to an elected body, responsible to
the people including those who pay taxes. It observed that the
councillors have to go for election every four years. It was also
observed that if the councillors behave unreasonably, and the
inhabitants of the area so consider it, they can be thrown out at
the ensuing elections. This Court found that this was a great
check on the elected councillors acting unreasonably and fixing
unreasonable rates of taxation. It has been held that this was a
                                175
�democratic    method        of     bringing    to    book   the     elected
representatives who act unreasonably in such matters.
210. In the present case also, the delegation is to the Central
Government, i.e. the highest executive body of the country. We
have a Parliamentary system in which the Government is
responsible to the Parliament. In case the Executive does not
act   reasonably    while        exercising   its   power   of    delegated
legislation, it is responsible to Parliament who are elected
representatives of the citizens for whom there exists a
Vivek Narayan Sharma vs Union Of India on 2 January, 2023
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/164842744/
129
democratic    method        of     bringing    to    book   the     elected
representatives who act unreasonably in such matters.
211. Taking into consideration all these factors, we are of the
considered view that sub-section (2) of Section 26 of the RBI
Act does not suffer from the vice of excessive delegation.
ISSUE NO. (iii) :   AS       TO       WHETHER         THE    IMPUGNED
NOTIFICATION DATED 8TH NOVEMBER 2016 IS LIABLE TO
                                      176
�BE STRUCK DOWN ON THE GROUND THAT THE DECISION-
MAKING PROCESS IS FLAWED IN LAW?
212. It is sought to be urged on behalf of the petitioners that
the decision-making process both at the stage of making
recommendations by the Central Board and at the stage of
taking decision by the Central Government is flawed inasmuch
as the same had been done without considering the relevant
factors and eschewing the irrelevant ones. It is also sought to
be urged that, as per the scheme of sub-section (2) of Section
26 of the RBI Act, it is incumbent that the procedure should
emanate from the Central Board and not from the Central
Government. According to the petitioners, in the present case,
the procedure has emanated from the Central Government vide
its letter dated 7th November 2016 advising the Board to
convene a meeting and make a recommendation, which was
hurriedly convened on the next day, i.e., 8th November 2016, in
which the Board decided to recommend demonetization and,

130
                              177
�within hours, the decision was announced by the Hon’ble Prime
Minister.
213. It is submitted that, taking into consideration the hasty
manner in which the recommendation was sought by the
Central Government, and was then made by the Central Board
and the decision was taken thereupon by the Cabinet, there
was no scope for the Central Board or the Cabinet to take into
consideration the relevant factors and eschew the irrelevant
factors. It is, therefore, submitted that the decision was taken
in a patently arbitrary manner and as such, the impugned
Notification is liable to be set aside on the ground of patent
arbitrariness. It is also the contention of the petitioners that, in
the meeting of the Central Board, there was no quorum as
required in the 1949 Regulations.
214. On the contrary, it is the submission of the respondents
that there are twin requirements in sub-section (2) of Section
26 of the RBI Act, viz., (i) recommendation of the Central Board;
                                178
�and (ii) the decision of the Central Government. It is submitted
that both these requirements are satisfied in the present case.
It is submitted that, in an action like the present one,
confidentiality and speed are of utmost importance.
Scope of Judicial Review
215. The law with regard to scope of judicial review has been
Vivek Narayan Sharma vs Union Of India on 2 January, 2023
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/164842744/
131
very well crystalized in the case of Tata Cellular (supra). In
the said case, it has been held by this Court that the duty of
the court is to confine itself to the question of legality. Its
concern should be whether a decision-making authority
exceeded its powers, committed an error of law, committed a
breach of the rules of natural justice, reached a decision which
no reasonable tribunal would have reached or abused its
powers. The Court held that it is not for the court to determine
whether a particular policy or particular decision taken in the
fulfillment of that policy is fair. It is only concerned with the
manner in which those decisions have been taken.
                               179
b16. After referring to various pronouncements on the scope of
judicial review, the Court has summed-up thus:
          “94. The principles deducible from the
          above are:
               (1) The modern trend points to
               judicial       restraint    in
               administrative action.
               (2) The court does not sit as a
               court of appeal but merely
               reviews the manner in which the
               decision was made.
               (3) The court does not have the
               expertise     to   correct    the
               administrative decision. If a
               review of the administrative
               decision is permitted it will be
               substituting its own decision,
               without the necessary expertise
               which itself may be fallible.
               (4) The terms of the invitation to
               tender cannot be open to judicial
               scrutiny because the invitation to
               tender is in the realm of contract.
               Normally speaking, the decision
               to accept the tender or award the
Vivek Narayan Sharma vs Union Of India on 2 January, 2023
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/164842744/
132
               contract is reached by process of
               negotiations    through     several
               tiers. More often than not, such
               decisions are made qualitatively
               by experts.
                              180
�                (5) The Government must have
                freedom of contract. In other
                words, a fair play in the joints is
                a necessary concomitant for an
                administrative body functioning
                in an administrative sphere or
                quasi-administrative       sphere.
                However, the decision must not
                only be tested by the application
                of Wednesbury principle of
                reasonableness (including its
                other facts pointed out above) but
                must be free from arbitrariness
                not affected by bias or actuated
                by mala fides.
                (6) Quashing decisions may
                impose   heavy   administrative
                burden on the administration
                and lead to increased and
                unbudgeted expenditure.
          Based on these principles we will
          examine the facts of this case since they
          commend to us as the correct
          principles.”
217. Though various authorities are cited at the Bar with
regard to scope of judicial review, we do not find it necessary to
refer to various judgments.     We may gainfully refer to the
judgment of this Court in the case of Rashmi Metaliks
Limited and Another v. Kolkata Metropolitan Development
                               181
�Authority and Others62, wherein this Court has deprecated
the practice of citing several decisions when the law on the
Vivek Narayan Sharma vs Union Of India on 2 January, 2023
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/164842744/
133
issue is still covered by what has been held in the case of Tata
Cellular (supra).
218. Our enquiry, therefore,     will have to be restricted to
examining the decision-making process on the limited grounds
as have been laid down in the case of Tata Cellular (supra).
Scope of Judicial Interference in matters pertaining to
economic policy
219. Since the issue involved is also related to monetary and
economic policy of the country, we would also be guided by
certain other pronouncements of this Court.
220. We may gainfully refer to the following observations of the
Seven-Judge Bench in the case of M/s. Prag Ice & Oil Mills
and Another v. Union of India63:
62
     (2013) 10 SCC 95
63
     (1978) 3 SCC 459
                               182
�               “24. We have listened to long arguments
               directed at showing us that producers
               and sellers of oil in various parts of the
               country will suffer so that they would
               give up producing or dealing in mustard
               oil. It was urged that this would, quite
               naturally, have its repercussions on
               consumers for whom mustard oil will
               become even more scarce than ever
               ultimately. We do not think that it is
               the function of this Court or of any
               Court to sit in judgment over such
               matters of economic policy as must
               necessarily be left to the Government
               of the day to decide. Many of them,
               as a measure of price fixation must

               necessarily be, are matters of
               prediction of ultimate results on
               which even experts can seriously err
               and doubtlessly differ. Courts can
               certainly not be expected to decide
               them without even the aid of experts.”
                                      [emphasis supplied]
221. In the case of R.K. Garg v. Union of India and Others64,
another Constitution Bench of this Court observed thus:
               “8. Another rule of equal importance is
               that laws relating to economic activities
               should be viewed with greater latitude
               than laws touching civil rights such as
               freedom of speech, religion etc. It has
               been said by no less a person than
64
     (1981) 4 SCC 675
                                   183
�               Holmes, J., that the legislature should
               be allowed some play in the joints,
               because it has to deal with complex
               problems which do not admit of
               solution through any doctrinaire or
               strait-jacket formula and this is
               particularly    true    in    case    of
               legislation dealing with economic
               matters, where, having regard to the
               nature of the problems required to be
               dealt with, greater play in the joints
               has to be allowed to the legislature.
               The court should feel more inclined to
               give judicial deference to legislative
               judgment in the field of economic
               regulation than in other areas where
               fundamental human rights are involved.
               ……….”
                                    [emphasis supplied]
222. Again, the Constitution Bench of this Court in the case of
Shri Sitaram Sugar Company Limited and Another v.
Union of India and Others65, observed thus:
                “57. Judicial review is not concerned
                with matters of economic policy. The

                court    does   not    substitute    its
                judgment for that of the legislature
                or its agents as to matters within the
                province of either. The court does not
                supplant the “feel of the expert” by
                its own views. When the legislature acts
65
     (1990) 3 SCC 223
                                   184
�          within the sphere of its authority and
          delegates power to an agent, it may
          empower the agent to make findings
          of fact which are conclusive provided
          such findings satisfy the test of
          reasonableness. In all such cases,
          judicial inquiry is confined to the
          question whether the findings of fact are
          reasonably based on evidence and
          whether such findings are consistent
          with the laws of the land. As stated by
          Jagannatha Shetty, J. in Gupta Sugar
          Works [1987 Supp SCC 476, 481] : (SCC
          p. 479, para 4)
               “... the court does not act like a
               chartered accountant nor acts
               like an income tax officer. The
               court is not concerned with any
               individual case or any particular
               problem.     The    court     only
               examines whether the price
               determined was with due regard
               to considerations provided by the
               statute. And whether extraneous
               matters have been excluded from
               determination.””
                                [emphasis supplied]
223. Recently, this Court in the case of Small Scale Industrial
Manufactures Association (Registered) v. Union of India
                              185
�and Others66 had an occasion to consider the issue with regard
to scope of judicial review of economic and fiscal regulatory

measures. This Court observed thus:
                “69. What is best in the national
                economy and in what manner and to
                what       extent       the       financial
                reliefs/packages be formulated, offered
                and implemented is ultimately to be
                decided by the Government and RBI on
                the aid and advice of the experts. The
                same is a matter for decision exclusively
                within the province of the Central
                Government. Such matters do not
                ordinarily attract the power of judicial
                review.     Merely      because       some
                class/sector may not be agreeable
                and/or       satisfied      with      such
                packages/policy decisions, the courts, in
                exercise of the power of judicial review,
                do not ordinarily interfere with the policy
                decisions, unless such policy could be
                faulted on the ground of mala fides,
                arbitrariness, unfairness, etc.
                70. There are matters regarding which
                the Judges and the lawyers of the courts
                can hardly be expected to have much
                knowledge by reasons of their training
                and expertise. Economic and fiscal
66
     (2021) 8 SCC 511
                                     186
�regulatory measures are a field where
Judges should encroach upon very
warily as Judges are not experts in these
matters.
71. The correctness of the reasons which
prompted the Government in decision
taking one course of action instead of
another is not a matter of concern in
judicial review and the court is not the
appropriate forum for such investigation.
The policy decision must be left to the
Government as it alone can adopt which
policy    should    be    adopted    after
considering of the points from different
angles. In assessing the propriety of the
decision of the Government the court
cannot interfere even if a second view is
possible from that of the Government.

137
72. Legality of the policy, and not the
wisdom or soundness of the policy, is
the subject of judicial review. The scope
of judicial review of the governmental
policy is now well defined. The courts do
not and cannot act as an appellate
authority examining the correctness,
stability and appropriateness of a policy,
nor are the courts advisers to the
executives on matters of policy which the
executives are entitled to formulate.”
                    187
b24. This Court observed that the Court would not interfere
with any opinion formed by the government if it is based on the
relevant facts and circumstances or based on expert’s advice.
The Court would be entitled to interfere only when it is found
that the action of the executive is arbitrary and violative of any
constitutional, statutory or other provisions of law. It has been
held that when the government forms its policy, it is based on a
number of circumstances and it is also based on expert’s
opinion, which must not be interfered with, except on the
ground of palpable arbitrariness.    It is more than settled that
the Court gives a large leeway to the executive and the
legislature in matters of economic policy.    A reference in this
respect could be made to the judgments of this Court in the
cases of P.T.R. Exports (Madras) Pvt. Ltd. v. Union of India
and others67 and Bajaj Hindustan Limited v. Sir Shadi Lal
Enterprises Limited and another (supra).
67
     (1996) 5 SCC 268
Vivek Narayan Sharma vs Union Of India on 2 January, 2023
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/164842744/
138
                               188
b25. It is not the function of this Court or of any other Court to
sit in judgment over such matters of economic policy and they
must necessarily be left to the Government of the day to decide
since in such matters with regard to the prediction of ultimate
results, even the experts can seriously err and doubtlessly
differ. The Courts can certainly not be expected to decide them
without even the aid of experts.
Application of the aforesaid principles to the present case
226. Therefore, while exercising the power of judicial review in
a matter like the present one, the scope of interference would
be still narrower.   Applying the principles laid down in the
aforesaid judgments, we will have to examine as to whether the
decision-making process in the present case is flawed or not.
Our inquiry has to be limited only to find out as to whether
there is an illegality in the decision-making process, i.e.
whether the decision makers have understood the law correctly
which regulates the decision-making power and as to whether
                               189
�the decision-making process is vitiated by irrationality, i.e. the
Wednesbury principles. The test that would have to be applied
is that the decision is such that no authority properly
conducting itself on the relevant law and acting reasonably
could have reached thereat, and as to whether there has been a
Vivek Narayan Sharma vs Union Of India on 2 January, 2023

139
procedural impropriety.
227. The learned Senior Counsel for the petitioners vehemently
submitted that unless the letter dated 7th November 2016,
Minutes of the Meeting of the Central Board dated 8th November
2016 and the Note for the Cabinet Meeting dated 8th November
2016 are perused by this Court, it will not be possible for the
Court to satisfy itself as to whether the Central Board while
deciding   to   recommend    demonetization   and   the   Central
Government while deciding to take the decision in favour of
demonetization have taken into consideration the relevant
factors and eschewed the irrelevant factors. While closing the
matters for judgment/order, we had directed the Union of India
                               190
�and the RBI to produce the relevant records for our perusal.
Accordingly, the records were produced by the respondents.
228. We   have   scrutinized   the   entire   record,   i.e.,   the
communication dated 7th November 2016 addressed by the
Secretary, Department of Economic Affairs, Ministry of Finance
to the Governor, RBI, the Minutes of the Meeting of the Central
Board dated 8th November 2016, the recommendations by the
RBI dated 8th November 2016 and the Note for the Cabinet
Meeting held on 8th November 2016.
229. A perusal of the communication dated 7th November 2016
addressed by the Secretary, Department of Economic Affairs,
Ministry of Finance, Government of India to the Governor, RBI
would reveal that the Government of India has shared its
Vivek Narayan Sharma vs Union Of India on 2 January, 2023
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/164842744/
140
concern with regard to infusion of Fake Indian Currency Notes
(FICN) and generation of black money. It has been pointed out
that FICN infusion is concentrated in the two highest
denominations of Indian banknotes of Rs.500/- and Rs.1000/-.
                               191
�It has also been pointed out that the impact on the economy in
the high denomination notes is very adverse. The said
communication mentions the White Paper on Black Money by
the Department of Revenue in the year 2012, wherein it is
mentioned that cash has always been a facilitator of black
money since transactions made in cash do not leave any audit
trail. The White Paper also refers to the growth in the size of
the shadow economy of the country, and that a parallel shadow
economy corrodes and eats into the vitals of the country’s
economy.
230. The   said    communication         thereafter     refers   to   the
constitution of a Special Investigation Team (SIT) headed by two
former   Judges    of   this   Court,    which    has     made    strong
observations against the cash economy. It further refers to the
steps taken by the Government to reduce black money in the
economy.   After   pointing     out     the   aforesaid    factors,   the
communication advises the Central Board to take note of the
above and consider making necessary recommendations.                   It
                                 192
�also requests the RBI to prepare a draft scheme to implement
Vivek Narayan Sharma vs Union Of India on 2 January, 2023
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/164842744/
141
the   above   in   a   non-disruptive   manner   with   as   little
inconvenience to the public and business entities as possible.
231. We have also perused the Minutes of the Five Hundred
and Sixty First (561st) Meeting of the Central Board of Directors
of the RBI held on 8th November 2016. The said Minutes would
show that the communication dated 7th November 2016 was
placed before the Central Board by the Deputy Governor. There
was an elaborate discussion on the said proposal. The Central
Board has considered the pros and cons of the measure. The
Central Board has also considered that the proposed step
presents a big opportunity to take the process of financial
inclusion further by incentivizing the use of electronic modes of
payment, so that people see the benefits of bank accounts and
electronic means of payment over use of cash.       The Central
Board has taken into consideration that the matter had been
under discussion between the Central Government and the RBI
                                193
�for the last six months during which most of the issues raised
in the meeting were considered.
232. After detailed deliberations, the Central Board resolved to
recommend withdrawal of legal tender of bank notes in the
denomination of Rs.500/- and Rs.1000/- of existing and any
older series in circulation. Thereafter, the Deputy Governor,
vide communication dated 8th November 2016, informed the
Secretary, Department of Economic Affairs, Ministry of Finance,
Vivek Narayan Sharma vs Union Of India on 2 January, 2023
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/164842744/
142
Government of India about the above recommendations of the
Central Board.     Not only that, but a draft scheme for
implementation of the same was also enclosed along with the
said recommendations.
233. We have also perused the Note for the Cabinet for
consideration of the Cabinet Meeting dated 8th November 2016.
The Note for the Cabinet contains details about the relevant
data available as per Economic Survey for 2014-15 and 2015-
16 and the report of the Intelligence Bureau with regard to
                              194
�infusion of FICN and generation of black money.           It also
contains the details with regard to the 2012 White Paper on
Black Money. It contains the details with regard to the report
of the SIT headed by two former Judges of this Court and their
recommendations. It considers the recommendation of the RBI.
234. Upon perusal of the material on record, we are of the
considered view that the Central Board had taken into
consideration   the   relevant    factors   while   recommending
withdrawal of legal tender of bank notes in the denomination of
Rs.500/- and Rs.1000/- of existing and any older series in
circulation. Similarly, all the relevant factors were placed for
consideration before the Cabinet when it took the decision to
demonetize. It is to be noted that a draft scheme to implement
the proposal for demonetization in a non-disruptive manner
with as little inconvenience to the public and business entities
as possible was also prepared by the RBI along with the
Vivek Narayan Sharma vs Union Of India on 2 January, 2023
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/164842744/
143
recommendation for demonetization. The same was also taken
into consideration by the Cabinet.      As such, we are of the
                                 195
�considered view that the contention that the decision-making
process suffers from non-consideration of relevant factors and
eschewing of the irrelevant factors, is without substance.
235. Insofar as the contention of the petitioners that there was
no quorum as required under the 1949 Regulations is
concerned, in both the affidavits of the RBI dated 15th
November 2022 and 19th December 2018, a categorical
statement has been made that the requisite procedure as laid
down under sub-section (2) of Section 26 of the RBI Act read
with Regulations 8 and 10 of the 1949 Regulations was duly
followed.
236. A perusal of the Minutes of the Meeting of the Central
Board would also show that eight Directors were present in the
Meeting whereas the quorum for the meeting is four Directors
of whom not less than three shall be Directors nominated
under Section 8(1)(b) or Section 8(1)(c) or Section 12 (4) of the
                               196
�RBI Act. In the affidavit filed before this Court on 6th December
2022, it is specifically averred as under:
           “6. That the 561st meeting of the Central
           Board of the answering respondent was
           held on 08.11.2016 at New Delhi and
           business was transacted therein with
           the requisite quorum. During the said
Vivek Narayan Sharma vs Union Of India on 2 January, 2023
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/164842744/
144
           meeting, apart from the then Governor
           and two Deputy Governors, one director
           nominated under Section 8(1)(b) of RBI
           Act, two directors nominated under
           section 8(1)(c) of RBI Act and two
           directors nominated under section
           8(1)(d) of RBI Act were present. Thus,
           the requisite quorum of four directors of
           whom not less than three directors
           nominated under Section 8(1)(b) or
           8(1)(c) were present for the meeting.”
237. In that view of the matter, the contention that the Meeting
of the Central Board dated 8th November 2016 is not validly
held for want of quorum is concerned, is without substance.
Recommendation of the RBI
238. The next submission in this regard is that the procedure
prescribed under sub-section (2) of Section 26 of the RBI Act is
                                197
�breached inasmuch as the proposal has emanated from the
Central Government whereas the requirement under sub-
section (2) of Section 26 of the RBI Act is that the proposal
should emanate from the Central Board.      The contention is
that, since the Central Government is required to act on the
recommendation of the Central Board, the proposal should
emanate from the Central Board.
239. As already discussed hereinabove, the RBI has a pivotal
role insofar as monetary and economic policies are concerned
and, particularly, in all the matters pertaining to management
and regulation of currency. Moreover, perusal of Sections 22,
24 and 26 of the RBI Act would reveal that in various matters
Vivek Narayan Sharma vs Union Of India on 2 January, 2023
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/164842744/
145
pertaining to currency, the course of action is to be taken by
the Central Government on the recommendation of the Central
Board. It cannot be disputed that the final say with regard to
economic and monetary policies of the country will be with the
Central Government. However, in such matters, it has to rely
on the expert advice of the RBI. In a matter like the present
                             198
�one, it cannot be expected that the RBI and the Central
Government will act in two isolated boxes.      An element of
interaction/consultation in such important matters pertaining
to economic and monetary policies cannot be denied to the RBI
and the Central Government.
240. As already discussed hereinabove, the record would reveal
that the matter was under active consideration for a period of
six months between the RBI and the Central Government. As
such, merely because the Central Government has advised the
Central Board to consider recommending demonetization and
that the Central Board, on the advice of the Central
Government, has considered the proposal for demonetization
and recommended it and, thereafter, the Central Government
has taken a decision, in our view, cannot be a ground to hold
that the procedure prescribed under Section 26 of the RBI Act
was breached.    The two requirements of sub-section (2) of
Section 26 of the RBI Act are (i) recommendation by the Central
Board; and (ii) the decision by the Central Government. As
Vivek Narayan Sharma vs Union Of India on 2 January, 2023
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/164842744/
146
                              199
�already discussed hereinabove, both the Central Board while
making recommendation and the Central Government while
taking the decision, have taken into consideration all the
relevant factors.
241. The dictionary meaning of the word “recommend” is “to
advise as to a course of action”, or “to praise or commend”.
In P. Ramanatha Aiyar's Law Lexicon, the meaning of the word
“recommendation” is “a statement expressing commendation or
a message of this nature”.        The word “recommendation”,
therefore, will have to be construed in the context in which it is
used.         Reference in this respect would be made to the
judgments of this Court in the cases of V.M. Kurian v. State of
Kerala and others68 and Manohar s/o Manikrao Anchule v.
State of Maharashtra and another69.

�effecting demonetization. The said power has to be exercised
on the recommendation of the Central Board.         As already
discussed hereinabove, the RBI has a pivotal role in the matters
of monetary policy and issuance of currency.       The scheme
mandates that before the Central Government takes a decision

147
with regard to demonetization, it would be required to consider
the recommendation of the Central Board. We find that, in the
context in which it is used, the word “recommendation” would
mean a consultative process between the Central Board and the
Central Government.
243. In our view, therefore, the enquiry would be limited as to
whether there was an effective consultation between the Central
Government and the Central Board before the decision was
taken. Reference in this respect would be made to the following
observations of this Court in the case of State of Gujarat and
another v. Justice R.A. Mehta (Retired) and others (supra):
          “25. In State  of   Gujarat v. Gujarat

372, para 34), this Court held that the
object of consultation is to render its
process meaningful so that it may serve
its intended purpose. Consultation
requires the meeting of minds between
the parties that are involved in the
consultative process on the basis of
material facts and points in order to
arrive at a correct or at least a
satisfactory solution. If a certain power
can be exercised only after consultation
such consultation must be conscious,
effective, meaningful and purposeful. To
ensure this, each party must disclose to
the other all relevant facts for due
deliberation. The consultee must express
his    opinion   only     after    complete
consideration of the matter on the basis
of    all   the   relevant      facts  and
quintessence. Consultation may have
different meanings in different situations

nor effective before the parties thereto
make their respective points of view
known to the other or others and discuss
and examine the relative merits of their
views. If one party makes a proposal to
the other, who has a counter-proposal in
mind which is not communicated to the
proposer, a direction issued to give effect
to the counter-proposal without any
further discussion with respect to such
counter-proposal with the proposer
cannot be said to have been issued after
consultation.”

b44. As such, the enquiry would be limited to find out whether
both the Central Board and the Central Government had made
their respective points of view known to each other and
discussed and examined the relative merits of their views. It

will have to be considered whether each of the party had
disclosed to the other all relevant facts and factors for due
deliberation, or not. The limited enquiry would be whether the
recommendation by the Central Board was made after complete
consideration of the matter on the basis of all the relevant facts
and material before it, or not.
245. As already discussed herein above, the record itself reveals
that the RBI and the Central Government were in consultation
with each other for a period of six months before the impugned
notification was issued. The record would also reveal that all
the relevant information was shared by both the Central Board
as well as the Central Government with each other. As such, it
cannot be said that there was no conscious, effective,
meaningful and purposeful consultation.
                                  204
�Relevancy of attainment of objectives
246. Another submission that is being made is that the
objective with which the impugned Notification was issued, i.e.,
to combat fake currency, black money and parallel financing
are concerned, the same has utterly failed. It is submitted that
immediately after demonetization was effected, currency notes
of new series have been seized. It is also submitted that the
fake currency is also in vogue. New series of notes have been
seized from terrorists. Per contra, it is submitted that the long-
term benefits of demonetization have been enormous, direct
and indirect.   The learned Attorney General has placed on
Vivek Narayan Sharma vs Union Of India on 2 January, 2023

150
record an elaborate list of the same to which we have already
referred to in earlier paragraphs.
247. However, we do not wish to go into the question as to
whether the object with which demonetization was effected is
served or not or as to whether it has resulted in huge direct and
indirect benefits or not. We do not possess the expertise to go
                                205
�into that question and it is best that it should remain in the
domain of the experts.
248. The question is succinctly answered by the Supreme
Court of United States in the case of Metropolis Theater
Company et al., Plffs. In Err., v. City of Chicago and Ernest
J. Magerstadt. (supra), which reads thus:
          “2. The attack of complainants (we so
          call plaintiffs in error) is upon the
          classification of the ordinance. It is
          contended that the purpose of the
          ordinance is to raise revenue, and that
          its classification has no relation to such
          purpose, and therefore is arbitrarily
          discriminatory, and thereby offends the
          14th Amendment of the Constitution of
          the United States. The character
          ascribed to the ordinance by the
          supreme court of the state is not without
          uncertainty. But we may assume, as
          complainants assert, that the court
          considered the ordinance as a revenue
          measure only. The court said: 'The
          ordinance may be sustainable under the
          taxing power alone, without reference to
          its reasonableness as a regulatory
          measure.' And, regarding it as a revenue
          measure, complainants attack it as
          unreasonable in basing its classification
          upon the price of admission of a

151
                              206
�particular theater, and not upon the
revenue derived therefrom; and to exhibit
the discrimination which is asserted to
result, a comparison is made between
the seating capacity of complainants'
theaters and the number of their
performances within given periods, and
the theaters of others in the same
respects, and the resulting revenues. But
these are accidental circumstances and
dependent, as the supreme court of the
state said, upon the advantages of the
particular theater or choice of its owner,
and not determined by the ordinance, It
will immediately occur upon the most
casual reflection that the distinction the
theater itself makes is not artificial, and
must have some relation to the success
and ultimate profit of its business. In
other words, there is natural relation
between the price of admission and
revenue, some advantage, certainly, that
determines the choice. The distinction
obtains in every large city of the country.
The reason for it must therefore be
substantial; and if it be so universal in
the practice of the business, it would
seem not unreasonable if it be adopted
as the basis of governmental action. If
the action of government have such a
basis it cannot be declared to be so
palpably arbitrary as to be repugnant
to the 14th Amendment. This is the
test of its validity, as we have so
many times said. We need not cite the
                     207
�          cases. It is enough to say that we have
          tried, so far as that Amendment is
          concerned, to declare in words, and the
          cases illustrate by examples, the wide
          range which legislation has in classifying
          its objects. To be able to find fault
          with a law is not to demonstrate its
          invalidity. It may seem unjust and
          oppressive, yet be free from judicial
          interference.    The     problems       of
          government are practical ones and

          may justify, if they do not require,
          rough accommodations,—illogical, it
          may be, and unscientific. But even
          such criticism should not be hastily
          expressed. What is best is not always
          discernible; the wisdom of any choice
          may be disputed or condemned. Mere
          errors of government are not subject
          to our judicial review. It is only its
          palpably arbitrary exercises which
          can be declared void under the 14
          Amendment; and such judgment cannot
          be pronounced of the ordinance in
          controversy. Quong Wing v. Kirkendall,
          223 U. S. 59, 56 L. ed. 350, 32 Sup. Ct.
          Rep. 192.”
                                [emphasis supplied]
249. It has been held that if the action of the government has a
basis with the objectives to be achieved, it cannot be declared
as palpably arbitrary. It has been held that, to be able to find
                              208
�fault with a law is not to demonstrate its invalidity. It has been
held that the result of the act may seem unjust and oppressive,
yet be free from judicial interference.        The problems of
government are practical ones and may justify, if they do not
require, rough accommodations, illogical, it may be, and
unscientific.    But even such criticism should not be hastily
expressed.      It has been held that what is best is not always
discernible, and the wisdom of any choice may be disputed or
condemned. It has been held that mere errors of government
are not subject to judicial review.      It is only the palpably
arbitrary exercises which can be declared void.
250. We may gainfully refer to the following observations of this
Court in the case of R.K. Garg (supra), wherein this Court
Vivek Narayan Sharma vs Union Of India on 2 January, 2023
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/164842744/
153
observed that it should constantly remind itself of what the
Supreme Court of the United States said in the case of
Metropolis Theater Company (supra):
           “19. ……The Court would not have the
           necessary competence and expertise
           to adjudicate upon such an economic
                                209
�         issue. The Court cannot possibly
         assess or evaluate what would be the
         impact of a particular immunity or
         exemption and whether it would
         serve the purpose in view or not.
         There are so many imponderables that
         would enter into the determination that
         it would be wise for the Court not to
         hazard     an   opinion   where      even
         economists may differ. The Court must
         while examining the constitutional
         validity of a legislation of this kind,
         “be resilient, not rigid, forward
         looking, not static, liberal, not
         verbal” and the Court must always bear
         in mind the constitutional proposition
         enunciated by the Supreme Court of the
         United States in Munn v. Illinois [94 US
         13], namely, “that courts do not
         substitute their social and economic
         beliefs for the judgment of legislative
         bodies”. The Court must defer to
         legislative   judgment    in     matters
         relating to social and economic
         policies and must not interfere,
         unless the exercise of legislative
         judgment appears to be palpably
         arbitrary……”
                               [emphasis supplied]
251. The Constitution Bench holds that the Court would not
have the necessary competence and expertise to adjudicate
                            210
Vivek Narayan Sharma vs Union Of India on 2 January, 2023

154
�upon such an economic issue. The Court cannot possibly
assess or evaluate what would be the impact of a particular
immunity or exemption and whether it would serve the purpose
in view or not. It has been held that it would be wise for the
Court not to hazard an opinion where even economists may
differ. It has been held that while examining the constitutional
validity of such a legislation, the Court must “be resilient, not
rigid, forward looking, not static, liberal, not verbal”.
252. We are, therefore, of the considered view that the Court
must defer to legislative judgment in matters relating to social
and economic policies and must not interfere unless the
exercise of executive power appears to be palpably arbitrary.
The Court does not have necessary competence and expertise to
adjudicate upon such economic issues. It is also not possible
for the Court to assess or evaluate what would be the impact of
a particular action and it is best left to the wisdom of the
experts. In such matters, it will not be possible for the Court to
assess or evaluate what would be the impact of the impugned
                                 211
�action of demonetization.     The Court does not possess the
expertise to do so. As already discussed hereinabove, on one
hand, the petitioners urged that there has been an adverse
effect upon the economy and on the other hand, the learned
Attorney General had given a long list of direct and indirect
advantages of demonetization.         In any case, mere errors of
judgment by the government seen in retrospect is not subject to
Vivek Narayan Sharma vs Union Of India on 2 January, 2023
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/164842744/
155
judicial review. In such matters, legislative and quasi-legislative
authorities are entitled to a free play, and unless the action
suffers from patent illegality, manifest or palpable arbitrariness,
the Court should be slow in interfering with the same.
253. Another contention in this regard is that, on account of a
hasty decision by the Central Government, citizens had to suffer
at large, that many people were required to stand in the queues
for hours, that many citizens were deprived of their meals, and
that many citizens lost their jobs.
                                212
b54. As already discussed hereinabove, the Central Government
had advised the Central Board to draft a scheme to implement
demonetization in a non-disruptive manner with as little
inconvenience to the public and business entities as possible.
Accordingly, a draft scheme was also submitted by the Central
Board along with its recommendations for demonetization. It is
stated in the affidavit that the RBI has subsequently issued
relaxations from time to time taking into consideration the
difficulties of the people and availability of the new notes. No
doubt that on account of demonetization, the citizens were
faced with various hardships. However, we may again gainfully
refer to the following observations of this Court in the case of
R.K. Garg (supra):
          “8. ……The Court must therefore
          adjudge the constitutionality of such
          legislation by the generality of its
          provisions and not by its crudities or
          inequities or by the possibilities of
Vivek Narayan Sharma vs Union Of India on 2 January, 2023
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/164842744/
156
          abuse of any of its provisions. If any
          crudities, inequities or possibilities of
          abuse come to light, the legislature can
          always step in and enact suitable
                              213
�                amendatory legislation. That is the
                essence of pragmatic approach which
                must guide and inspire the legislature in
                dealing with complex economic issues.”
                                     [emphasis supplied]
255. Therefore, while adjudging the illegality of the impugned
Notification, we would have to examine on the basis as to
whether the objectives for which it was enacted has nexus with
the decision taken or not. If the impugned Notification had a
nexus with the objectives to be achieved, then, merely because
some citizens have suffered through hardships would not be a
ground to hold the impugned Notification to be bad in law.
256. In this respect, we may gainfully refer to the following
observations of this Court in the case of Km. Sonia Bhatia v.
State of U.P. and Others70:
                “29. Lastly, it was urged by Mr Kacker
                that this is an extremely hard case
                where the grandfather of the donee
                wanted to make a beneficial provision for
                his granddaughter after having lost his
                two sons in the prime of their life due to
70
     (1981) 2 SCC 585
                                    214
�air crash accidents while serving in the
Air Force. It is true that the District
Judge has come to a clear finding that
the gift in question is bona fide and has
Vivek Narayan Sharma vs Union Of India on 2 January, 2023
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/164842744/
157
been executed in good faith but as the
gift does not fulfil the other ingredients
of the section, namely, that it is not for
adequate consideration, we are afraid,
however laudable the object of the donor
may have been, the gift has to fail
because the genuine attempt of the
donor to benefit his granddaughter
seems to have been thwarted by the
intervention of sub-section (6) of Section
5 of the Act. This is undoubtedly a
serious hardship but it cannot be
helped. We must remember that the
Act is a valuable piece of social
legislation with the avowed object of
ensuring equitable distribution of the
land by taking away land from large
tenure-holders and distributing the
same among landless tenants or
using the same for public utility
schemes which is in the larger
interest of the community at large.
The Act seems to implement one of
the most important constitutional
directives contained in Part IV of the
Constitution of India. If in this
process a few individuals suffer
severe hardship that cannot be
helped, for individual interests must
yield to the larger interests of the
                    215
�           community or the country as indeed
           every noble cause claims its martyr.”
                               [emphasis supplied]
257. Though, the Court found that the Act caused a serious
hardship, it held that the Act is a valuable piece of social
legislation. It held that the Act was enacted to implement one of
the most important constitutional directives contained in Part
IV of the Constitution of India. It further observed that, if in this
process, a few individuals suffer severe hardship, that cannot
be helped. It further held that individual interests must yield to
Vivek Narayan Sharma vs Union Of India on 2 January, 2023
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/164842744/
158
the larger interests of the community or the country as indeed
every noble cause claims its martyr.
258. In any case now, the action which was taken by the
Central Government by the impugned Notification, has been
validated by the 2016 Ordinance and which has fructified in the
2017 Act.     The Central Government is answerable to the
Parliament and the Parliament, in turn, represents the will of
the citizens of the country. The Parliament has therefore put its
                                 216
�imprimatur on the executive action. This is apart from the fact
that we have not found any flaw in the decision-making process
as required under sub-section (2) of Section 26 of the RBI Act.
259. The decision-making process is also sought to be attacked
on the ground that the decision was taken in a hasty manner.
We find that the ‘hasty’ argument would be destructive of the
very purpose of demonetization. Such measures undisputedly
are required to be taken with utmost confidentiality and speed.
If the news of such a measure is leaked out, it is difficult to
imagine how disastrous the consequences would be.
260. It will be interesting to note again from Volume III of the
“History of the Reserve Bank of India” that, on 14 th January
1978, one R. Janakiraman, a senior official in the RBI was
asked by some officers of the Government of India to come
immediately to Delhi for some urgent work. When he asked for
what purpose he was called, he was told that the matters
Vivek Narayan Sharma vs Union Of India on 2 January, 2023
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/164842744/
159
relating to exchange control need to be discussed. He, however,
                               217
�took along with him one M. Subramaniam, a senior official of
the Exchange Control Department. On reaching Delhi, he was
informed that the Government had decided to demonetize the
high denomination notes and was required to draft the
necessary Ordinance within twenty-four hours. During the said
period, no communication was allowed with anyone including
the Bank’s central office at Bombay. R. Janakiraman and M.
Subramaniam made a request for the 1946 Ordinance on
demonetization to get an idea how it was to be drafted, which
request was acceded to by the Finance Ministry.          The draft
Ordinance was completed on schedule.        It was finalized and
sent for signature of the President of India in the early hours of
16th January 1978 and on the same day, the announcement to
that effect was made on All India Radio’s news bulletin at 09.00
a.m.
261. It can thus be seen that confidentiality and secrecy in
such sort of measures is of paramount importance.           When
demonetization   was    being   done   in   the   year   1978,   R.
                                218
�Janakiraman, who had drafted the Ordinance, was not
permitted to communicate with anyone including the Bank’s
central office at Bombay. It would thus show as to what great
degree of confidentiality was maintained.      In any case, the
Vivek Narayan Sharma vs Union Of India on 2 January, 2023
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/164842744/
160
material placed on record would show that the RBI and the
Central Government were in consultation with each other for at
least a period of six months preceding the action.
262. We, therefore, find that the impugned notification dated 8th
November 2016 does not suffer from any flaws in the decision-
making process.

BE      STRUCK         DOWN    APPLYING       THE    TEST    OF
PROPORTIONALITY?
263. It is sought to be urged on behalf of the petitioners that
before taking such a drastic measure, which caused enormous
hardship to a number of citizens, the government ought to have
                                   219
�found out as to whether there was an alternate course of action
which could have resulted in lesser hardship to the citizens. In
this respect, reliance is placed on the judgment of this Court in
the case of Internet and Mobile Association of India (supra)
and K.S. Puttaswamy (Retired) and another (Aadhaar)
(supra).
264. In the case of Internet and Mobile Association of India
(supra), the RBI had issued a directive to the entities regulated
by RBI (i) not to deal with or provide services to any individual
or business entities dealing with or settling virtual currencies
and (ii) to exit the relationship, if they already have one, with
such individuals/business entities, dealing with or settling

virtual currencies.
265. The said action came to be challenged by writ petition filed
under Article 32 of the Constitution of India. The challenge was
on several grounds, including the ground of proportionality.
Though the Court did not find favour with the other grounds
                               220
�raised on behalf of the petitioners therein, it held that the
concern of the RBI is and ought to be about the entities
regulated by it. It found that, till date, RBI had not come out
with a stand that any of the entities regulated by it, namely, the
nationalized banks/scheduled commercial banks/cooperative
banks/NBFCs had suffered any loss or adverse effect directly or
indirectly, on account of the interface that the virtual currency
exchanges had with any of them.       The Court held that there
must have been at least some empirical data about the degree
of harm suffered by the regulated entities. The Court, therefore,
while upholding the power of the RBI to take pre-emptive
action, upon testing the proportionality of the measure, found
that in the absence of RBI pointing out at least some semblance
of any damage suffered by its regulated entities, the impugned
measure was disproportionate.

Vivek Narayan Sharma vs Union Of India on 2 January, 2023
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/164842744/
162
Modern Dental College and Research Centre (supra), while
considering a balance between the right under Article 19(1)(g)
and the reasonable restrictions under clause (6) of Article 19 of
the Constitution of India, observed thus:
          “60. ……Thus, while examining as to
          whether the impugned provisions of the
          statute and rules amount to reasonable
          restrictions and are brought out in the
          interest of the general public, the
          exercise that is required to be
          undertaken      is    the    balancing    of
          fundamental       right    to   carry    on
          occupation on the one hand and the
          restrictions imposed on the other hand.
          This is what is known as “doctrine of
          proportionality”.         Jurisprudentially,
          “proportionality” can be defined as the
          set of rules determining the necessary
          and sufficient conditions for limitation of
          a constitutionally protected right by a
          law to be constitutionally permissible.
          According to Aharon Barak (former Chief
          Justice, Supreme Court of Israel), there
          are      four       sub-components        of
          proportionality which need to be
          satisfied [ Aharon Barak, Proportionality:
          Constitutional      Rights     and     Their
          Limitation (Cambridge University Press
          2012).], a limitation of a constitutional
                               222
�          right will be constitutionally permissible
          if:
                (i) it is designated for a proper
                purpose;
                (ii) the measures undertaken to
                effectuate such a limitation are
                rationally connected to the
                fulfilment of that purpose;
                (iii) the measures undertaken
                are necessary in that there are
                no alternative measures that
                may similarly achieve that
                same purpose with a lesser
                degree of limitation; and finally
                (iv) there needs to be a proper
                relation (“proportionality stricto

                sensu” or “balancing”) between
                the importance of achieving the
                proper purpose and the social
                importance of preventing the
                limitation on the constitutional
                right.”
267. The Constitution Bench held that while examining as to
whether the impugned provisions of the statute and rules
amount to reasonable restrictions and are brought out in the
interest of the general public, the exercise that is required to be
undertaken is balancing of the fundamental right to carry on
occupation on the one hand and the restrictions imposed on the
                                223
�other hand.    The Court refers to four tests of proportionality
which need to be satisfied. The first one is that it should be
designated for a proper purpose. The second one is that the
measures undertaken to effectuate such a limitation are
rationally connected to the fulfilment of that purpose. The third
one is that the measures undertaken are necessary in that
there are no alternative measures that may similarly achieve
that same purpose with a lesser degree of limitation. Finally,
the fourth one is that there needs to be a proper relation
between the importance of achieving the proper purpose and
the social importance of preventing the limitation on the
constitutional right.   The Court held that there has to be a
balance between a constitutional right and public interest. It
held that a constitutional licence to limit those rights is granted
where such a limitation will be justified to protect public

164
interest or the rights of others. It will also be relevant to refer to
the following observations of the Constitution Bench:
                                 224
�“65.      …..At     the     same      time,
reasonableness of a restriction has to be
determined in an objective manner and
from the standpoint of the interests of
the general public and not from the
point of view of the persons upon whom
the restrictions are imposed or upon
abstract considerations (see Mohd. Hanif
Quareshi v. State of Bihar [Mohd. Hanif
Quareshi v. State of Bihar, AIR 1958 SC
731 : 1959 SCR 629] ). In M.R.F.
Ltd. v. State       of       Kerala [M.R.F.
Ltd. v. State of Kerala, (1998) 8 SCC 227
: 1999 SCC (L&S) 1] , this Court held
that in examining the reasonableness of
a statutory provision one has to keep in
mind the following factors:
     (1) The directive principles of
     State policy.
     (2) Restrictions must not be
     arbitrary or of an excessive
     nature so as to go beyond the
     requirement of the interest of
     the general public.
     (3) In order to judge the
     reasonableness      of      the
     restrictions, no abstract or
     general pattern or a fixed
     principle can be laid down so
     as    to    be  of    universal
     application and the same will
     vary from case to case as also
     with     regard to    changing
     conditions, values of human
                     225
�                life, social philosophy of the
                Constitution,         prevailing
                conditions and the surrounding
                circumstances.
                (4) A just balance has to be
                struck between the restrictions
                imposed and the social control

                envisaged by Article 19(6).
                (5) Prevailing social values as
                also social needs which are
                intended to be satisfied by the
                restrictions.
                (6) There must be a direct and
                proximate nexus or reasonable
                connection       between     the
                restrictions imposed and the
                object sought to be achieved. If
                there is a direct nexus between
                the restrictions, and the object
                of the Act, then a strong
                presumption in favour of the
                constitutionality of the Act will
                naturally arise.”
268. It is pertinent to note that in the case of Modern Dental
College   and   Research     Centre   (supra),   the   Court   was
considering the validity of the Act and the Rules which
regulated primarily the admission of the students in post-
graduate courses in private educational institutions and the
                               226
�provisions    made      thereunder.      Applying    the    test   of
proportionality, the Court held that the larger public interest
warrants such a measure.         It held that, having regard to the
malpractices which are noticed in the Common Entrance Test
(CET) conducted by such private institutions themselves, it is,
undoubtedly, in the larger interest and welfare of the student
community to promote merit and excellence and to curb
malpractices. The Court held that the impugned provisions
which may amount to “restrictions” on the right of the
appellants therein to carry on their “occupation”, are clearly
“reasonable” and satisfy the test of proportionality.

269. The proportionality doctrine is sought to be placed in
service on the ground that in the case of Jayantilal
Ratanchand Shah (supra), the Court held the bank notes to be
property     and   as    such,   impugned    Notification   imposed
unreasonable restrictions, violative of Article 300-A of the
Constitution of India.
                                  227
b70. Let us test the four-pronged test culled out by Aharon
Barak, former Chief Justice, Supreme Court of Israel which
have been reproduced in the case of Modern Dental College
and Research Centre (supra).
271. The impugned Notification has been issued with an
objective to meet the following three concerns:
  (i)     Fake currency notes of the SBNs have been largely in
          circulation and it has been found to be difficult to easily
          identify genuine bank notes from the fake ones;
  (ii)    It has been found that high denomination bank notes
          were used for storage of unaccounted wealth which was
          evident from the large cash recoveries made by law
          enforcement agencies; and
  (iii)   It has also been found that fake currency is being used
          for   financing   subversive   activities   such   as   drug
          trafficking and terrorism, causing damage to the
          economy and security of the country.
Vivek Narayan Sharma vs Union Of India on 2 January, 2023
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/164842744/
167
                                  228
b72. For the purpose of achieving these objectives, the Central
Government, on the recommendations of the Central Board,
took a decision to demonetize the bank notes of denominational
value of Rs.500/- and Rs.1000/-. Assuming that holding bank
notes is a right under Article 300-A of the Constitution of India,
the limitation that is imposed is designated for a proper
purpose. By no stretch of imagination could it be said that the
aforesaid three purposes, i.e., elimination of fake currency,
black money and terror financing are not proper purposes. As
such, the first test is satisfied.
273. The second test is as to whether the measure undertaken
to effectuate such a limitation is rationally connected to the
fulfilment of that purpose - that would be the nexus test. The
question, therefore, is, as to whether the measures taken in the
present case have a reasonable nexus with the purpose to be
achieved?    As already discussed hereinabove, the purpose of
demonetization was to eliminate the fake currency notes, black
money, drug trafficking & terror financing.   Can it be said that
                                     229
�demonetizing high denomination bank notes of Rs.500/- and
Rs.1000/- does not have a reasonable nexus with the three
purposes sought to be achieved? We find that there is a
reasonable nexus between the measure of demonetization with
the aforesaid purposes of addressing issues of fake currency
bank notes, black money, drug trafficking & terror financing.
Vivek Narayan Sharma vs Union Of India on 2 January, 2023
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/164842744/
168
As such, the second test stands satisfied.
274. Insofar as the third test is concerned, it is required to be
examined as to whether the measure undertaken is necessary
in that there are no alternative measures that may similarly
achieve the same purpose with the lesser degree of limitation.
As held in the case of M.R.F. Ltd. v. Inspector Kerala Govt.
and Others71, to judge the reasonableness of the restrictions,
no abstract or general pattern or a fixed principle can be laid
down so as to be of universal application and the same will vary
from case to case. As to what measure is required to meet the
aforesaid objectives is exclusively within the domain of the
71
     (1998) 8 SCC 227
                               230
�experts.   The RBI, as already held, plays a material role in
economic    and   monetary    policy      and   issues    relating   to
management     and   regulation      of   currency.      The   Central
Government is the best judge since it has all the inputs with
regard to fake currency, black money, terror financing & drug
trafficking. As such, what measure is required to be taken to
curb the menace of fake currency, black money and terror
financing would be best left to the discretion of the Central
Government, in consultation with the RBI.             Unless the said
discretion has been exercised in a palpably arbitrary and
unreasonable manner, it will not be possible for the Court to
interfere with the same.
Vivek Narayan Sharma vs Union Of India on 2 January, 2023
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/164842744/
169
275. In any case, what alternate measure could have been
undertaken with a lesser degree of limitation is very difficult to
define. Whether the Courts possess an expertise to decide as to
whether demonetization of only Rs.500/- denomination notes
ought to have been done or the denomination of only the notes
of Rs.1000/- ought to have been done or as to whether
                               231
�particular series of the bank notes ought to have been
demonetized. These are all the areas which are purely within
the domain of the experts and beyond the arena of judicial
review.
276. Insofar as the fourth test, that is the proper relation
between the importance of achieving the proper purpose and
the social importance of preventing the limitation on the
constitutional right is concerned, can it really be said that there
is no proper relation between the importance of curbing the
menace of fake currency, black money, drug trafficking & terror
financing on one hand and demonetizing the Rs.500/- and
Rs.1000/- notes, thereby imposing restriction on the use of
demonetized currency?
277. In any case, by demonetization, the right vested in the
notes was not taken away.       The only restrictions were with
regard to exchange of old notes with the new notes, which were
also gradually relaxed from time to time. Insofar as deposit of
                                232
Vivek Narayan Sharma vs Union Of India on 2 January, 2023
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/164842744/
170
�the demonetized notes in banks is concerned, there was no
limitation. If a citizen had a ‘Know Your Customer (KYC)
compliant bank account’, he could deposit any amount and get
to his credit the full value of legitimate currency. As such, the
right to property in bank notes was not taken away.        A full
value of legitimate currency was entitled to be deposited in the
bank account, however, up to a particular date. In any case,
there was no restriction on non-cash transactions like debit
card, credit card, net banking, online transactions etc.
278. We find that the argument that the right to property was
sought to be taken away is without substance.       In any case,
even if there were reasonable restrictions on the said right, the
said restrictions were in the public interest of curbing evils of
fake currency, black money, drug trafficking & terror financing.
As such, we find that applying the four-pronged test, the
doctrine of proportionality is fully satisfied.
                                 233
b79. Insofar as reliance on the judgment of the Constitution
Bench of this Court in the case of K.S. Puttaswamy (Retired)
and another (Aadhaar) (supra) is concerned, in the facts of the
said case, the Constitution Bench found that, on account of
various measures taken by the Government to give a boost to
digital economy, millions of persons, who are otherwise poor,
had opened their bank accounts.      They were also becoming
habitual to the good practice of entering into transactions
through their banks and even by using digital modes for
Vivek Narayan Sharma vs Union Of India on 2 January, 2023
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/164842744/
171
operation of their bank accounts.         The Court, in this
background, found that making the requirement of Aadhaar
compulsory for all such and other persons in the name of
checking money laundering or black money was grossly
disproportionate.   The observations made therein were in the
context of the factual background that fell for consideration in
the said case. In our view, the said observations would not be
applicable to the facts of the present case.   We have already
considered in detail as to how, upon application of the four-
                              234
�pronged test of proportionality, the impugned notification
cannot be struck down.
280. In any case, in our view, there is a direct and proximate
nexus between the restrictions imposed and the objectives
sought to be achieved.      As held by this Court in the case of
M.R.F. Ltd. (supra), if there is a direct nexus between the
restrictions and the object of the action, then a strong
presumption in favour of the constitutionality of the action
naturally arises.
281. We, therefore, hold that the impugned notification dated
8th   November      2016   does   not   violate   the   principle   of
proportionality and as such, is not liable to be struck down on
the said ground.
ISSUE NO. (v): AS TO WHETHER THE PERIOD PROVIDED
FOR    EXCHANGE        OF    NOTES      VIDE      THE    IMPUGNED
NOTIFICATION DATED 8TH NOVEMBER 2016 CAN BE SAID
Vivek Narayan Sharma vs Union Of India on 2 January, 2023
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/164842744/
172
TO BE UNREASONABLE?
                                  235
b82. It is sought to be urged that the period provided for
exchange of old notes with the new notes under the impugned
Notification is unreasonable.
283. Under the 1978 Act, the Ordinance was notified on 16th
January 1978, which transformed into the Act on 30th March
1978. Under Section 3 of the 1978 Act, all high denomination
bank notes, notwithstanding anything contained in Section 26
of the RBI Act, ceased to be legal tender in payment or on
account at any place. Under Section 7 of the 1978 Act, every
person desiring to tender for exchange demonetized notes was
required to submit a declaration giving the particulars not later
than 19th January 1978.
284. Under Section 8 of the 1978 Act, a person who failed to
apply for exchange of any demonetized notes within the time
provided under Section 7 thereof, was entitled to tender the
notes together with a declaration required under Section 7
thereof along with the statement explaining the reasons for his
                                236
�or her failure to apply within the specified time limit.                Under
sub-section (2) of Section 8 of the 1978 Act, if the RBI was
satisfied with the reasons for the failure to submit the notes
prior to 19th January 1978 being genuine, it could pay the value
Vivek Narayan Sharma vs Union Of India on 2 January, 2023
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/164842744/
173
of the notes in the manner specified in sub-section (4) of Section
7 thereof. Under sub-section (3) of Section 8 thereof, an appeal
was provided before the Central Government against the refusal
of the RBI to pay the value of the notes.
285. It could thus be seen that under the 1978 Act, three days’
period was provided for exchanging the demonetized notes. If a
person could not avail of the said period, five days’ grace period
was made available during which period the money could be
exchanged        subject   to   the   RBI     being   satisfied   with    the
genuineness of the reasons for not submitting the same within
three days. As such, the period available to everyone was three
days which could be further extended by five days. A challenge
was raised on the ground that the period was unreasonable and
violative   of    the   fundamental         rights.   Rejecting   the    said
                                      237
�contention, the Constitution Bench in the case of Jayantilal
Ratanchand Shah (supra) observed thus:
         “10. It was, however, contended on
         behalf of the petitioners that even if it
         was assumed that Article 31 had not
         been violated, the time prescribed for
         exchange of the high denomination
         banknotes under Sections 7 and 8 of the
         Demonetisation Act was unreasonable
         and violative of their fundamental rights.
         When the above provisions of the Act
         are considered in the context of the
         purpose the Demonetisation Act
         sought to achieve, namely, to stop
         circulation of high denomination
         banknotes as early as possible, the
         above contention of the petitioners
         cannot be accepted. Consequent upon
         the high denomination banknotes
         ceasing to be legal tender on the

         expiry of 16-1-1978 and in view of the
         prohibition     in    the   transfer    of
         possession of such notes from one
         person to another thereafter as
         envisaged under Section 4, it was
         absolutely necessary to ensure that
         no opportunity was available to the
         holders     of     high    denomination
         banknotes to transfer the same to the
         possession of others. At the same
         time it was necessary to afford a
         reasonable opportunity to the holders
         of such notes to get the same
                             238
�exchanged. However, if the time for
such exchange was not limited the
high denomination banknotes could
be circulated and transferred without
the knowledge of the authorities
concerned from one person to another
and any such transferee could walk
into the Bank on any day thereafter
and demand exchange of his notes. In
that case it would have been wellnigh
impossible for the Bank to prove that
such a person was not the owner or
holder of the notes on 16-1-1978.
Needless    to   say  in    such   an
eventuality the very object which the
Demonetisation Act sought to achieve
would have been defeated. Obviously,
to strike a balance between these
competing         and        disparate
considerations Section 7(2) of the
Demonetisation Act limited the time
to exchange the notes till 19-1-1978.
However, even thereafter, in view of
Section 8, the high denomination
banknotes could be exchanged from
the Bank till 24-1-1978 provided the
tenderer was able to explain the
reasons for his failure to apply for
such exchange within the time
stipulated under Section 7(2) of the
Demonetisation Act. Apart from the
above provisions regarding exchange
of high denomination banknotes by
the Bank within the time stipulated
therein, provision has been made in

                  239
�         sub-section      (7)  of     Section    7,
         permitting the Central Government,
         for reasons to be recorded in writing,
         to extend in any case or class of
         cases the period during which high
         denomination banknotes may be
         tendered for exchange. From a
         combined reading of Sections 7 and 8 it
         is evidently clear that on furnishing a
         declaration complete in all particulars in
         accordance with sub-section (2) of
Section 7 by 19-1-1978, the holder was
         entitled to get the exchange value of his
         notes from the Bank without any let or
         hindrance; thereafter, till 24-1-1978, he
         was also entitled to such exchange from
         the Bank if he could satisfactorily
         explain the reasons for his inability to
         apply by 19-1-1978 and after that date
         the Central Government was empowered
         to extend the period of such exchange.
         Such being the scheme of the Act
         regarding       exchange       of    high
         denomination banknotes it cannot be
         said that the time and the manner in
         which      the     high     denomination
         banknotes could be exchanged were
         unreasonable, unjust and violative of
         the petitioners' fundamental rights.”
                               [emphasis supplied]
286. The Constitution Bench found that if the time for such
exchange was not limited, the high denomination bank notes
                             240
�could be circulated and transferred without the knowledge of
the authorities concerned, from one person to another and any
such transferee could walk into the Bank on any day thereafter
and demand exchange of his notes. It was held that, in such an
eventuality, the very object which the Demonetization Act
sought to achieve would have been defeated. The Court found
Vivek Narayan Sharma vs Union Of India on 2 January, 2023
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/164842744/
176
that between 16th January 1978 and 19th January 1978, the
holder was entitled to get the exchange value of his notes from
the Bank without any limit or hindrance. The challenge that
the period of three days was unreasonable, unjust and violative
of   the    petitioners’   fundamental   rights,   stood   specifically
rejected.
287. In the present case, the period for exchanging any amount
of SBNs and depositing the same in the KYC compliant bank
account without any limit or hindrance was 52 days, whereas
the said period in the case of Jayantilal Ratanchand Shah
(supra) was only three days, which is much less as compared to
the one provided by the impugned Notification. In the light of
                                  241
�what has been held by the Constitution Bench in the case of
Jayantilal Ratanchand Shah (supra), we fail to understand
as to how the said period of 52 days could be construed to be
unreasonable,   unjust   and    violative   of   the   petitioners’
fundamental rights.
288. We, therefore, hold that the period provided for exchange
of notes vide the impugned Notification dated 8th November
2016 cannot be said to be unreasonable.

SUB-SECTION (1) OF SECTION 4 OF THE 2017 ACT?
                               242
b89. It is sought to be urged by Shri Divan that the RBI has
independent power under sub-section (2) of Section 4 of the
2017 Act.
Contextual and harmonious construction of the provisions
of the 2017 Act.
290. For appreciating the said contention, it will be appropriate
to refer to Sections 3 and 4 of the 2017 Act, which read thus:
            “3. Specified bank notes to cease to be
            liability of Reserve Bank or Central
            Government.— On and from the
            appointed day, notwithstanding anything
            contained in the Reserve Bank of India
            Act, 1934 (2 of 1934) or any other law for
            the time being in force, the specified
            bank notes which have ceased to be legal
            tender, in view of the notification of the
            Government of India in the Ministry of
            Finance, number S.O. 3407(E), dated the
            8th November, 2016, issued under sub-
            section (2) of section 26 of the Reserve
            Bank of India Act, 1934, shall cease to
            be liabilities of the Reserve Bank under
section 34 and shall cease to have the
            guarantee of the Central Government
            under sub-section (1) of section 26 of the
            said Act.
            4. Exchange of specified bank notes.—
            (1) Notwithstanding anything contained
                                243
�in section 3, the following persons
holding specified bank notes on or before
the 8th day of November, 2016 shall be
entitled to tender within the grace period
with such declarations or statements, at
such offices of the Reserve Bank or in

such other manner as may be specified
by it, namely:—
(i) a citizen of India who makes a
declaration that he was outside India
between the 9th November, 2016 to 30th
December, 2016, subject to such
conditions as may be specified, by
notification, by the Central Government;
or
(ii) such class of persons and for such
reasons as may be specified by
notification, by the Central Government.
(2) The Reserve Bank may, if satisfied,
after making such verifications as it may
consider necessary that the reasons for
failure to deposit the notes within the
period specified in the notification
referred to in section 3, are genuine,
credit the value of the notes in his Know
Your Customer compliant bank account
in such manner as may be specified by
it.
(3) Any person, aggrieved by the refusal
of the Reserve Bank to credit the value of
the notes under sub-section (2), may
make a representation to the Central
Board of the Reserve Bank within
                    244
�          fourteen days of the communication of
          such refusal to him.
          Explanation.— For the purposes of this
          section, the expression “Know Your
          Customer compliant bank account”
          means the account which complies with
          the    conditions  specified  in   the
          regulations made by the Reserve Bank
          under the Banking Regulation Act, 1949
          (10 of 1949).”
291. The effect of Section 3 of the 2017 Act is that the SBNs,
which have ceased to be legal tender, in view of the impugned
Notification, shall cease to be liabilities of the RBI under Section
34 of the RBI Act and shall cease to have the guarantee of the
Central Government under sub-section (1) of Section 26 of the
Vivek Narayan Sharma vs Union Of India on 2 January, 2023
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/164842744/
179
RBI Act. The legislative intent under Section 3 of the 2017 Act
is to provide clarity and finality to the liabilities of the RBI and
the Central Government arising from such bank notes which
have ceased to be legal tender with effect from 9th November
2016.
292. Sub-section (1) of Section 4 of the 2017 Act provides that
notwithstanding anything contained in Section 3 of the 2017
                                245
�Act, a class of persons would be entitled to tender within the
grace period with such declarations or statements, at such
offices of the RBI or in such other manner as may be specified
by it. Clause (i) of sub-section (1) of Section 4 of the 2017 Act
deals with a citizen of India who makes a declaration that he
was outside India between 9th November 2016 and 30th
December, 2016, however, subject to such conditions as may be
specified, in the notification, by the Central Government.
Clause (ii) of sub-section (1) of Section 4 of the 2017 Act
empowers the Central Government to issue a notification with
regard to persons holding SBNs who would be entitled to tender
within the grace period for such reasons as may be specified in
the said notification.
293. It is thus clear that, though in view of the impugned
Notification and in view of Section 3 of the 2017 Act,
demonetized notes have ceased to be a legal tender and have
ceased to be the liabilities of the RBI under Section 34 of the
RBI Act and the guarantee of the Central Government under

�sub-section (1) of Section 26 of the RBI Act, a window is
provided by Section 4 of the 2017 Act. Clause (i) of sub-section
(1) of Section 4 of the 2017 Act deals with a citizen of India who
makes a declaration that he was outside India between 9th
November 2016 and 30th December, 2016, subject to such
conditions as may be specified, by notification, by the Central
Government.     Accordingly, a notification is issued by the
Central Government on 30th December 2016. In view of clause
(ii) of sub-section (1) of Section 4 of the 2017 Act, the Central
Government is empowered to provide a window for tendering
the SBNs which have otherwise ceased to be a legal tender to
such class of persons and for the reasons as may be specified in
the notification. Sub-section (2) of Section 4 of the 2017 Act
provides that the RBI, if satisfied with the reasons for failure to
deposit the notes within the period specified in the impugned
Notification, i.e., prior to 30th December 2016, are genuine,
credit the value of the notes in his KYC compliant bank account
in such manner as may be specified by it. However, prior to
                                247
�doing so, the RBI is required to make such verifications as it
may consider necessary for finding out the genuineness of the
reasons for failure to deposit the notes prior to 30th December
2016. The provisions of sub-section (2) of Section 4 of the 2017
Act are somewhat analogous to the provisions in sub-sections
(1) and (2) of Section 8 of the 1973 Act.     Sub-section (3) of
Vivek Narayan Sharma vs Union Of India on 2 January, 2023
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/164842744/
181
Section 4 of the 2017 Act provides that any person, aggrieved by
the refusal of the RBI to credit the value of the notes under sub-
section (2), can make a representation to the Central Board of
the RBI within fourteen days of the communication of such
refusal to him. This provision is somewhat analogous with sub-
section (3) of Section 8 of the 1973 Act.
294. It is thus clear that Section 4 of the 2017 Act provides an
integrated scheme. Sub-section (1) of Section 4 of the 2017 Act
empowers the Central Government to provide a window to the
persons holding SBNs on or before 8th November 2016 to tender
the same within the grace period with such declarations or
statements. Clause (i) thereof is applicable to the citizens who
                                248
�were outside India between 9th November 2016 and 30th
December 2016.          Clause (ii) thereof enables the Central
Government to provide a window to such class of persons and
for such reasons as may be specified in the notification by the
Central Government. Sub-section (2) of Section 4 of the 2017
Act provides for consideration of the cases covered by sub-
section (1) thereof.       It provides that the RBI, upon its
satisfaction, after making such verifications as it may consider
necessary that the reasons for failure to deposit the notes prior
to 30th December 2016, are genuine, will credit the value of the
notes in KYC compliant bank account of such a person. If any
person is aggrieved by the refusal of the RBI under sub-section
(2), an appellate opportunity is provided to such a person,

under sub-section (3).
295. The Constitution Bench of this Court in the case of
Popatlal Shah v. The State of Madras72, observed thus:
72
     [1953] 4 SCR 677
                                249
�             “It is a settled rule of construction that
             to ascertain the legislative intent, all the
             constituent parts of a statute are to be
             taken together and each word, phrase or
             sentence is to be considered in the light
             of the general purpose and object of the
             Act itself.”
296. We may gainfully refer to the following observations of this
Court   in    the   case   of   Peerless   General    Finance   and
Investment Company Limited (supra):
        “33. Interpretation must depend on the
        text and the context. They are the bases of
        interpretation. One may well say if the text
        is the texture, context is what gives the
        colour. Neither can be ignored. Both are
        important. That interpretation is best
        which makes the textual interpretation
        match the contextual. A statute is best
        interpreted when we know why it was
        enacted. With this knowledge, the statute
        must be read, first as a whole and then
        section by section, clause by clause,
        phrase by phrase and word by word. If a
        statute is looked at, in the context of its
        enactment, with the glasses of the statute-
        maker, provided by such context, its
        scheme, the sections, clauses, phrases and
        words may take colour and appear
        different than when the statute is looked at
        without the glasses provided by the
        context. With these glasses we must look

183
                                  250
�        at the Act as a whole and discover what
        each section, each clause, each phrase and
        each word is meant and designed to say as
        to fit into the scheme of the entire Act. No
        part of a statute and no word of a statute
        can be construed in isolation. Statutes
        have to be construed so that every word
        has a place and everything is in its place.
        ….”
297. The interpretation which makes the textual interpretation
match the contextual has to be preferred.      A statute is best
interpreted when the reason and purpose for its enactment is
ascertained.   The statute must be read first as a whole, and
then section by section, clause by clause, phrase by phrase and
word by word. It has been held that if the statute is looked at in
the context of its enactment with the glasses of the statute-
maker, provided by such context, its scheme, the sections,
clauses, phrases and words may take colour and appear
different than when the statute is looked at without the glasses
provided by the context. With these glasses we must look at the
Act as a whole and discover what each section, each clause,
each phrase and each word means and what it is designed to
                               251
�say as to fit into the scheme of the entire Act. No part of a
statute and no word of a statute can be construed in isolation.
298. If we look at the purpose of the 2017 Act, it is for
extinguishing the liabilities of the SBNs which have ceased to be
legal tender with effect from 9th November 2016 so as to give
clarity and finality to the liabilities of the RBI and the Central
Vivek Narayan Sharma vs Union Of India on 2 January, 2023

184
Government arising from such bank notes which have ceased to
be legal tender. However, in order to provide a grace period to
genuine cases, Section 4 of the 2017 Act has been incorporated.
Section 5 of the 2017 Act provides for prohibition on holding,
transferring or receiving SBNs. Sections 6 and 7 of the 2017
Act   are   penal   sections   which   provide   for   penalty   for
contravention of Sections 4 and 5 of the 2017 Act, respectively.
299. It is thus clear that Section 4 of the 2017 Act provides for
an integrated scheme. It is a complete code in itself. Under
sub-section (1) of Section 4 of the 2017 Act, the Central
Government is entitled to provide grace period.        Under sub-
                                252
�section (2) thereof, the RBI is required to satisfy as to whether a
person seeking to take benefit of grace period under sub-section
(1) is entitled thereto after satisfying that the reasons for not
depositing the SBNs prior to 30th December 2016, are genuine,
and thereafter, credit the value of the said notes in his ‘KYC
compliant bank account’. Sub-section (3) thereof provides for
an appeal. We are therefore of the considered view that sub-
section (2) of Section 4 of the 2017 Act cannot be read
independently to provide power to the RBI in isolation of sub-
sections (3) and (4) thereof.   It is to be read as a part of the
scheme of Section 4 of the 2017 Act.
300. Shri Divan and various other learned counsel contended
that there were various genuine cases wherein the persons
could not deposit the demonetized notes within the specified
Vivek Narayan Sharma vs Union Of India on 2 January, 2023
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/164842744/
185
period. The impugned Notification was sought to be challenged
on the ground that it has caused hardship to number of
persons. It was therefore urged that this Court should either
hold the impugned Notification to be arbitrary or direct the
                                253
�Central Government to exercise the powers under Section
4(1)(ii) of the 2017 Act or by exercising the powers under Article
142 of the Constitution of India to provide a window so as to
enable genuine persons to exchange their demonetized notes.
We have already referred to the judgment of this Court in the
case of Km. Sonia Bhatia (supra) hereinbefore.
301. As such, the contention that the impugned notification is
liable to be set aside on the ground that it caused hardship to
individual/citizens will hold no water. The individual interests
must yield to the larger public interest sought to be achieved by
impugned Notification.
302. Insofar as the suggestion to frame a scheme and provide a
window for a limited period so as to enable citizens having
genuine reasons to exchange the notes is concerned, we do not
find that it will be appropriate for us in the absence of any
expertise in economic, monetary and fiscal matters to frame
such a scheme. In our view, it will be encroaching upon the
                               254
�areas reserved for the experts. If the Central Government finds
that there exists any such class of persons and there are any
Vivek Narayan Sharma vs Union Of India on 2 January, 2023
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/164842744/
186
reasons for extending the benefit under Section 4 of the 2017
Act, it is within its discretion to do so. In our view, it cannot be
done by a judicial mandate.
303. We therefore hold that the RBI does not have independent
power under sub-section (2) of Section 4 of the 2017 Act in
isolation of the provisions of Sections 3 and 4(1) thereof to
accept the demonetized notes beyond the period specified in
notifications issued under sub-section (1) of Section 4 of the
2017 Act.
IX.     ANSWERS TO THE QUESTIONS
304. We accordingly answer the Reference as under:
  (i)    The power available to the Central Government under
         sub-section (2) of Section 26 of the RBI Act cannot be
         restricted to mean that it can be exercised only for ‘one’
         or ‘some’ series of bank notes and not for ‘all’ series of
                                255
�        bank notes. The power can be exercised for all series of
        bank notes. Merely because on two earlier occasions,
        the demonetization exercise was by plenary legislation,
        it cannot be held that such a power would not be
        available to the Central Government under sub-section
        (2) of Section 26 of the RBI Act;
(ii)    Sub-section (2) of Section 26 of the RBI Act does not
        provide for excessive delegation inasmuch as there is an
        inbuilt safeguard that such a power has to be exercised
Vivek Narayan Sharma vs Union Of India on 2 January, 2023
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/164842744/
187
        on the recommendation of the Central Board. As such,
        sub-section (2) of Section 26 of the RBI Act is not liable
        to be struck down on the said ground;
(iii)   The impugned Notification dated 8th November 2016
        does not suffer from any flaws in the decision-making
        process;
(iv)    The impugned Notification dated 8th November 2016
        satisfies the test of proportionality and, as such, cannot
        be struck down on the said ground;
                                256
�     (v)    The period provided for exchange of notes vide the
            impugned Notification dated 8th November 2016 cannot
            be said to unreasonable; and
     (vi)   The RBI does not possess independent power under
            sub-section (2) of Section 4 of the 2017 Act in isolation
            of the provisions of Sections 3 and 4(1) thereof to accept
            the demonetized notes beyond the period specified in
            notifications issued under sub-section (1) of Section 4 of
            the 2017 Act.
305. Having answered the Reference, we direct the Registry of
this Court to place the matter before Hon’ble the Chief Justice
of India for placing it before the appropriate Bench(es).
Needless to state that all other contentions are kept open to be
considered by the Bench(es) before which the matters would be

I have had the benefit of reading the judgment proposed by His Lordship, B.R. Gavai, J.
2. However, I wish to differ on the reasoning and conclusions arrived at in his judgement with
regard to exercise of power by the Central Government under sub−section (2) of Section 26 of the
Reserve Bank of India Act, 1934 (hereinafter referred to as “the Act” for the sake of brevity) by
issuance of the impugned notification dated 8th November, 2016.

Hence, my separate judgment.
Preface:
3. By way of a preface, I state that the judgment proposed by His Lordship, Gavai, J. does not
recognise the essential fact that the Act does not envisage initiation of demonetisation of bank notes
by the Central Government. Sub−section (2) of Section 26 of the Act, contemplates demonetisation
of bank notes at the instance of the Central Board of the Reserve Bank of India (hereinafter referred
to as “the Bank”). Hence, if demonetisation is to be initiated by the Central Government, such power
is derived from Entry 36 of List I of the Seventh Schedule to the Constitution which speaks of
currency, coinage and legal tender; foreign exchange.
In view of the interpretation given by me to sub−section (2) of Section 26 of the Act in the context of
the powers of the Central Board of the Bank and the Central Government vis−à−vis demonetisation
of bank notes, my answer is only with regard to question No.1 of the reference order. Incidentally,
while considering the same, I would touch upon question No. 7 of the reference order.
4. The questions for consideration of this Constitution Bench framed by the Predecessor Bench on
16 th December, 2016 are extracted as under:
(i) “Whether the notification dated 8th November 2016 is ultra vires Section 26(2)
and Sections 7,17,23,24,29 and 42 of the Reserve Bank of India Act, 1934;
(ii) Does the notification contravene the provisions of Article 300(A) of the
Constitution;
(iii) Assuming that the notification has been validly issued under the Reserve Bank of
India Act, 1934 whether it is ultra vires Articles 14 and 19 of the Constitution;
(iv) Whether the limit on withdrawal of cash from the funds deposited in bank
accounts has no basis in law and violates Articles 14,19 and 21;
(v) Whether the implementation of the impugned notification(s) suffers from
procedural and/or substantive unreasonableness and thereby violates Articles 14 and
19 and, if so, to what effect?
(vi) In the event that Section 26(2) is held to permit demonetization, does it suffer
from excessive delegation of legislative power thereby rendering it ultra vires the
Constitution;
(vii) What is the scope of judicial review in matters relating to fiscal and economic
policy of the Government;
Vivek Narayan Sharma vs Union Of India on 2 January, 2023
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/164842744/

(viii) Whether a petition by a political party on the issues raised is maintainable
under Article 32; and
(ix) Whether District Co− operative Banks have been discriminated against by
excluding them from accepting deposits and exchanging demonetized notes.”
Keeping in view the general public importance and the far− reaching implications
which the answers to the questions may have, we consider it proper to direct that the
matters be placed before the larger Bench of five Judges for an authoritative
pronouncement. The Registry shall accordingly place the papers before Hon’ble the
Chief Justice for constituting an appropriate Bench.”
5. His Lordship, Gavai, J. has reframed the questions referred to this Constitution Bench and culled
out six questions, which have been answered in the erudite judgment proposed by him. My views on
each of such questions, as contrasted with those of His Lordship’s have been expressed in a tabular
form hereinunder, for easy reference. Question, as reframed His Lordship’s views My views by His

issued              under
subsection (1) of Section
4 of the 2017 Act?"
The reasons for the aforesaid conclusions shall now be discussed.
Controversy in these cases:
6. Practices such as hoarding “black” money, counterfeiting, etc., when coupled with corruption, are
eating into the vitals of our society and economy. Any measure intended to strike at such practices,
and thereby eliminate off shoots thereof, such as, terror funding, drug trafficking, emergence of a
parallel economy, money laundering including Havala transactions, must be commended. Such
measures are necessary to sanitize the economy and society, and enable it to recover from the plague
caused by the evils listed hereinabove. Therefore, it cannot be denied that demonetisation in the
instant case was a well−intentioned proposal. However, in my separate opinion I shall proceed to
legalistically examine whether demonetisation, as well−intentioned as it may have been, was carried
out in accordance with the procedure established under law.
6.1 The controversy in these cases revolves around the exercise of power by the Central Government
under sub− section (2) of Section 26 of the Reserve Bank of India Act, 1934. Sub− section (1) of
Section 26 of the Act provides that every bank note shall be a legal tender as per the amount
expressed therein and shall be guaranteed by the Central Government. However, as per sub− section
(2) of Section 26 of the Act, bank notes can cease to be legal tender when the Central Government
issues a notification in the Gazette of India declaring that with effect from such date as may be
specified in the said notification any series of bank notes of any denomination shall cease to be legal

tender. Such a notification may be issued on the recommendation of the Central Board of the Bank.
There is a challenge to the vires of the said provision and also the validity of the Notification dated
8th November, 2016 issued by the Central Government. As a result of the said Notification, all series
of Rs.500/− and Rs.1,000/− denomination notes were demonetised or ceased to be legal tender by
issuance of a notification on the said date. At this stage itself, it may be mentioned that subsequent
to the notification there was an Ordinance called “The Specified Bank Notes (Cessation of
Liabilities) Ordinance, 2016” (hereinafter referred to as “the 2016 Ordinance” for the sake of
brevity) promulgated by the Hon’ble President of India, which was later made an Act of the
Parliament, namely, “The Specified Bank Notes (Cessation of Liabilities) Act, 2017” (hereinafter
called “2017 Act” for the sake of brevity) and was notified on 1 st March 2017, replacing the
Ordinance. The issuance of the aforesaid Notification and the action of the Central Government of
demonetisation of all series of Rs.500/− and Rs.1,000/− are assailed in these Writ Petitions.
The Reserve Bank of India Act, 1934: An overview
7. Before proceeding further, it would be useful to refer to the provisions of the Act for the sake of
convenience. 7.1 The object and purpose of the Act is to constitute a Reserve Bank of India to
regulate the issue of bank notes and for keeping reserves with a view to secure monetary stability in
India, and to generally operate the currency and credit system of the country to its advantage.
7.2 The Preamble of the Act states that it is essential to have a modern monetary policy framework
to meet the challenge of an increasingly complex economy and the primary objective of the
monetary policy is to maintain price stability while keeping in mind the objective of growth. The
monetary policy framework in India shall be operated by the Reserve Bank of India. 7.3 The
following provisions of the Act are relevant for the purposes of this case and are extracted as under:
“Section 2− Definitions: In this Act, unless there is anything repugnant in the subject or context, −
xxxx [a(ii)] “the Bank” means the Reserve Bank of India constituted by this Act;
[a(iii)] “Bank for International Settlements” mean the body corporate established with the said

signed at the Hague;] [a(iv)] “bank note” means a bank note issued by the Bank, whether in physical
or digital form, under section 22;] xxxxx
(b) “the Central Board” means the Central Board of Directors of the Bank;
xxxx (cc) “International Monetary Fund” and “International Bank for Reconstruction and
Development” means respectively the “International Fund” and the “International Bank”, referred
to in the International Monetary Fund and Bank Act, 1945;] xxxx
(d) “rupee coin” means (***) rupees which are legal tender in India under the provisions of the
Coinage Act, 2011 (11 of 2011)” 7.4 Chapter II of the Act deals with Incorporation, Capital,
Management and Business. Section 3 speaks of establishment and incorporation of the Reserve
Bank while Section 7 deals with Management of the Bank. Section 8 prescribes the composition of

197
the Central Board, and term of office of Directors of the Bank. Section 30 pertains to the powers of
the Central Government to supersede the Central Board of the Bank. 7.5 Chapter III of the Act which
is relevant for the purpose of these cases deals with Central Banking Function. For the purposes of
these cases, Sections 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 26A, 27, 28 and 34 are relevant and the same read as under:
“22. Right to issue Bank notes. −(1) The Bank shall have the sole right to issue Bank
notes in 1[India], and may, for a period which shall be fixed by the [Central
Government] on the recommendation of the Central Board, issue currency notes of
the Government of India supplied to it by the [Central Government], and the
provisions of this Act applicable to Bank notes shall, unless a contrary intention
appears, apply to all currency notes of the Government of India issued either by the
[Central Government] or by the Bank in like manner as if such currency notes were
Bank notes, and references in this Act to Bank notes shall be construed accordingly.
(2) On and from the date on which this Chapter comes into force the 5[Central Government] shall
not issue any currency notes.” “23. Issue Department −  (1) The issue of Bank notes shall be
conducted by the Bank in an Issue Department which shall be separated and kept wholly distinct
from the Banking Department, and the assets of the Issue Department shall not be subject to any
liability other than the liabilities of the Issue Department as hereinafter defined in Section
34. (2) The Issue Department shall not issue Bank notes to the Banking Department or to any other
person except in exchange for other Bank notes or for such coin, bullion or securities as are
permitted by this Act to form part of the Reserve.” “[24. Denominations of notes − (1) Subject to the
provisions of sub−section (2), Bank notes shall be of the denominational values of two rupees, five
rupees, ten rupees, twenty rupees, fifty rupees, one hundred rupees, five hundred rupees, one
thousand rupees, five thousand rupees and ten thousand rupees or of such other denominational
values, not exceeding ten thousand rupees, as the Central Government may, on the recommendation
of the Central Board, specify in this behalf.
(2) The Central Government may, on the recommendation of the Central Board, direct the non−
issue or the discontinuance of issue of Bank notes of such denominational values as it may specify in
this behalf.]” “25. Form of Bank notes − The design, form and material of Bank notes shall be such
as may be approved by the [Central Government] after consideration of the recommendations made
by Central Board.” “26. Legal tender character of notes − (1) Subject to the provisions of sub−section
(2), every Bank note shall be legal tender at any place in [India] in payment or on account for the
amount expressed therein, and shall be guaranteed by the [Central Government].
(2) On recommendation of the Central Board the [Central Government] may, by notification in the
Gazette of India, declare that, with effect from such date as may be specified in the notification, any
series of Bank notes of any denomination shall cease to be legal tender [save at such office or agency
of the Bank and to such extent as may be specified in the notification].” “[26A. Certain Bank notes to
cease to be legal tender− Notwithstanding anything contained in section 26, no Bank note of the
denominational value of five hundred rupees, one thousand rupees or ten thousand rupees issued
before the 13th day of January, 1946, shall be legal tender in payment or on account for the amount

expressed therein.]” “27. Re−issue of notes− The Bank shall not re−issue Bank notes which are torn,
defaced or excessively spoiled.” xxx “34. Liabilities of the Issue Department− (1) The liabilities of the
Issue Department shall be an amount equal to the total of the amount of the currency notes of the
Government of India and Bank notes for the time being in circulation.” 7.6 Section 22 states that the
Bank has the sole right to issue bank notes in India, and may, for a period which shall be fixed by the
Central Government on the recommendation of the Central Board of the Bank, issue currency notes
of the Government of India supplied to it by the Central Government. On and from the date on
which Chapter III comes into force, the Central Government shall not issue any currency notes
except the denomination of Rupee One.
7.7 The issue of bank notes shall be by the Issue Department of the Bank which shall be separated
and kept wholly distinct from the Banking Department, and the assets of the Issue Department shall
not be subject to any liability other than the liability of the Issue Department as defined under
Section 34 of the Act, vide Section 23 of the Act. The liabilities of the Issue Department under
Section 34 of the Act shall be an amount equal to the total of the amount of the currency notes of the
Government of India and bank notes for the time being in circulation.
7.8 Sub−section (1) of Section 24 states that, subject to the provisions of sub−section (2) of Section
24, the bank notes shall be of the denominational values of two rupees, five rupees, ten rupees,
twenty rupees, fifty rupees, one hundred rupees, five hundred rupees, one thousand rupees, five
thousand rupees and ten thousand rupees or of such other denominational values, not exceeding ten
thousand rupees, as the Central Government may, on the recommendation of the Central Board of
the Bank, specify in this behalf. However, this provision is subject to sub−section (2) of Section 24
which states that the Central Government may on the recommendation of the Central Board of the
Bank, direct the non− issue or the discontinuance of issue of bank notes of such denominational
values as it may specify in that behalf. The Central Government has to approve the design for all the
bank notes after consideration of the recommendation made by the Central Board vide Section 25 of
the Act.
7.9 Sub−section (1) of Section 26 of the Act states that every bank note shall be legal tender at any
place in India in payment, or on account for the amount expressed therein and shall be guaranteed
by the Central Government. This is, however, subject to sub−section (2) of Section 26 of the Act,
which states that the Central Government on the recommendation of the Central Board may, by
issuance of a notification in the Gazette of India, declare that with effect from such date as may be
specified in the notification, any series of Bank notes of any denomination shall cease to be legal
tender, save at such office or agency of the Bank and to such extent as may be specified in the
notification. Further discussion on this provision shall be made at a later stage as the said provision
is the centre of the controversy in these cases.
7.10 Pursuant to the demonetisation which was carried out in the year 1946, bank notes of
denominational value of Rs.500/−, Rs.1,000/− and Rs.10,000/−, issued before 13 th January, 1946,
ceased to be legal tender. Section 26A was inserted into the Act pursuant to the demonetisation
which took place in the year 1946, which was initially by an Ordinance and subsequently by an Act
of Parliament. Section 26A was inserted into the Act by Act 62 of 1956, with effect from 01.11.1956.

7.11 Section 27 provides that if a note is torn, defaced or excessively spoiled, the Bank shall not re−
issue such a note. Similarly, Section 28 provides that if a currency note of the Government of India
or bank note is lost, stolen, mutilated or imperfect, the value of same cannot be recovered from the
Central Government or the Bank by any person.
7.12 Section 28A speaks of issue of special bank notes and special one−rupee notes in certain cases.
The said provision was inserted by Act 14 of 1959 with effect from 01.05.1959. Submissions:
8. We have heard learned senior counsel as well as counsel for the petitioners, and the learned
Attorney General for India and learned senior counsel for the respondent− Bank, all assisted by
learned counsel.
8.1 According to the learned senior counsel, Shri P. Chidambaram, appearing for some of the
petitioners, the Central Government has the power to issue a notification in the Gazette of India
declaring any series of bank notes of any denomination as having ceased to be legal tender and
demonetise such currency notes, subject to compliance of certain procedural conditions prescribed
under sub− section (2) of Section 26 of the Act. According to him, first, there has to be a
recommendation of the Central Board of the Bank to the Central Government before the latter can
issue a notification in the Gazette of India, demonetising any series of bank note of any
denomination. That the Central Government cannot, by a simple notification in the Gazette of India,
suo moto and in the absence of any recommendation of the Central Board of the Bank, demonetise
any currency note in circulation by issuance of a gazette notification under the said provision.
8.2 Also, the Central Government can demonetise only a particular series of bank notes of a
particular denomination on the recommendation of the Central Board of the Bank. In other words,
the expression “any” series of bank notes of “any denomination” cannot be understood as “all” series
of bank notes of “all” denominations. That the expression “any” occurring twice in the section must
be given the intended meaning and not supposed meaning and interpretation. 8.3 Shri
Chidambaram submitted that in the instant case, the Central Government without complying with
the procedure envisaged under sub−section (2) of Section 26 of the Act, simply issued a notification
in the Gazette of India on 8 th November, 2016 demonetising all series of bank notes of the
denominations of Rs.500/− and Rs.1,000/−. Consequently, approximately 86 per cent of all notes in
circulation were demonetised. The serious effects of demonetisation are well−known and judicial
notice of the same may be taken. Even otherwise, carrying out the demonetisation by simply issuing
a notification, in the absence of a recommendation made by the Central Board of the Bank, which is
a condition precedent, is unlawful. Further, all series of bank notes of Rs.500/−  and Rs.1,000/−
could not have been demonetised by a stroke of a pen. The expression “any” in sub−section (2) of
Section 26 of the Act means, “a particular” series of “a particular denomination” of a bank note, and
not “all” series of “all” denominations. He contended that in the instant case, the issuance of the
Notification, demonetising the entire currency of Rs.500/−  and Rs.1,000/−  in circulation at the
time, is unlawful and the exercise of power was erroneous and arbitrary and hence, the same ought
to be declared so. 8.4 Learned senior counsel emphasized that sub−section (2) of Section 26 of the
Act must be given an interpretation which is legally workable and practicable and this Court ought
not give a blanket power to the Central Government to demonetise all currency of a particular

200
denomination, as such action would be contrary to the object envisaged under sub−section (2) of
Section 26 of the Act.
8.5 Further elaborating on his submission, learned senior counsel for the petitioners contended that
the expression “any” ought not be interpreted as “all” as such an interpretation would be disastrous
to the Indian economy and contrary to the true letter and spirit of the Act. He contended that the
word “any” means “one of the many” and not “all”. Therefore, according to him, any one series of
bank notes of a denomination could be demonetised and not all series of notes of a particular
denomination or all series of bank notes of all denominations, by issuance of an executive
notification. He contended that if the Section is read down, then, it would be saved from the vice of
unconstitutionality; otherwise, the power of the Central Government to demonetise all series of
bank notes of all denominations would be arbitrary and an excessive power, which is devoid of any
guidance. That such power if vested with the Central Government, would be contrary to the
provisions of the Act. He further contended that exercise of discretion by the Central Government
could be only to the extent of demonetisation of particular series of bank notes of any particular
denomination that too on the recommendation of the Central Board of the Bank. Such vast powers
so as to recommend demonetisation of all series of bank notes of any or all denominations, cannot
also be vested with the Bank. 8.6 Learned senior counsel, Shri Shyam Diwan appearing for the
petitioner, namely, Malvinder Singh in Writ Petition (Civil) No.149 of 2017, submitted that apart
from the guarantee given by the Central Government with regard to every bank note as a legal
tender at any place in India, such notes are also the liabilities of the Issue Department of the Bank
under Section 34 of the Act to the extent of an amount equal to the total of the value of the currency
notes of the Government of India and bank notes for the time being in circulation. 8.7 Learned
senior counsel submitted that in the absence of a specific duty with regard to mitigating the long−
lasting effects of demonetisation on the Indian economy, the decision of the Central Government to
demonetise about 86.4% of the total currency in circulation is vitiated on account of manifest
arbitrariness.
8.8 The learned senior counsel further contended that by applying the test of proportionality, the
impugned notification dated 8 th November, 2016, is liable to be set aside.
8.9 Reliance was placed on K.S. Puttaswamy (Retired) (Aadhaar) vs. Union of India (2019) 1 SCC 1
to contend that the classical equality test can be applied to the present case to come to the
conclusion that the decision of demonetisation had no nexus to the objective sought to be achieved.
8.10 It was further contended that the circular dated 31st December, 2016, is discriminatory, insofar
as it prescribed no upper monetary limit applicable to Resident Indians for submission and
exchange of Specified Bank Notes, which were declared to have ceased to be legal tender; however,
the monetary limit of Rs. 25,000/−  per individual was fixed for Non− Resident Indians (NRIs),
depending on when the notes were taken out of India in accordance with the FEMA Rules. That an
additional liability was imposed on NRIs as they had to produce a certificate issued by the Indian
Customs upon arrival after 30th December, 2016, indicating the import of SBNs and the details and
value of the same.

8.11 The learned senior counsel brought to the Court’s notice an article titled “Using Fast Frequency
Household Survey Data to Estimate the Impact of Demonetisation on Employment” authored by
Mr. Mahesh Vyas, Centre for Monitoring Indian Economy (2018) to contend that owing to the
demonetisation carried out, there was a substantial reduction in employment and employment rates
were 12 million lower than it was two months’ preceding demonetisation. Relying on the said article,
he submitted that demonetisation resulted in a loss of millions of jobs.
9. Per contra, learned Attorney General for India, Shri R.Venkataramani, vehemently countered the
arguments of Shri P.Chidambaram, learned senior counsel, by contending that the power vested
with the Central Government under sub− section (2) of Section 26 of the Act is not arbitrary or
without guidance. That the power to demonetise any currency note or legal tender is vested with the
Central Government and such power is of a wide import and amplitude and this Court may not give
an interpretation, restricting the said power. He contended that the power vested with the Central
Government is exercised by the issuance of a notification in the Gazette of India which is on the
basis of a recommendation of the Central Board of the Bank. 9.1 In this regard, learned Attorney
General emphasized that earlier demonetisations were carried out in the years 1946 and 1978 by
issuance of Ordinances and thereafter, converting the said Ordinances into Acts of Parliament. But
in the instant case, the demonetisation dated 8th November, 2016 was for all series of bank notes of
Rs.500/−  and of Rs.1,000/−  denominations, by the issuance of a gazette notification, which is
perfectly valid in the eyes of law and in accordance with sub−section (2) of Section 26 of the Act.
9.2 Learned Attorney General contended that the impugned gazette notification was issued having
regard to the salient objectives that had to be achieved by the demonetisation of Rs.500/−  and
Rs.1,000/− currency notes which are set out clearly in the notification dated 8th November, 2016.
The salient objectives of demonetisation in the year 2016 were to eradicate black money, to
eliminate fake currency from the Indian economy and to prevent terror funding. He therefore,
contended that there is no merit in the submissions made by the learned senior counsel appearing
for the petitioners as the impugned notification dated 8th November, 2016 is in accordance with
sub−section (2) of Section 26 of the Act and therefore, is valid. 9.3 Shri R.Venkataramani, learned
Attorney General, next submitted that the action taken by way of the impugned notification stands
ratified by the 2017 Act and as the executive action has been validated by the will of the Parliament,
the challenge to the notification would not survive. 9.4 The learned Attorney General contended that
the word “any” appearing before the words “series of bank notes” in sub−section (2) of Section 26 of
the Act should be construed to mean “all”. He submitted that the argument of the petitioners that
the word “any” would not mean “all” is flawed and if the same is accepted, it would permit the
Government to issue separate notifications for each series, however, the Government would be
prohibited from issuing a common notification for all series. 9.5 The learned Attorney General
submitted that the word “any” has been used in two places in sub−section 2 of Section 26 of the Act
and the word “any” preceding the word “series of bank notes” has to be construed to mean “all”
whereas the word “any” preceding the word “denomination” may be construed to be a singular or
otherwise. The learned Attorney General placed reliance on Maharaj Singh vs. State of Uttar
Pradesh (1977) 1 SCC 155 to contend that the same word used in the same provision twice could be
permitted to have a different meaning in each of such usages.

202
9.6 The learned Attorney General contended that the submission made by the petitioners that the
powers under sub− section (2) of Section 26 of the Act have not been exercised in the manner
provided therein and that the decision− making process was flawed on account of patent
arbitrariness, is not tenable. He submitted that sub−section (2) of Section 26 of the Act postulates
that the Central Government may take a decision to carry out demonetisation pursuant to the
recommendation of the Central Board of the Bank and in the present case, there was a
recommendation made by the Central Board to the Central Government, recommending
demonetisation. Thus, after considering the proposal of the Central Board, the Central Government
took the decision to carry out demonetisation. Thus, the procedure as envisaged in sub−section (2)
of Section 26 of the Act was duly complied with.
9.7 The learned Attorney General placed reliance on Bajaj Hindustan Limited vs. Sir Lal Enterprises
Limited (2011) 1 SCC 640 wherein it was observed that economic and fiscal regulatory measures are
fields on which Judges should encroach upon very warily as Judges are not experts in these matters.
The learned Attorney General submitted that the Bank is an expert body charged with the duty of
conceiving and implementing various facets of economic and monetary policy and that there cannot
be a straitjacket formula guiding the discharge of its duties. That therefore, it must be allowed to
carry out its functions as it deems fit. The learned Attorney General further placed reliance on Rajbir
Singh Dalal (Dr.) vs. Chaudhari Devi Lal University, Sirsa (2008) 9 SCC 284 and Secretary and
Curator, Victoria Memorial Hall vs. Howrah Ganatantrik Nagrik Samity (2010) 3 SCC 640 to
contend that it is settled law that the courts should not interfere with the opinion of experts.
9.8 Shri Jaideep Gupta, learned senior counsel for the Bank contended that the withdrawal of all
series of bank notes of the two denominations of Rs.500/−  and Rs.1,000/−  was well within the
jurisdiction and power conferred upon the Bank and the Central Government under sub−section (2)
of Section 26 of the Act and it is incorrect to say that the process under sub−section (2) of Section 26
of the Act had not been followed. Thus, the process cannot be criticized on the ground of procedural
lapse on part of the Bank or the Central Government. 9.9 Learned senior counsel for the Bank
further contended that the submission of the petitioners that unless the phrase “any” in sub−section
(2) of Section 26 of the Act is read as “some” or “one”, the power conferred upon the Bank and the
Central Government under the said section would be unguided and arbitrary, is without any basis. It
was submitted that the expression “any” when construed literally refers to one, several or all of a
total number. Thus, the expression “any” used in sub− section (2) of Section 26 of the Act is broad
enough to include “all”, and consequently, the power of the Government under sub−section (2) of
Section 26 of the Act is not limited merely to a specific set or “series” alone. It was thus contended
that sub− section (2) of Section 26 of the Act is an enabling provision conferring authority on the
Central Government to declare that any series of bank notes of any denomination shall cease to be
legal tender on the recommendation of the Central Board. 9.10 Learned senior counsel for the Bank
also submitted that the decision of the Central Board of the Bank to recommend the measure of
demonetisation and the decision of the Central Government to accept the recommendation cannot
be subject to judicial review. It was further contended that in the sphere of economic policy making,
the Wednesbury principles are of no or little significance and that the proportionality principle can
also not be applied for judicial review of economic policy. Learned senior counsel thus asserted that
it is imperative that no restrictions are placed on economic policies formulated by the Bank or by the
Vivek Narayan Sharma vs Union Of India on 2 January, 2023

203
Central Government. Reliance was placed on Peerless General Finance and Investment Co. Ltd. vs.
Reserve Bank of India (1992) 2 SCC 343 and BALCO Employees’ Union (Regd.) vs. Union of India
(2002) 2 SCC 333 to contend that courts cannot interfere with economic policy which is the function
of experts.
9.11 Learned senior counsel for the Bank further submitted that the contention of the petitioners
that the decision−making process was faulty on account of not following the procedure under sub−
section (2) of Section 26 of the Act, is without substance. Shri Jaideep Gupta, submitted that the
procedure under sub−section (2) of Section 26 contemplates two things i.e., recommendation of the
Central Board, and the decision by the Central Government and that in the present case, both the
requirements have been duly followed, thus, the argument advanced on behalf of the petitioners
does not hold any water. 9.12 Learned senior counsel for the Bank placed reliance on Jayantilal
Ratanchand Shah vs. Reserve Bank of India (1996) 9 SCC 650 to contend that a similar provision
providing for a specified time for exchange of notes was found to be valid by a Constitution Bench of
this Court, while adjudicating on the legality of the 1978 demonetisation. He submitted that the time
provided in the present case is similar to the time provided under the 1978 Act and the time period
provided in the said act was found to be reasonable, having regard to the purpose sought to be
achieved by the said Act. The learned senior counsel further submitted that everybody had sufficient
opportunity either to deposit the notes in their banks or to exchange the same.
9.13 Learned senior counsel for the Bank submitted that demonetisation was carried out in
furtherance of national economic interest and the same ought to be given deference. That the
inconvenience caused to the public cannot be a ground to challenge the validity of such actions,
particularly when prompt and adequate measures were taken by the Bank to mitigate the temporary
hardships expected to be caused. 9.14 Learned senior counsel for the Bank submitted that the
Specified Bank Notes (Cessation of Liabilities) Act, 2017, has given relief to certain categories of
persons subject to verification. It was thus contended that individual cases of hardship that have not
been provided for in the Specified Bank Notes (Cessation of Liabilities) Act, 2017, cannot be gone
into. 9.15 It was further submitted that Section 8 of the RBI Act, 1934, provides for the composition
of the Central Board and sub− section 1 of Section 4 stipulates that the Central Board shall consist of
the following Directors, namely:
i) A Governor and not more than four Deputy Governors to be appointed by the Central
Government;
ii) Four Directors to be nominated by the Central Government, one from each of the four Local
Boards as constituted under Section 9;
iii) Ten Directors to be nominated by the Central Government;
and
iv) Two Government officials to be nominated by the Central Government.

204
It was submitted that the 561 st meeting of the Central Board of the Bank was held on 08.11.2016 at
New Delhi and business was transacted therein with the requisite quorum. That during the said
meeting, apart from the then Governor and two Deputy Governors, one Director nominated under
Section 8(1)(b) of the Act, two Directors nominated under Section 8(1)(c) of the Act and two
Directors nominated under Section 8(1)(d) of the Act were present. Thus, the requisite quorum of
four directors of whom not less than three directors nominated under Section 8(1)(b) or 8(1)(c) were
present for the meeting. Thus, the requisite procedure was duly followed by the Bank in the conduct
of the 561st meeting of the Central Board.
Other learned senior counsel as well as learned counsel and parties−in−person have also addressed
the Court. History and instances of Demonetisation:
10. Before proceeding to consider the rival contentions, it would be useful to delineate on the
concept of demonetisation and how it has been carried out, the world over as well as in India. 10.1 In
prosaic terms, demonetisation is the process by which a nation’s economic unit of exchange loses its
legally enforceable validity. Currencies that are terminated through the process of demonetisation
are no more legally considered exchanges and have no financial value. Demonetisation is therefore,
the process of eliminating the lawful acceptance status of a monetary unit, by withdrawal of certain
kinds or denominations of existing currency from circulation. The currency withdrawn may be
supplanted with new currency.
10.2 The French were the first to use the term “Demonetise” in the years between the years 1850−
1855. In world history, one can see several instances of demonetisations as many countries have
adopted the policy of demonetisation. Some instances of demonetisation globally, may be recorded
as under:
a) United States of America: One of the oldest examples of demonetisation may be found in the
United States, when the Coinage Act of 1873, ordered the elimination of silver as legal tender in
favour of the gold standard. Again, in the year 1969, to combat the existence of black money in the
country and to restore the country’s economy, President Richard Nixon declared all currencies over
$100 to be null.
b) Britain: Before the year 1971, the currency of pound and penny used to be in circulation in Britain
but to bring uniformity in currency, the government stopped circulation of old currency in 1971, and
introduced coins of 5 and 10 pounds.
c) Congo: Mobutu Sese Seko made some changes with respect to the currency in circulation in
Congo, for the smooth running of its economy during the Nineties.
d) Ghana: In the year 1982, Ghana demonetised notes of 50 Cedis denomination to tackle tax
evasion and empty excess liquidity.
e) Nigeria: Demonetisation was carried out during the government of Muhammadu Buhari in the
year 1984, when Nigeria introduced new currency and banned old notes.

Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/164842744/
205
f) Myanmar: In the year 1987, Myanmar’s military invalidated around 80% of the value of money to
curb black marketing.
g) Russia (formerly U.S.S.R): In the year 1991, in an attempt to combat the parallel economy, 50 and
100 Ruble notes were removed from circulation under the leadership of Mikhail Gorbachev.
h) Venezuela: In the year 2016, the Government of Venezuela demonetised 100 Bolívares notes on
11th December, 2016, to achieve economic, monetary and price stability.
i) Zimbabwe: In 2015, the Zimbabwean government chose to replace the Zimbabwe Dollar with the
US Dollar in order to stabilize hyperinflation.
History of Demonetisation in India:
j) The first demonetisation was carried out on 12 th January, 1946. To bring to
realisation the first demonetisation that the country witnessed, an Ordinance was
promulgated by the Government on 12th January, 1946. The Ordinance demonetised
currency notes of Rs.500/−, Rs.1,000/− and Rs.10,000/− which were in circulation,
primarily to check the unaccounted hoarding of money, with a directive that they
could be exchanged for re− issued bank notes, within ten days. The period of
exchange was extended a number of times by both, the Bank and the Central
Government. By the end of 1947, out of a total of Rs.143.97 crores of high
denomination notes, notes of the value of Rs.134.9 crores had been exchanged. Thus,
notes worth Rs.9.07 crores went out of circulation or not exchanged.
It is said that this exercise turned out to be more like a currency conversion drive as
the government couldn’t achieve much profit in the cash−strapped economy at that
time.
k) The second demonetisation was carried out in the year 1978, in pursuance of the
recommendation of the Wanchoo Committee, appointed by the Central Government, to recall the
re−introduced Rs.1,000/−, Rs.5,000/− and Rs.10,000/− notes, entirely from the cash system. The
stated objective of such measure was to nullify black money supposedly held in high denomination
currency notes. The government resorted to demonetisation of bank notes of denominations
Rs.1,000/− , Rs.5,000/− , and Rs.10,000/−  notes on 16 th January, 1978, under the High
Denomination Bank Notes (Demonetisation) Ordinance, 1978 (No. 1 of 1978) and people were
allowed three days’ time to exchange their notes. During this demonetisation exercise, out of a value
of Rs.146 Crores demonetised notes, currency notes of value of Rs.124.45 Crores were exchanged
and a sum of Rs.21.55 Crores, or 14.76% of the demonetised currency notes, were extinguished.
11. It would be useful at this stage to discuss briefly the Acts of 1946 and 1978 and the impugned
demonetisation having regard to sub− section (2) of Section 26 of the Act.
Vivek Narayan Sharma vs Union Of India on 2 January, 2023
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/164842744/
206
11.1 The Ordinance of 12th January, 1946 stated that on the expiry of the 12th Day of January, 1946,
all high denomination bank notes shall, notwithstanding anything contained in Section 26 of the
Act, cease to be legal tender in payment or on account at any place in British India. A provision was
made for the exchange of the high denomination bank notes which had ceased to be legal tender,
with bank notes of the denominational value of Rs.100/− which continued to be legal tender.
11.2 The High Denomination Bank Notes (Demonetisation) Act, 1978 was enacted in public interest
and provided demonetisation of certain high denomination bank notes and for matters connected
therewith or incidental thereto. The said Act, inter− alia, defined a high denomination bank note to
be a bank note of the denominational value of Rs.1,000/−, Rs.5,000/− or Rs.10,000/−, issued by
the Reserve Bank of India immediately before the commencement of the said Act. The said Act also
stated in Section 3 that on the expiry of the 16 th Day of January, 1978, all high denomination bank
notes shall, notwithstanding anything contained in Section 26 of the Act, cease to be legal tender.
11.3 As noted earlier, the previous demonetisations were not carried out on the strength of sub−
section (2) of Section 26 of the Act inasmuch as both the legislations categorically stated that the
demonetisation was “notwithstanding anything contained in Section 26 of the Act”. In fact, under
the 1978 Act, one of the objects of the demonetisation of high denomination bank notes was that
such notes facilitated illicit transfer of money for financial transactions which were harmful to the
national economy or were used for illegal purposes and therefore, it was necessary in public interest
to demonetise the high denomination bank notes. The use of the non− obstante clause clearly
indicates that the Central Government was not demonetising the currency on the recommendation
of the Central Board of the Bank under sub−section (2) of Section 26 of the Act. In fact, this position
is demonstrated by the fact that in the year 1978, the then Central Government sought an opinion of
the Central Board of the Bank regarding the demonetisation of high denomination bank notes. The
proposal for demonetisation arose from or was initiated by the Central Government which sought
the opinion of the Central Board of the Bank. Therefore, the proposal for demonetisation initiated
by the Central Government was de hors sub−section (2) of Section 26 of the Act.
11.4 The fact that the non−obstante clause found a place in Section 3 of the Ordinance of 1946 as
well as in Section 3 of the 1978 Act, would clearly indicate that the Central Government, in those
cases, did not demonetise the high denomination bank notes on the recommendation made by the
Central Board of the Bank under sub−section (2) of Section 26 of the Act but on the other hand, the
same was carried out de hors the said provision by plenary legislations. Hence, the Central
Government which initiated the process chose the route through legislation for carrying out the
demonetisation rather than by issuing an executive notification in the Gazette of India. 11.5 The
above is in contrast with the issuance of the gazette notification dated 8th November, 2016, which
was followed by the Ordinance of 2016 and then the Act of 2017 was enacted. The said Act, inter alia,
provides that the specified bank notes would cease to be the liability of the Reserve Bank of India or
the Central Government.
11.6 The demonetisation carried out in the year 2016, of all series of bank notes of denomination
Rs.500/− and Rs.1,000/− which forms the subject matter of the controversy at hand was, on the
other hand, carried out by the Central Government by issuance of a notification in the Gazette of

207
India on 8 th November, 2016. For ease of reference, the impugned notification dated 8 th
November, 2016 is extracted as under:
“MINISTRY OF FINANCE (Department of Economic Affairs) NOTIFICATION New
Delhi, the 8th November, 2016 S.O. 3407(E). — Whereas, the Central Board of
Directors of the Reserve Bank of India (hereinafter referred to as the Board) has
recommended that bank notes of denominations of the existing series of the value of
five hundred rupees and one thousand rupees (hereinafter referred to as specified
bank notes) shall be ceased to be legal tender;
And whereas, it has been found that fake currency notes of the specified bank notes
have been largely in circulation and it has been found to be difficult to easily identify
genuine bank notes from the fake ones and that the use of fake currency notes is
causing adverse effect to the economy of the country;
And whereas, it has been found that high denomination bank notes are used for storage of
unaccounted wealth as has been evident from the large cash recoveries made by law enforcement
agencies;
And whereas, it has also been found that fake currency is being used for financing subversive
activities such as drug trafficking and terrorism, causing damage to the economy and security of the
country and the Central Government after due consideration has decided to implement the
recommendations of the Board;
Now, therefore, in exercise of the powers conferred by sub−section (2) of section 26 of the Reserve
Bank of India Act, 1934 (2 of 1934) (hereinafter referred to as the said Act), the Central Government

[F.No.10/03/2016−Cy.I] Dr. SAURABH GARG, Jt. Secy.” (underlining by me) The said Notification
was thereafter followed by an Ordinance issued by the President on 30th December, 2016 and
subsequently an Act of Parliament namely, the 2017 Act.
The Actual Controversy:
12. The contention of the leaned senior counsel for the petitioners is two− fold: firstly, that sub−
section (2) of Section 26 of the Act cannot be interpreted as having a very wide import as it would
then be lacking in guidance and being unchanneled, would be arbitrary and in violation of Article 14,
and hence, unconstitutional. It was further contended that if the provision has to be saved from
being declared unconstitutional, then the same has to be “read down” which means that a restrictive
interpretation must be given to the words of the provision. The second contention is with regard to
the exercise of power by the Central Government by issuance of the Notification dated 8th
November, 2016 and the manner in which such power was exercised and the procedure followed.
The aforesaid two contentions shall be dealt with together as they are intertwined. The Reserve
Bank of India: Bulwark of the Indian Economy:

13. Before considering the aforesaid two contentions, it would be useful to discuss the unique
position that the Reserve Bank of India holds in the Indian economy.
13.1 Shri Chidambaram cited a recent judgment of this Court in the case of Internet & Mobile Assn.
of India vs. RBI (2020) 10 SCC 274 (“Internet and Mobile Assn. of India”) wherein one of us, V.
Ramasubramanian, J. while dealing with the regulation of crypto−currency and virtual currency
(VC) highlighted the importance of the Reserve Bank of India in the Indian economy. The salient
observations made in the said judgment may be culled out as under:
a) That the Bank, established for the objects spelt out under Section 3(1) of the Act, is vested with
the duty to operate the monetary policy framework in India; take over the management of currency
from the Central Government and carry on the business of banking, in accordance with the
provisions of the Act.
b) That with a view to enable the Bank to perform the role spelt out above, the Act authorises it to
carry on and transact businesses, as enlisted under Section 17 of the Act; confers under Section 22,
sole and exclusive right on the Bank to issue bank notes in India, except in relation to notes of
denomination, Rs.1; recognises under Section 26 (1) that every note issued by the Bank shall be a
legal tender; vests with the Central Board of the Bank the power to recommend to the Central
Government to declare any series of Bank notes of any denomination, to cease to be legal tender,
under Section 26 (2) of the Act; prohibits under Section 38 any money from being put into
circulation by the Central Government, except through the Bank. In short, it was held that the
operation/regulation of the credit/financial system of the country rests, almost entirely, on the
Bank.
c) That the Bank is the sole repository of power for the management of currency in India. As regards
the nature, amplitude and inalienability of the power that the Bank wields in the field of currency
management, it was observed that what the Bank can do in this regard, the executive acting de−hors
the aid of the Bank, is not adequately equipped to do. Recognising the importance of the role played
by the Bank in matters pertaining to currency management, this Court declared that any
observations/recommendations made by the Bank to the Central Government in this regard, have to
be accorded due deference. The pertinent observations of the Court on this aspect have been usefully
extracted hereinunder:
“192. But as we have pointed out above, RBI is not just any other statutory authority.
It is not like a stream which cannot be greater than the source.
The RBI Act, 1934 is a pre−constitutional legislation, which survived the Constitution by virtue of
Article 372(1) of the Constitution. The difference between other statutory creatures and RBI is that
what the statutory creatures can do, could as well be done by the executive. The power conferred
upon the delegate in other statutes can be tinkered with, amended or even withdrawn. But the
power conferred upon RBI under Section 3(1) of the RBI Act, 1934 to take over the management of
the currency from the Central Government, cannot be taken away. The sole right to issue Bank notes
in India, conferred by Section 22(1) cannot also be taken away and conferred upon any other Bank
Vivek Narayan Sharma vs Union Of India on 2 January, 2023

211
or authority. RBI by virtue of its authority, is a member of the Bank of International Settlements,
which position cannot be taken over by the Central Government and conferred upon any other
authority. Therefore, to say that it is just like any other statutory authority whose decisions cannot
invite due deference, is to do violence to the scheme of the Act. In fact, all countries have Central
Banks/authorities, which, technically have independence from the Government of the country. To
ensure such independence, a fixed tenure is granted to the Board of Governors, so that they are not
bogged down by political expediencies. In the United States of America, the Chairman of the Federal
Reserve is the second most powerful person next only to the President. Though the President
appoints the seven−member Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve, in consultation with the
Senate, each of them is appointed for a fixed tenure of fourteen years. Only one among those seven
is appointed as Chairman for a period of four years. As a result of the fixed tenure of 14 years, all the
members of Board of Governors survive in office more than three Governments. Even the European
Central Bank headquartered in Frankfurt has a President, Vice− President and four members,
appointed for a period of eight years in consultation with the European Parliament. Worldwide,
central authorities/Banks are ensured an independence, but unfortunately Section 8(4) of the RBI
Act, 1934 gives a tenure not exceeding five years, as the Central Government may fix at the time of
appointment. Though the shorter tenure and the choice given to the Central Government to fix the
tenure, to some extent, undermines the ability of the incumbents of office to be absolutely
independent, the statutory scheme nevertheless provides for independence to the institution as
such. Therefore, we do not accept the argument that a policy decision taken by RBI does not warrant
any deference.”
d) This Court acknowledged the pivotal position of the Bank in the economy of the country. That the
powers of the Bank, may be exercised by way of preventive as well as curative measures. That such
powers may be exercised to take pre−  emptive action. However, such measures must be
proportional and must be prompted by some semblance of any damage suffered by its regulated
entities. The relevant observations have been reproduced as under:
“224. It is no doubt true that RBI has very wide powers not only in view of the
statutory scheme of the three enactments indicated earlier, but also in view of the
special place and role that it has in the economy of the country. These powers can be
exercised both in the form of preventive as well as curative measures. But the
availability of power is different from the manner and extent to which it can be
exercised. While we have recognised elsewhere in this order, the power of RBI to take
a pre−emptive action, we are testing in this part of the order the proportionality of
such measure, for the determination of which RBI needs to show at least some
semblance of any damage suffered by its regulated entities. But there is none. When
the consistent stand of RBI is that they have not banned VCs and when the
Government of India is unable to take a call despite several committees coming up
with several proposals including two draft Bills, both of which advocated exactly
opposite positions, it is not possible for us to hold that the impugned measure is
proportionate.” 13.2 Shri Jaideep Gupta appearing for the Bank has brought to our
notice the following decisions to emphasize on the importance of the Reserve Bank of
India:
Vivek Narayan Sharma vs Union Of India on 2 January, 2023
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/164842744/
212
a) In Joseph Kuruvilla Vellukunnel vs. The Reserve Bank of India AIR 1962 SC 1371, this Court
observed that the most important function of the Bank is to regulate the banking system. The Bank
has been described as a Banker's Bank. Under the Act, the scheduled banks maintain certain
balances and the Bank can lend assistance to those banks as a “lender of the last resort”. The Bank
has also been given certain advisory and regulatory functions, but in its position as a central bank, it
acts as an agency for collecting financial information and statistics. The Bank is also entrusted with
the role of advising the Government and other banks on financial and banking matters, and for this
purpose, the Bank keeps itself informed of the activities and monetary position of scheduled and
other banks and inspects the books and accounts of Scheduled banks and advises the Government
after inspection of the said books and accounts as to whether a particular bank should be included in
the Second Schedule or not. That the Bank has been created as a central bank with powers of
supervision, advice and inspection, over banks, particularly those desiring to be included in the
Second Schedule or those already included in the Schedule. The Reserve Bank thus, safeguards the
economy and the financial stability of the country. This Court in the said case also sounded a caveat
in stating that it cannot be said that the Reserve Bank can never act mistakenly or even negligently.
b) Subsequently, in Peerless General Finance and Investment Co. Ltd. vs. Reserve Bank of India
(1992) 2 SCC 343 this Court once again recognized the status of the Reserve Bank in the Indian
economy. In the said case it was observed that the Reserve Bank of India is a Banker’s Bank and a
creature of statute. That the Reserve Bank of India has a large contingent of expert advice relating to
the matters affecting the economy of the entire country. It was further observed that the Reserve
Bank has an important role in the economy and financial affairs of India and one of its many
important functions is to regulate the banking system in the country.
The aforesaid discussion is relevant for the purpose of interpreting sub−section (2) of Section 26 of
the Act. The said provision clearly states that it is only on the recommendation of the Central Board
of the Bank, that any series of bank notes of any denomination shall be declared to have ceased to be
legal tender.
Economic/Fiscal Policies: Interference by Courts 13.3 Before proceeding to interpret the said
provision, it would be necessary to consider another aspect of the matter which has been
emphasized by the learned Attorney General, i.e., with regard to the Court’s deference to the
economic and monetary policies of the government and restraint that the Court must exercise in
interfering with the said policies, unless the same are so irrational or unreasonable, so as to be
declared to be unconstitutional.
The above submission was made in the context of the contention of the petitioners, that the
decision−making process in the present case was deeply flawed as it was contrary to the scheme and
procedure contained in sub−section (2) of Section 26 of the Act and hence, this Court may review
the same and declare it to be in contravention, inter− alia, of statutory provisions of the Act. The
aforesaid contention was vehemently opposed by learned Attorney General who submitted that
courts cannot sit in judgment over economic policy matters of the Government. In this regard the
following discussions could be made.

213
Judicial Review of Economic Policy:
The Indian judiciary has consistently exercised restraint with regard to judicial review of policy
decisions. A few instances on which such restraint has been demonstrated, have been discussed as
under:
(a) In this regard reliance was placed by the learned Attorney General on a judgment of this Court in
State of Tamil Nadu vs. National South Indian River Interlinking Agriculturist Association 2021 SCC
OnLine SC 1114.
(b) In Rustom Cavasjee Cooper vs. Union of India AIR 1970 SC 565 (“Bank Nationalization Case”) it
was observed that this Court was not the forum where conflicting policy claims may be debated; it is
only required to adjudicate the legality of a measure which has little to do with relative merits of
different political and economic theories.
(c) This Court in the case of State of M.P. vs. Nandlal Jaiswal (1986) 4 SCC 566 observed that the
Government, as laid down in Permian Basin Area Rate Cases, 20 L Ed (2d) 312, is entitled to make
pragmatic adjustments which may be called for by particular circumstances. The court cannot strike
down a policy decision taken by the Government merely because it feels that another policy decision
would have been fairer or wiser or more scientific or logical. That courts could interfere only if the
policy decision is patently arbitrary, discriminatory or mala fide.
(d) In Peerless General Finance and Investment Co. Ltd. vs. RBI (1992) 2 SCC 343, this Court
dithered to indulge itself with matters involving domains of the executive and the legislature
concerning economic policy or directions given by Reserve Bank of India. This Court observed that
it is unbecoming of judicial institutions to interfere with economic policy which is the prerogative of
the Government, in consultation with experts in the field and that it is not the function of the courts
to sit in judgment over matters of economic policy and it must necessarily be left to the expert
bodies.
(e) The validity of the decision of the Government to grant licence under the Telegraph Act, 1885 to
non− government companies for establishing, maintaining and working of telecommunication
system of the country pursuant to government policy of privatisation of telecommunications was
challenged in Delhi Science Forum vs. Union of India AIR 1996 SC 1356. It was contended that
telecommunications were a sensitive service which should always be within the exclusive domain
and control of the Central Government and under no situation should be parted with by way of grant
of license to non−government companies and private bodies. While rejecting this contention, this
Court observed that:
“... The national policies in respect of economy, finance, communications, trade,
telecommunications and others have to be decided by Parliament and the
representatives of the people on the floor of Parliament can challenge and question
any such policy adopted by the ruling Government....”
Vivek Narayan Sharma vs Union Of India on 2 January, 2023
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/164842744/
214
(f) The reluctance of the court to judicially examine the merits of economic policy was
again emphasised in Bhavesh D.
Parish vs. Union and India (2000) 5 SCC 471. This Court opined that in the context of the changed
economic scenario the expertise of people dealing with the subject should not be lightly interfered
with. The consequences of such an interdiction can have large−scale ramifications and can put the
clock back for a number of years. That in dealing with economic legislations, this Court, while not
jettisoning its jurisdiction to curb arbitrary action or unconstitutional legislation, should interfere
only in those few cases where the view reflected in the legislation is not possible to be taken at all.
(g) Buttressing the same aspect, in Balco Employees’ Union (Regd) vs. Union of India AIR 2002 SC
350, it was held that in a democracy, it is the prerogative of each elected Government to follow its
own policy. This Court observed that often a change in Government may result in the shift in focus
or change in economic policies and any such change may result in adversely affecting some vested
interests. Unless any illegality is committed in the execution of the policy or the same is contrary to
law or malafide, a decision bringing about change cannot per se be interfered with by the court.
(h) In Directorate of Film Festivals vs. Gaurav Ashwin Jain AIR 2007 SC 1640, it was observed that
the scope of judicial review of governmental policy is now well defined and the courts do not and
cannot act as Appellate Authorities examining the correctness, suitability and appropriateness of a
policy. This Court was also of the view that Courts are not Advisors to the executive on matters of
policy which the executive is entitled to formulate, thus, the scope of judicial review when examining
a policy of the government is to check whether it violates the fundamental rights of the citizens or is
opposed to the provisions of the Constitution, or opposed to any statutory provision or manifestly
arbitrary. It was thus held that the Courts cannot interfere with policy either on the ground that it is
erroneous or on the ground that a better, fairer or wiser alternative is available. Legality of the
policy, and not the wisdom or soundness of the policy, is the subject of judicial review.
(i) In the case of DDA vs. Joint Action Committee, Allottee of SFS Flats AIR 2008 SC 1343, the
Supreme Court held as under:
“An executive order termed as a policy decision is not beyond the pale of judicial review. Whereas
the superior courts may not interfere with the nitty− gritty of the policy, or substitute one by the
other but it will not be correct to contend that the court shall lay its judicial hands off, when a plea is
raised that the impugned decision is a policy decision. Interference therewith on the part of the
superior court would not be without jurisdiction as it is subject to judicial review.” “Broadly, a policy
decision is subject to judicial review on the following grounds:
(a) if it is unconstitutional;
(b) if it is dehors the provisions of the Act and the regulations;
(c) if the delegate has acted beyond its power of delegation;
Vivek Narayan Sharma vs Union Of India on 2 January, 2023

215
(d) if the executive policy is contrary to the statutory or a larger policy.”
(j) In Small Scale Industrial Manufacturers Association (Regd.) vs. Union of India (2021) 8 SCC 511,
a writ petition was preferred under Article 32 of the Constitution of India by the Small− Scale
Industrial Manufactures Association, Haryana for an appropriate writ, direction or order directing
the Union of India and others to take effective and remedial measures to redress the financial strain
faced by the industrial sector, particularly, MSMEs due to the COVID− 19 pandemic. This Court
while considering the submissions of the parties on the issue of whether economic and/or policy
decisions taken by the Government in their executive capacity are amenable to the jurisdiction of
courts, held that it was the legality of the policy, and not the wisdom or soundness of the policy, that
can be the subject of judicial review. This Court observed that courts do not play an advisory role to
Government and economic policy decisions should be left to experts. This Court observed that it is
not normally within the domain of any Court to weigh the pros and cons of the policy or to scrutinize
it and test the degree of its beneficial or equitable disposition for the purpose of varying, modifying
or annulling it, based on howsoever sound and good reasoning. It is only when a policy is arbitrary
and violative of any Constitutional, statutory or any other provisions of law, that the Courts can
interfere.
13.4 What emerges from an understanding of the decisions referred to above on the subject of
judicial review of economic policy may be culled out as under:
i) That the court is not to sit in judgment over the merits of economic or financial policy;
ii) That the scope of interference by a court is limited to instances where the impugned scheme or
legislation in the economic arena has been enacted in violation of any Constitutional or statutory
provisions;
iii) That the court may not undertake a foray into the merits, demerits, sufficiency or lack thereof,
success in realising the objectives etc., of an economic policy, as such an analysis is the prerogative
of the Government in consultation with experts in the field.
13.5 Being mindful of the limited scope of judicial review permissible in matters concerning
economic policy decisions, I shall limit my examination of the matter to such extent as is necessary
for the purpose of determining whether the process concluding in the issuance of the impugned
notification was correct or as being contrary to sub−section (2) of Section 26 of the Act and allied
aspects of the case. It may be stated at this juncture that the said aspect of the matter is not one of
form but of substance. Therefore, examining this aspect of the matter would not amount to
interfering with, or sitting in judgment over the merits of the policy of demonetisation, and is
therefore well within the limits of the Lakshmanrekha that this Court has carefully drawn for itself.
14. Bearing in mind the important role played by the Bank in shaping the economy of the country,
and also the principle that the Constitutional Courts should refrain from interfering in financial and
economic policy decisions of the government unless such policies are so irrational as to warrant
interference and also having regard to the provisions of the Constitution, the relevant statutes, and

considerations of public interest, the two contentions raised by the petitioners shall now be
considered in analysing and interpreting Section 26 (2) of the Act.

conclusions has been expressed in a tabular form as under:

                                                            originates    from      the
                                                            Central Government.
15.1      Section 26 of the Act deals with legal tender of notes. Sub−
section (1) of Section 26 declares that every bank note shall be a legal tender at any place in India in
payment or on account for the amount expressed therein, and shall be guaranteed by the Central
Government. There are two aspects to this provision: the first is, every bank note shall be a legal
tender in any place in India and, secondly, that the Central Government shall guarantee the amount
expressed on the bank note. The expression “bank note” is defined in Section 2 (aiv) of the Act to
mean, a bank note issued by the Bank whether in physical or digital form, under Section 22 of the
Act. Section 22 of the Act categorically states that the Bank has the sole right to issue bank notes in
India, on the recommendations of the Central Board of the Bank. The provision further provides
that the Bank has the sole right to issue currency notes of the Government of India. The provisions
of the Act would be applicable in a like manner, to all currency notes of the Government of India,
issued either by the Central Government or by the Bank, as if such currency notes were bank notes.
15.2 Further, it is only on the recommendation of the Central Board of the Bank that the Central
Government may direct the non−  issue or discontinuation of the issue of bank notes of such
denominational value as it may specify in this behalf. Even the design, form and material of bank
notes has to be approved by the Central Government, after considering the recommendations made
by the Central Board of the Bank. Thus, the scheme of the Act envisages that the issuance of the
bank notes, the various denominations of the bank notes, the design and form of the bank notes, are
all to be specified by the Central Government only on the recommendation of the Central Board of
Vivek Narayan Sharma vs Union Of India on 2 January, 2023

219
the Bank. Therefore, on perusal of Sections 24, 25 and 26 of the Act, it is observed that it is only on
the recommendation of the Central Board of the Bank that the Central Government would act qua
the aforestated matters, on the strength of the respective provisions. It need not be emphasised that
the Bank, being the only institution, which carries out the function of currency management and
formulates credit rules in the country, is recognised as having a say in the issuance of currency
notes, and also in specifying the denominations of the notes, as well as the design and form of the
bank notes.
15.3 Further, although, sub−section (1) of Section 26 states that every Bank note shall be legal tender
at any place in India, it acquires legal sanctity because the Central Government has guaranteed the
bank note which has legal tender. Thus, a bank note statutorily has dual characteristics when it is
issued by the Bank, namely, being a legal tender coupled with the guarantee of the Central
Government and the said qualities go hand in hand. This would mean that it is only when the Bank
which has the sole right to issue a currency note in India, issues the note and the same has been
guaranteed by the Central Government, that such a note is legal tender. Therefore, the Issue
Department of the Bank is not subject to any liabilities other than the liabilities under Section 34 of
the Act. Section 34 of the Act states that an amount equal to the total of the amount of the currency
notes of the Government of India and bank notes for the time being in circulation, would be the
liability of the Issue Department. This would imply that as long as the bank notes issued by the Bank
are in circulation, the liability of the Government of India would continue. The said liability is owing
to the guarantee given by the Central Government in sub− section (1) of Section 26 which is in the
nature of a statutory guarantee.
15.4 While considering sub−section (1) of Section 26 of the Act, the first question that would arise is,
whether, a bank note which has ceased to be a legal tender on the issuance of a notification by the
Central Government would also cease to have the guarantee of the Central Government. In other
words, whether the guarantee by the Central Government, would continue despite the bank note
ceasing to be a legal tender. The answer is in the affirmative, for, a bank note may cease to be a legal
tender between citizens but cannot cease to have the guarantee of the Central Government, so long
as the liability of the Issue Department continues. The liability of the Issue Department of the Bank
is co−extensive with the time period within which a bank note which has ceased to be a legal tender
is exchanged at a notified bank. It is because of this reason that a bank note of any denomination
which is demonetised or is declared to have ceased to be a legal tender, can be exchanged as
indicated in the notification issued by the Central Government so that the bearer of the bank note
receives an equivalent amount as that expressed in the note which has ceased to be a legal tender or
demonetised. Therefore, even though such demonetised currency would cease to be legal tender, the
same could be exchanged in a bank specified by the Reserve Bank owing to the guarantee of the
Central Government. If the guarantee of the Central Government ceases on demonetisation, then
the same cannot be exchanged by the bearer of such bank notes. This has also been the argument of
learned senior counsel Shri Shyam Divan.
15.5 Sub−section (2) of Section 26 of the Act states that on the recommendation of the Central Board
of the Bank, the Central Government may, by notification in the Gazette of India, declare that with
effect from such date as specified in the notification, any series of bank notes of any denomination
Vivek Narayan Sharma vs Union Of India on 2 January, 2023
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/164842744/
220
shall cease to be a legal tender, save at such office or agency of the Bank and to such extent as may
be specified in the said notification. The Central Government derives the power to issue a
notification in the Gazette only on the recommendation of the Central Board of the Bank. The
issuance of such a notification is an executive act which is backed by the recommendation of the
Central Board of the Bank which has been accepted by the Central Government. The notification has
to indicate the date from which any series of bank notes of any denomination shall cease to be a
legal tender, save at such office and to such extent as may be specified in the notification.
15.6 The essential ingredients of sub−section (2) of Section 26 of the Act can be epitomised as under:
i) on the recommendation of the Central Board of the Bank;
ii) the Central Government by notification in the Gazette of India;
iii) may declare any series of bank notes of any denomination to cease to be legal tender;
iv) with effect from such date as may be specified in the notification;
v) to such extent as may be specified in the notification;
Therefore, under sub−section (2) of Section 26 of the Act, the Central Government would act only on
the recommendation made by the Central Board of the Bank, which is the initiator of
demonetisation of bank notes. 15.7 Learned Attorney General made a pertinent submission that it is
not necessary that only on a recommendation of the Central Board of the Bank, the Central
Government can demonetise any currency. That the Central Government has the power or
jurisdiction to demonetise any bank note by the issuance of a gazette notification. He further
contended that the powers of the Central Government cannot be denuded to such an extent that
unless and until a recommendation of the Central Board of the Bank is made to the Central
Government, the latter cannot demonetise any currency. According to learned Attorney General, if
such a strict interpretation is given to sub−section (2) of Section 26, it would nullify the power of the
Central Government to demonetise any bank note, having regard to the economic conditions of the
country, the financial health of the economy and the monetary policy of the Government. It was
submitted that the provision must be so interpreted so as to give a free play in the joints and
empower the Central Government to issue a notification in the Gazette of India, in order to
demonetise any bank note. He further contended that the requirement of recommendation of the
Central Board of the Bank in order to enable the Central Government to issue a notification to
demonetise any currency would imply that the initiation of demonetisation must only be from the
Central Board of the Bank and that the Central Government has no power to initiate such an action
of demonetisation. 15.8 I find considerable force in the contention of the learned Attorney General
inasmuch as the Central Government cannot be said to be without powers in initiating
demonetisation of bank notes. This is on the strength of Entry 36 of List I of the Seventh Schedule of
the Constitution. The Central Government is not just concerned with the financial health of the
country as well as its economy, but it is also concerned with the sovereignty and integrity of India;
the security of the State; the defence of the country; its friendly relations with foreign countries;

221
internal and external security and various other aspects of governance. On the other hand, the Bank
is only concerned with the regulation of currency notes, monetary policy framework, maintaining
price stability and allied matters. Therefore, if the Central Government is of the considered opinion
that in order to meet certain objectives such as the ones stated in the impugned notification, namely,
to eradicate black money, fake currency, terror funding etc., it is necessary to demonetise the
currency notes in circulation, then the Central Government may initiate a proposal for
demonetisation. 15.9 The second prong of the Learned Attorney General’s contention qua the
interpretation of sub−section (2) of Section 26 of the Act was that the Central Government has the
power to demonetise not just any one series of currency of any one denomination but it has the
power to demonetise all series of currencies of all denominations at a time. It was argued that the
expression “any” in sub−section (2) of Section 26 of the Act must mean “all”. 15.10 Per contra, it was
the submission of the learned senior counsel for the petitioners that, as the said provision stands, in
the absence of there being any guidance vis−à−vis the power of the Central Government to issue a
notification to demonetise the currency notes in circulation and in order to save such measure from
the vice of unconstitutionality, the expression “any series” and “any denomination” in sub−section
(2) of Section 26 of the Act must be restricted to mean “one series” and “one denomination”,
respectively. Otherwise, it could result in arbitrary exercise of power. He further contended that if
sub− section (2) of Section 26 of the Act is not read down in this context, it would confer unguided
and arbitrary power on the executive Government and it would amount to impermissible delegation
of legislative powers.
15.11 It was further contended by Shri Chidambaram that demonetisation is resorted to in rare and
exceptional circumstances and there are two justifiable reasons for which demonetisation could be
resorted to, namely,
1) to weed out denominations of currency that are in disuse or are practically unusable;
2) to get rid of currency which has become worthless in value because of hyperinflation.
According to learned senior counsel for the petitioners, if any demonetisation of currency has to
take place, and if the power of the Central Government is not channelised or restricted by reading
down sub− section (2) of Section 26 of the Act, it would result in arbitrariness and
unconstitutionality. Therefore, to save it from the vice of arbitrariness and unconstitutionality, it is
necessary to read down the provision in the following two respects:
a) the Central Government has no power to demonetise any currency note except on the
recommendation of the Central Board of the Bank under sub−section (2) of Section 26 of the Act,
and;
b) the expression “any” in sub− section (2) of Section 26 of the Act must be restricted to be “any
one”, that is, “one series” or “one denomination” of bank notes. That the addition of the words “any
series” before the words “of bank notes of any denomination” limits the power of the Government to
declare only a specified series of notes as no longer being a legal tender. Thus, “any series” means
any specified series and not “all series” of notes of a given denomination. 15.12 Since I have accepted
Vivek Narayan Sharma vs Union Of India on 2 January, 2023
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/164842744/
222
the contention of the learned Attorney General appearing for Union of India vis−à−vis the power of
the Central Government for initiating the process of demonetisation, the next question would be,
whether, the Central Government can, on initiating the process of demonetisation, proceed to issue
a gazette notification to demonetise any or all series of any or all denomination of bank notes, on the
strength of sub− section (2) of Section 26 of the Act. Consideration of this issue would also answer
the contention of learned senior counsel for the petitioners regarding sub−section (2) of Section 26
of the Act being unguided and arbitrary in nature and hence, unconstitutional. To this end, the
following aspects have to be examined:
(a) Whether demonetisation can be initiated and carried but by the Central Government by issuing a
notification in the Gazette of India as per sub−section (2) of Section 26 of the Act?
(b) Extent of the Central Government’s power to carry out demonetisation, i.e., whether “all series”
of “all denominations” may be demonetised.
15.13 As held hereinabove, the proposal for demonetisation can emanate either from the Central
Government or from the Central Board of the Bank. It is however necessary to contrast the proposal
for demonetisation initiated by the Central Government, with that initiated by the Central Board of
the Bank. When the Central Board of the Bank recommends demonetisation, it is in my view, only
for a particular series of bank notes of a particular denomination as specified in the
recommendation made under sub− section (2) of Section 26 of the Act. The word “any” in sub−
section (2) of Section 26 cannot be read to mean “all”. If read as “specified” or “particular” as against
all, in my view, it would not suffer from arbitrariness or suffer from unguided discretion being given
to the Central Board of the Bank.
On the other hand, in my view, the Central Government has the power to demonetise all series of
bank notes of all denominations, if the need for such a measure arises. It cannot be restricted in
such powers in such manner as the Central Board of the Bank is, under the above provision. This is
because such power is not exercised under sub−section (2) of Section 26 of the Act but is exercised
notwithstanding the said provision by the Central Government. Therefore, demonetisation of bank
notes at the behest of the Central Government is a far more serious issue having wider ramifications
on the economy and on the citizens, as compared to demonetisation of bank notes of a given series
of a given denomination on the recommendation of the Central Board of the Bank by issuance of a
gazette notification by the Central Government.
Therefore, in my considered view, the powers of the Central Government being vast, the same have
to be exercised only through a plenary legislation or a legislative process rather than by an executive
act by the issuance of a notification in the Gazette of India. It is necessary that the Parliament which
consists of the representatives of the People of this country, discusses the matter and thereafter
approves and supports the implementation of the scheme of demonetisation. 15.14 The Central
Government, as already noted above, could have several compulsions for initiating demonetisation
of the bank notes already in circulation in the economy, and it could do so even in the absence of a
recommendation, as per sub−section (2) of Section 26 of the Act, of the Central Board of the Bank.
On its proposal to demonetise the bank notes, the advice/opinion of the Central Board of the Bank
Vivek Narayan Sharma vs Union Of India on 2 January, 2023

223
which has to be consulted may not always be in support of the proposal of the Central Government
as in the year 1978. The Central Board of the Bank may give a negative opinion or a concurring
opinion. In either of the situations, the Central Government may proceed to demonetise the bank
notes but only through a legislative process, either through an Ordinance followed by a legislation, if
the Parliament is not in session; or by a plenary legislation before the Parliament and depending
upon the passage of the Bill as an Act, carry out its proposal of demonetisation. Of course,
depending upon the urgency of the situation and possibly to maintain secrecy, the option of issuance
of an Ordinance by the President of India and the subsequent enactment of a law is always available
to the Central Government by convening the Parliament. Such demonetisation of currency notes at
the instance of the Central Government cannot be by the issuance of an executive notification. The
reasons for stating so are not far to see –
(i) Firstly, because the Central Government is not acting under sub−section (2) of Section 26 of the
Act. When the Central Government initiates the process of demonetisation it is de hors sub−section
(2) of Section 26 of the Act.
(ii) Secondly, the Central Government has the power to demonetise all series of bank notes of all
denominations unlike the narrower powers vested with the Central Board of the Bank under the
aforesaid provision, if the situation so arises.
(iii) Thirdly, the Parliament which is the fulcrum in our democratic system of governance, must be
taken into confidence. This is because it is the representative of the people of the Country. It is the
pivot of any democratic country and in it rest the interests of the citizens of the Country. The
Parliament enables its citizens to participate in the decision−making process of the government. A
Parliament is often referred to as a “nation in miniature”; it is the basis for democracy. A Parliament
provides representation to the people of a country and makes their voices heard. Without a
Parliament, a democracy cannot thrive; every democratic country needs a Parliament for the smooth
conduct of its governance and to give meaning to democracy in the true sense. The Parliament
which is at the centre of our democracy cannot be left aloof in a matter of such importance. Its views
on the subject of demonetisation are critical and of utmost importance.
Dr. Subhash C. Kashyap in his book, “Parliamentary Procedure: Law, Privileges, Practice and
Precedents”, 3 rd Ed., (2014), while discussing the functions of the Parliament has stated as follows:
“Over the years, the functions of Parliament have no longer remained restricted
merely to legislating. Parliament has, in fact emerged as a multi− functional
institution encompassing in its ambit various roles viz. developmental, financial and
administrative surveillance, grievance ventilation and redressal, national
integrational, conflict resolution, leadership recruitment and training, educational
and so on. The multifarious functions of Parliament make it the cornerstone on
which the edifice of Indian polity stands and evokes admiration from many a
quarter.” It is in the above context that it is observed that on a matter as critical as
demonetisation, having a bearing on nearly 86% of the total currency in circulation,
the same could not have been carried out by way of issuance of an executive
Vivek Narayan Sharma vs Union Of India on 2 January, 2023
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/164842744/
224
notification. A meaningful discussion and debate in the Parliament on the proposed
measure, would have lent legitimacy to the exercise.
When an Ordinance is issued or a Bill is introduced in the Parliament and enacted as a law, it would
mean that it has been done by taking into confidence the Members of Parliament who are the
representatives of the people of India, who would meaningfully discuss on the proposal for
demonetisation made by the Central Government. In such an event, demonetisation would be by an
Act of Parliament and not a measure carried out by the issuance of a gazette notification by the
Central Government in exercise of its executive power. Such demonetisation through an Ordinance
or a legislation through the Parliament would be “notwithstanding what is contained in sub−section
(2) of Section 26 of the Act”. This is because in such a situation, the Central Government is not
acting on the basis of a recommendation received from the Central Board of the Bank but it would
be proposing the demonetisation. Precedent for the same may be found in the earlier
demonetisations which were also through a legislative process and not through the issuance of a
gazette notification by the Executive/Central Government. When the process of demonetisation is
carried out through a Parliamentary enactment and after being the subject of scrutiny by the
Members of Parliament, any opinion sought by the Central Government from the Central Board of
the Bank before initiating the promulgation of the Ordinance or placing the Bill before the
Parliament may also be additional material which could be considered by the Parliament. When the
Central Government initiates the proposal for demonetisation and thereafter consults the Bank on
such proposal, then it could be said that the necessary safeguards were taken, as the Central
Government would be fortified in its proposal for demonetisation having taken the advice of not
only an expert body but the highest financial authority in the country, which handles not only the
monetary policy but is also the sole authority vested with the power of issuance of bank notes or
currency notes in India. When the Central Government proposes to demonetise the currency notes,
not only the view of the Central Board of the Bank is relevant and important but also that of the
representatives of the people in the Parliament. The Members of the Parliament hold the sovereign
powers of “We, the People of India” in trust.
15.15 Of course, by contrast, there would be no difficulty if the proposal for demonetisation is
initiated by the Central Board of the Bank by making a recommendation under sub−section (2) of
Section 26 of the Act, which the Central Government in its wisdom may consider and either act
upon the recommendation or for good reason, decline to act on the same. That is a matter left to the
wisdom of the Central Government. However, as noted above such recommendation by the Bank
cannot relate to “all” series of a denomination or “all” series of “all” denominations of bank notes.
That is a prerogative of only the Central Government.
15.16 It is nobody’s case that the impugned gazette notification dated 8th November, 2016, of the
Central Government was published on the initiation of the proposal of demonetisation by the
Central Board of the Bank. The proposal for demonetisation was initiated by the Central
Government by a letter dated 7 th November, 2016 addressed by the Finance Secretary to the
Governor of the Bank. The Central Government, having “obtained” the advice of the Bank on its
proposal, proceeded to issue the impugned gazette notification on the very next day, dated 8th
November, 2016. The same was followed by an Ordinance and thereafter, an enactment was passed.

15.17 The contention of the petitioners could now be considered and answered. The words in sub−
section (2) of Section 26 of the Act would have to be interpreted/construed in their normal parlance.
It is already observed that issuance of such a notification under sub−section (2) of Section 26 of the
Act must be preceded by a recommendation of the Central Board of the Bank and such
recommendation is a condition precedent. The Central Government in its wisdom may accept the
recommendation of the Central Board of the Bank and issue a notification in the Gazette of India or
it may decline to do so. This position is evident from the use of the word “may” in sub− section (2) to
Section 26 of the Act. However, what is significant is that if demonetisation of any bank note is to
take place under sub−section (2) of Section 26 of the Act, it is only by issuance of a notification in
the Gazette of India and not by any other method or manner. In other words, the Central Board of
the Bank must first initiate the process by recommending to the Central Government to declare that
any series of bank notes of any denomination shall cease to be a legal tender by the issuance of a
notification. If the Central Government accepts the recommendation of the Central Board of the
Bank, it issues a notification in the Gazette of India carrying out the same, which is in the nature of
an executive function and the publication of the notification in the Gazette of India is only a
ministerial act. 15.18 Therefore, under sub−section (2) of Section 26 of the Act, the initiation of the
process of demonetisation and the exercise of power originates from the Central Board of the Bank
which has to recommend to the Central Government and the latter may accept the recommendation
and in such event it would issue a gazette notification. In case the Central Government does not
accept the recommendation, there will be no further action on the recommendation of the Central
Board of the Bank. Thus, sub−section (2) of the Section 26 of the Act has inherently a very restricted
operation, and is limited only to the initiation of demonetisation by the Central Board of the Bank
and making a recommendation in that regard. Issuance of the notification, in the Gazette of India,
would imply that the Central Government has accepted the recommendation of the Central Board of
the Bank and therefore, has declared that the specified series of Bank notes of the specified
denomination shall cease to be legal tender from the date to be specified in the notification. The
operation of sub− section (2) of Section 26 of the Act is thus in a very narrow compass and it is
reiterated that the said power is exercised by the Central Government on acceptance of the
recommendation of the Central Board of the Bank. 15.19 The reason as to why a wide interpretation
as contended by the Union of India cannot be given to sub−section (2) of Section 26 of the Act is
because a plain reading of the provision as well as a contextual understanding, would suggest that it
is only when the initiation of a proposal for demonetisation is by the Central Board of the Bank by
making a recommendation to the Central Government that the provision would apply.
15.20 This position, however, does not imply that the Central Government is bereft of any power or
jurisdiction to declare any bank note of any denomination to have ceased to be a legal tender. As
already observed while accepting the contention of learned Attorney General, the Central
Government in its wisdom may also initiate the process of demonetisation as has been done in the
instant case. But what is important and to be noted is that the said power cannot be exercised by the
mere issuance of an executive notification in the Gazette of India. In other words, when the proposal
to demonetise any currency note is initiated by the Central Government with or without the
concurrence of the Central Board of the Bank, it is not an exercise of the executive power of the
Central Government under sub−section (2) of Section 26 of the Act. In such a situation, as already
held, the Central Government would have to resort to the legislative process by initiating a plenary

226
legislation in the Parliament.
15.21 What is being emphasised is that the Central Government cannot act in isolation in such
matters. The Central Government has to firstly, take the opinion of the Central Board of the Bank for
the proposed demonetisation. The Central Board of the Bank may not accept the proposal of the
Central Government or may partially concur with the proposal on specific aspects. In fact, in 1978,
when the then Governor of the Bank did not accept the proposal of the Central Government to
demonetise Rs.5,000/−  and Rs.10,000/−  bank notes, the Central Government initiated the said
process through the Parliament and this culminated in the passing of the Act of 1978. In drafting the
said legislation, the expert assistance of two officers of the Bank was taken so as to fortify the
legislation. The said legislation was also challenged before this Court in the case of Jayantilal
Ratanchand Shah, Devkumar Gopaldas Aggarwal vs. Reserve Bank of India (1996) 9 SCC 650
whereby the vires of the 1978 Act was ultimately, upheld by this Court vide judgement dated 9th
August, 1996, after eighteen years of its enactment.
15.22 The reasons as to why the Central Government cannot unilaterally issue a gazette notification
but has to resort to a legislation when it initiates the proposal for demonetisation have already been
discussed. The Central Government may have very valid objectives to do so, as in the instant case,
i.e., in order to eradicate black money, fake currency and prevent currency from being utilized for
terror funding. But, those objects would not be the objects with which the Central Board of the Bank
may make a recommendation under sub−section (2) of Section 26 of the Act. The reason being, the
Central Government would view the entire scheme of demonetisation in a larger perspective, having
several objects in mind and in the interest of the sovereignty and integrity of the India, the security
of the State, the financial health of the economy, etc. The Central Board of the Bank may not be in a
position to visualize such objectives. Under such circumstances the Central Government must
consult the Bank but need not mandatorily obtain the imprimatur of the Central Board of the Bank
to its proposal. What if the Central Board of the Bank, when consulted by the Central Government,
gives a negative opinion? Would it mean that the Central Government would then not resort to
demonetisation in deference to the opinion of the Central Board of the Bank? It may do so if it finds
that the opinion tendered by the Bank is just and proper, but the Central Government may have its
own reasons for not accepting the opinion of the Central Board of the Bank and therefore, in such a
situation the Central Government will have to resort to initiate the proposal for demonetisation
through a plenary legislation, by way of introduction of a Bill in the Parliament resulting in an Act of
Parliament.
15.23 Therefore, the sum and substance of the discussion is that when the Central Board of the Bank
initiates or originates the proposal for demonetisation of any series of bank notes of any
denomination, it has to make a recommendation to the Central Government as per sub−section (2)
of Section 26 of the Act. The Central Government may act on such recommendation by issuing a
gazette notification. On the other hand, when the Central Government is the originator of the
proposal for demonetisation of any currency note as in the instant case, it has to seek the advice of
the Central Board of the Bank, for, it cannot afford to proceed in isolation and without bringing the
said proposal to the notice of the Central Board of the Bank having regard to the important position
the Bank holds in the Indian economy. Irrespective of the opinion of the Central Board of the Bank
Vivek Narayan Sharma vs Union Of India on 2 January, 2023

227
to the Central Government’s proposal, the legislative route would have to be taken by the Central
Government for furthering its objective/s of demonetisation of bank notes. Thus, the same cannot
be carried out by the issuance of a simple notification in the Gazette of India declaring that all bank
notes or currency notes are demonetised. This is because when the Central Government is the
originator of a proposal for demonetisation, it is acting de hors sub−section (2) of Section 26 of the
Act. 15.24 Such an interpretation is necessary as it is the contention of the Union of India that the
Central Government has the power to demonetise “all” series of bank notes of “all” denominations
which would mean that every Rs.1/− , Rs.5/− , Rs.10/− , Rs.20/− , Rs.50/− , Rs.100/− , Rs.500/− ,
Rs.1,000/− , Rs.5,000/− , Rs.10,000/− , could be demonetised. Since the same is possible
theoretically, in my view, such an extensive power cannot be exercised by issuance of a simple
gazette notification in exercise of an executive power of the Central Government as if it is one under
sub−section (2) of Section 26 of the Act. The same can only be through a plenary legislation, by way
of an enactment following a meaningful debate in Parliament, on the proposal of the Central
Government. This would also answer the other contention of the learned senior counsel for the
petitioners that sub−section (2) of Section 26 of the Act cannot be interpreted to mean “all series” of
bank notes of “all denominations” when the words used in the provision are “any series” of “any
denomination”.
Deciphering the plain meaning of sub− section (2) of Section 26: 15.25 The reason why power is
vested only with the Central Board of the Bank under sub− section (2) of Section 26 of the Act to
recommend to the Central Government to declare specified series of specific denomination of bank
notes as having ceased to be legal tender, becomes clear when the plain meaning of the words of the
said provision is recognised. When interpreted as such, no power to demonetise currency notes at
the behest of the Central Government is envisaged under the said provision. This is because the
power of the Central Government to do so is vast and has a wider spectrum. Such a power is not
traceable to sub−section (2) of Section 26 of the Act which operates in a narrower compass. Hence,
to save sub− section (2) of Section 26 from the vice of unconstitutionality, it must be given an
interpretation appropriate to the object for which the provision is intended. In this context, the
following principles become relevant.
15.26 When the words of a statute are clear, plain or unambiguous, i.e., they are reasonably
susceptible to only one meaning, the court is bound to give effect to that meaning and admit only
one meaning and no question of construction of a statute arises, for, the provision/Act would speak
for itself. The judicial dicta relevant to the above principle of interpretation are as follows:
(i) In Kanailal Sur vs. Paramnidhi Sadhu Khan AIR 1957 SC 907 at Page 910 this Court observed
that if the words used are capable of only one “construction” then it would not be open to the courts
to adopt any other hypothetical construction on the ground that such hypothetical construction is
more consistent with the purported object and policy of the Act. Reference was made to Section 162
of the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1898 and interpretation of the expression “any person” by Lord
Atkin, speaking for the Privy Council who observed that the expression “any person” includes any
person who may thereafter be an accused, and he observed that “when the meaning of the words is
plain, it is not the duty of Courts to busy themselves with supposed intentions” vide Pakala
Narayanaswami vs. Emperor AIR 1939 PC 47.
Vivek Narayan Sharma vs Union Of India on 2 January, 2023

228
(ii) Similarly, while construing Sections 223 and 226 of the Indian Succession Act, 1925 which
contain a prohibition in relation to grant of Probate or Letters of Administration “to any association
of individuals unless it is a company”, this Court in Illachi Devi vs. Jain Society Protection of
Orphans India (2003) 8 SCC 413, applied the plain meaning rule and held that said expression
would not include a society registered under the Societies Registration Act as a society even after
registration does not become distinct from its members and does not become a separate legal person
like a company.
(iii) For a proper application of the plain meaning rule to a given statute, it is necessary, to first
determine, whether the language used is plain or ambiguous. “Any ambiguity” means that a phrase
is fairly and equally open to diverse meanings. A provision is not ambiguous merely because it
contains a word which in different contexts is capable of different meanings. It is only when a
provision contains a word or phrase which in a particular context is capable of having more than one
meaning that it would be ambiguous.
(iv) Hence, in order to ascertain whether certain words are clear and unambiguous, they must be
studied in their context.
Context in this connection is used in a wide sense as including not only other enacting provisions of
the same statute, but its preamble, the existing state of the law, other statutes in pari materia and
the mischief which by those and other legitimate means can be discerned that the statute was
intended to remedy.
[Source: Interpretation of Statutes by Justice G.P. Singh, 15th Edition] 15.27 Applying the above
rule, if sub−section (2) of Section 26 of the Act is read as per the plain meaning of the words of the
provision, then it does not lead to any ambiguity. The plain meaning rule is the golden rule of
construction of statutes and it does not lead to any absurdity in the instant case. On a plain reading
of the provision, it is observed that the Central Government can issue a notification in the Gazette of
India to demonetise any series of bank notes of any denomination but only on the recommendation
of the Central Board of the Bank. In my view sub− section (2) of Section 26 is not vitiated by
unconstitutionality. This is for two reasons: firstly, the plain meaning of the words “any” series of
bank notes of “any denomination” would not imply “all series” of bank notes of “all denominations”.
The word “any” means specified or particular and not “all” as contended by the respondents. If the
contention of the Union of India is accepted and the word “any” is to be read as “all”, it would lead to
disastrous consequences as the Central Board of the Bank cannot be vested with the power to
recommend demonetisation of “all series of currency of all denominations”. The interpretation
suggested by learned Attorney General would lead to vesting of unguided power in the Central
Board of the Bank whereas giving a wider power to the Central Government to initiate such a
demonetisation wherein all series of a denomination could be demonetised is appropriate as it is
expected to consider all pros and cons from various angles and then to initiate demonetisation on a
large scale through a legislative process. Such a power is vested only in the Central Government by
virtue of Entry 36 of List I of the Seventh Schedule of the Constitution which of course has to be
exercised by means of a plenary legislation and not by issuance of a gazette notification under sub−
section (2) of Section 26 of the Act. Hence, the word “any” cannot be interpreted to mean “all”

229
having regard to the context in which it is used in the said provision.
15.28 Secondly, any recommendation of the Central Board of the Bank under sub− section (2) of
Section 26 is not binding on the Central Government. If the Central Government does not accept the
recommendation of the Bank then no notification would be published in the Gazette of India by it.
In fact, the Central Government is not bound by the recommendation made by the Central Board of
the Bank to demonetise any bank note, although, the Central Board of the Bank may comprise of
experts in matters relating to finance, having knowledge and experience of economic affairs of the
country and such knowledge may be reflected in the recommendation made to the Central
Government. As already noted, the Central Government has the option to accept the said
recommendation and accordingly issue a gazette notification or elect not to act on the same.
However, the Central Government should consider the recommendation with all seriousness and in
its wisdom take an appropriate decision in the matter.
16. In the instant case, on perusal of the records submitted by Union of India and the Bank, it is
noted that the proposal for demonetisation had been initiated by the Central Government by writing
a letter to the Bank on 7th November, 2016 and not by the Central Board of the Bank. On the very
next evening i.e., on 8 th November, 2016 at 05:30 p.m., there was a meeting of the Central Board of
the Bank at New Delhi and a Resolution was passed and a little while thereafter on the same
evening, the notification was issued invoking sub−section (2) of Section 26 of the Act by the Central
Government. Such a procedure is not contemplated under sub−section (2) of Section 26 of the Act
when the proposal for demonetisation is initiated by the Central Government.
16.1 Hence, it is held that in the instant case the Central Government could not have exercised power
under sub−section (2) of Section 26 of the Act in the issuance of the impugned gazette Notification
dated 8th November, 2016. It is further held that in the present case, the object and the purpose of
issuance of an Ordinance and thereafter, the enactment of the 2017 Act by the Parliament was, in
my view, to give a semblance of legality to the exercise of power by issuance of the Notification on
8th November, 2016. In fact, Section 3 of the Ordinance as well as Section 3 of the Act makes this
explicit. The same is extracted as under for immediate reference:
“3. On and from the appointed day, notwithstanding anything contained in the Reserve Bank of
India Act, 1934 or any other law for the time being in force, the specified bank notes which have
ceased to be legal tender, in view of the notification of the Government of India in the Ministry of
Finance, number S.O. 3407(E), dated the 8th November, 2016, issued under sub− section (2) of
section 26 of the Reserve Bank of India Act, 1934, shall cease to be liabilities of the Reserve Bank
under section 34 and shall cease to have the guarantee of the Central Government under sub−
section (1) of section 26 of the said Act.” (Emphasis by me) The said Section has an inherent
contradiction inasmuch as the Section has a non−obstante clause vis−à−vis the Act or any other law
for the time being in force but at the same time, the said provision refers to Sections 26 as well as
Section 34 of the Act.
A non−obstante clause such as “notwithstanding anything contained in the Act or in any law for the
time being in force”, is sometimes appended to a section, with a view to give the enacting part of that
Vivek Narayan Sharma vs Union Of India on 2 January, 2023
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/164842744/
230
section in case of conflict, an overriding effect over the provision or Act mentioned in the non
obstante clause. The following are the judicial dicta on the point which bring out the use of a non−
obstante clause:
a) In T.R. Thandur vs. Union of India (1996) 3 SCC 690, this Court observed that a non−obstante
clause may be used as a legislative device to modify the ambit of the provision or law mentioned in
the non−obstante clause or to override it in specified circumstances. That while interpreting a non−
obstante clause, the Court is required to find out the extent to which the legislature intended to give
it an overriding effect.
b) In Central Bank of India vs. State of Kerala (2009) 4 SCC 94, this Court held that while
interpreting a non−  obstante clause the court is required to find out the extent to which the
legislature intended to give it an overriding effect.
c) Further, this Court in A.G. Varadarajulu and Anr. vs. State of Tamil Nadu (1998) 4 SCC 231,
observed that it is well− settled that while dealing with a non− obstante clause under which the
legislature wants to give overriding effect to a section, the court must try to find out the extent to
which the legislature had intended to give one provision overriding effect over another provision.
The effect of insertion of a non− obstante clause into a provision in a legislation, is that the very
consideration arising from the provisions sought to be excluded, shall be excluded, vide Madhav Rao
Scindia vs. Union of India (1971) 1 SCC
85. Applying the aforesaid principles to interpret Section 3 of the 2017 Act, it is observed that the
non−obstante clause contained in the said provision has the effect of overriding the provisions of the
Act as they are not applicable to the provisions and processes under the 2016 Ordinance and the
2017 Act. It is significant to note that the said Section contains a non− obstante clause which reads,
“notwithstanding anything contained in the Act or any other law for the time being in force”. This is
rightly so as the demonetisation is not in exercise of the powers under sub−section (2) of Section 26
of the Act. However, Section 3 of the 2017 Act goes on to state that the specified bank notes which
have ceased to be legal tender, in view of the notification dated 8th November, 2016 issued under
sub−section (2) of Section 26 of the Act, shall cease to impose liabilities on the Bank under Section
34 of the Act and shall cease to have the guarantee of the Central Government under sub−section (1)
of Section 26 of the Act. Therefore, while the impugned gazette notification dated 8th November,
2016 has been admittedly issued exercising powers under sub−section (2) of Section 26 of the Act,
Section 3 of the 2017 Act also states that it is notwithstanding anything contained in the Act. If it is
so, then the impugned notification could not have been issued invoking sub−section (2) of Section
26 of the Act. The liability could have so ceased, if the power that had been exercised by the Central
Government for the issuance of the notification dated 8 th November, 2016 impugned herein, under
sub−section (2) of Section 26 of the Act on the recommendation made by the Central Board of the
Bank. That is, when the initiation of demonetisation or the proposal came from the Central Board of
the Bank, leading to the issuance of the notification by the Central Government. Had the measure of
demonetisation been carried out by way of enactment of a plenary legislation, then the non−
obstante clause could have been employed to exclude the applicability of the Act. However, having
Vivek Narayan Sharma vs Union Of India on 2 January, 2023
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/164842744/
231
sought to rely on sub−section (2) of Section 26 of the Act to issue the Notification, not only is the
non− obstante clause misplaced but it also gives rise to a contradiction as to on what basis the
Notification dated 8th November, 2016 has been issued.
Affidavits and Record of the Case:
17. It has been observed in the preceding paragraphs that when the proposal to carry out
demonetisation originates from the Central Government, irrespective of whether or not the Bank
concurs with or endorses such proposal, the Central Government would have to take the legislative
route through a plenary legislation and cannot proceed with demonetisation by simply issuing a
notification. 17.1 Having observed so, it is necessary to examine the proposal to carry out
demonetisation, in the present case, which originated from the Central Government. For this
purpose, reference may be had to the recitals of the affidavits filed by the Union of India and the
Bank, and to the extent permissible, to the records submitted by the Union of India and the Bank in
a sealed cover. 17.2 I have perused the following photocopies of the original records submitted on
behalf of the Union of India and the Reserve Bank of India:
i) Letter by the Secretary, Department of Economic Affairs, Ministry of Finance, dated 7th
November, 2016, bearing F. No. 10.03/2016 Cy.I, addressed to the Governor of the Bank;
ii) Draft Memorandum of the Deputy Governor of the Bank, placed before the Central Board of the
Bank at its 561 st Meeting;
iii) Minutes of the 561st Meeting of the Central Board of the Bank, convened at New Delhi, on 8 th
November, 2016, at 05:30 p.m., and signed on 15th November, 2016;
iv) Letter addressed by the Deputy Governor of the Bank to the Central Government on 8th
November, 2016. 17.3 On a reading of the records listed hereinabove, the following facts emerge:
1) A letter bearing F. No. 10.03/2016 Cy.I dated 7 th November, 2016 was addressed by the
Secretary, Ministry of Finance, Department of Economic Affairs, Government of India, to the
Governor of the Bank, referring to certain facts and figures to indicate the following two major
threats to the security and financial integrity of the country:
i) Fake Infusion of Currency Notes (FICN);
ii) Generation of black money in the Indian economy.
The desire of the Central Government to proceed with the measure of demonetisation was expressed
in the said letter and a request was made to the Bank to consider recommending the such measure,
in terms of the relevant clauses of the Act.
2) Further, the Draft Memorandum of the Deputy Governor of the Bank, placed before the Central
Board of the Bank, categorically states that the need for a meeting to deliberate on the proposed
Vivek Narayan Sharma vs Union Of India on 2 January, 2023
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/164842744/
232
measure of demonetisation, had arisen pursuant to the letter addressed to the Bank from the
Central Government dated 7th November, 2016. The Draft Memorandum further records that the
Government had “recommended” that the withdrawal of the tender character of existing Rs.500/−
and Rs.1,000/− notes, is apposite.
Further, the said document records that “as desired” by the Central Government, a draft scheme for
implementation of the scheme of demonetisation had also been enclosed.
3) In view of the contents of the Draft Memorandum, the Central Board of the Bank in its 561 st
Meeting commended the Central Government’s proposal for demonetisation and directed that the
same be forwarded to the Central Government.
4) Accordingly, a letter was addressed by the Deputy Governor of the Bank to the Central
Government on 8 th November, 2016, stating therein that the proposal of the Central Government
pertaining to withdrawal of legal tender of bank notes of denominational values of Rs. 500/− and
Rs. 1,000/− was placed before the Central Board of the Bank in its 561st meeting. It was also stated
that necessary recommendation to proceed with the said proposal, had been “obtained” from the
Central Board of the Bank. 17.4 On a comparative reading of the records submitted by the Union of
India as well as the Reserve Bank of India, it becomes crystal clear that the process of
demonetisation of all series of bank notes of denominational values of Rs. 500/− and Rs. 1,000/−,
commenced/originated from the Central Government. The said fact is crystalised in the
communication addressed by the Secretary, Department of Economic Affairs, Ministry of Finance,
dated 7th November, 2016 to the Governor of the Bank. The phrases and words emphasized
hereinabove clearly indicate that the proposal for demonetisation was from the Central
Government. In substance, the Central Government sought the opinion/advice of the Bank on such
proposal.
The use of the words/phrases such as, “as desired” by the Central Government; Government had
“recommended” the withdrawal of the legal tender of existing Rs.500/−  and Rs.1,000/−  notes;
recommendation has been “obtained”; etc., are self−explanatory. This demonstrates that there was
no independent application of mind by the Bank. Neither was there any time for the Bank to apply
its mind to such a serious issue. This observation is being made having regard to the fact that the
entire exercise of demonetisation of all series of bank notes of Rs.500/− and Rs.1,000/− was carried
out in twenty four hours.
A situation where an independent authority such as the Bank, based on its own appreciation of the
economic climate of the country, recommends a measure to the Central Government, must be
contrasted with another situation where a measure which originates from the Central Government is
simply placed before such independent authority for seeking its advice or opinion on such proposed
measure. A proposal of the Central Government on a certain scheme having serious economic
ramifications has to be placed before the Bank to seek its expert opinion as to the viability of such a
scheme. The Bank as an expert body may render advice on such a proposal and on some occasions
may even concur with the same. However, even such concurrence to a proposal originating from the
Central Government is not akin to an original recommendation of the Central Board of the Bank,

233
within the meaning of Section 26 (2) of the Act.
17.5 The following points emerge on perusal of the affidavits submitted on behalf of the Union of
India:
1) That the Central Board of the Bank made a specific recommendation to the Central Government
on 8 th November, 2016, for the withdrawal of legal tender character of the existing series of
Rs.500/−  and Rs.1,000/−  bank notes which could tackle black money, counterfeiting and illegal
financing. That the Bank also proposed a draft scheme for the implementation of the
recommendation.
2) That the consultations between the Central Government and the Bank began in February, 2016;
however, the process of consolidation and decision making were kept confidential.
3) That the Bank and the Central Government were together engaged in the finalization of new
designs, development of security inks and printing plates for the new designs, change in
specifications of printing machines and other critical aspects.
17.6 The following points emerge upon perusal of the affidavits submitted on behalf of the Bank:
1) That a letter dated 7th November, 2016 was received by the Bank, from the Ministry of Finance,
Government of India, which contained a proposal to withdraw the character of legal tender of
existing Rs.500/− and Rs.1,000/− bank notes.
2) The said proposal was considered, together with a draft scheme for implementing the withdrawal
of existing Rs.500/−  and Rs.1,000/−  bank notes, at the 561 st meeting of the Central Board of
Directors of the Bank, held on 8 th November, 2016, at 05:30 p.m. at New Delhi.
3) That the Central Board of Directors was assured that the matter had been the subject of
discussion between the Central Government and the Bank for six months. The said Board was also
assured that the Central Government would take adequate mitigating measures to contain the use of
cash.
4) That the Board, having observed that the proposed step presents a big opportunity to advance the
objects of financial inclusion and incentivising use of electronic modes payment, recommended the
withdrawal of legal tender of old bank notes in the denomination of Rs.500/− and Rs.1,000/−.
17.7 On a conjoint reading of the affidavits submitted by the Union of India and the Bank, the
following deductions may be drawn:
1) That the Central Government in its letter addressed to the Bank, dated 7th November, 2016
proposed to withdraw the character of legal tender of existing Rs.500/− and Rs.1,000/− bank notes.
Vivek Narayan Sharma vs Union Of India on 2 January, 2023
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/164842744/
234
2) The Central Board of the Bank, at its 561 st meeting held on 8th November, 2016 resolved that
the withdrawal of legal tender of old bank notes in the denomination of Rs.500/− and Rs.1,000/− be
made.
3) The objects guiding the Board’s opinion were two−fold: first, pertaining to financial inclusion,
and second, being to incentivise the use of electronic modes of payment.
4) The object guiding the Government’s proposal to withdraw currency of the specified
denominations, was to tackle black money, counterfeiting and illegal financing. 17.8 In my view,
there is contradiction as to the subject of demonetisation, as well the object thereof, as stated by the
Bank vis− à− vis the Central Government as discernible from the affidavits. The same may be
expressed as follows:
                         As    stated      in   the As   stated   in   the
                         affidavit of the Bank      affidavit     of   the
                                                    Central
                                                    Government
       Object         of i)    Financial            To tackle:
       Demonetisatio     inclusion              i)   black money,
ii) incentivisinguse ii) counterfeiting, n iii) illegal of electronic modes of financing.
                         payment
       Subject        of Old bank notes in the Existing      Rs.500/−
       Demonetisatio     denomination            of and Rs.1,000/− bank
       n                 Rs.500/−               and notes
                         Rs.1,000/−
The object of the measure and the subject are of relevance, in assessing the resolution of the Bank
dated 8 th November, 2016 because, the said considerations would have a bearing on the question,
whether, the Bank’s opinion was in consonance with the object sought to be achieved through
demonetisation by the Central Government’s proposal.
17.9 On a close reading of the Notification dated 8 th November, 2016, in juxtaposition with the
records, the following aspects emerge:
i) One aspect of the matter which emerges with no ambiguity is that the proposal for demonetisation
originated from the Central Government, by way of its letter addressed to the Bank, dated 7th
November, 2016. This aspect forms the central plank of the controversy at hand. That the

235
recommendation did not originate from the Bank under sub− section (2) of Section 26 of the Act,
but was “obtained” from the Bank in the form of an opinion on the proposal for demonetisation
submitted by the Central Government. Such an opinion, could not be considered to be a
recommendation as required by the Central Government in order to proceed under sub−section (2)
of Section 26 of the Act.
ii) Even if it is to be assumed for the sake of argument that the said opinion, was in fact a
“recommendation” under sub−  section (2) of Section 26 of the Act, in light of the interpretation
given by me hereinabove to the phrase “any” series or “any” denomination, to mean a specified
series/specified denomination, the recommendation itself is void inasmuch as it pertained to
demonetisation of “all” series of Bank notes of denominational values of Rs.500/− and Rs.1,000/−.
As has already been observed, the term “any” as appearing in sub−section (2) of Section 26 of the
Act could not be interpreted to mean “all” as such an interpretation would vest unguided and
expansive discretion with the Central Board of the Bank.
iii) The Notification expressly states that it is issued under sub− section (2) of Section 26 of the Act.
Therefore Section 3 of the Ordinance and Act could not, in the non−obstante clause, state that sub−
section (2) of Section 26 is not applicable to the Act.
iv) Having observed that demonetisation could not have been carried out by issuing a Notification as
contemplated under sub−section (2) of Section 26 of the Act and that the Parliament does indeed
have the competence to carry out demonetisation, on the strength of Entry 36 of List I of the
Seventh Schedule of the Constitution, the Central Government could not have exercised the power
by issuance of an executive notification.
Legal Principles applicable to the case:
18. There are certain legal principles which are applicable in this case: one is expressed in the maxim
“to do a thing a particular way or not at all”; this principle has also been expressed in terms of the
latin maxim “expressio unius est exclusio alterius”, which means that when a manner is specified for
doing a certain thing, then all other modes for carrying out such act are expressly excluded; and the
other principle is, exercise of discretion which is a well known principle in Administrative Law. The
same would be discussed at this stage. 18.1 The first principle which is of relevance to the
controversy at hand is that, where a power is given to do a certain thing in a certain way, the thing
must be done in that way or not at all and other methods of performance are necessarily forbidden
vide, Taylor vs. Taylor (1875) 1 Ch D 426. Hence, when a statute requires a particular thing to be
done in a particular manner, it must be done in that manner or not at all and other methods of
performance are necessarily forbidden, vide Nazir Ahmed vs. King Emperor (1936) L.R. 63 I.A. 372.
18.2 This Court too, has applied this maxim in the following cases:
(i) Parbhani Transport Co− operative Society Ltd. vs. The Regional Transport
Authority, Aurangabad (1960) (3) S.C.R. 177: AIR 1960 SC 801, wherein it was
observed that the rule provides that an expressly laid down mode of doing something
necessarily implies a prohibition of doing it in any other way.

(ii) In Dipak Babaria vs. State of Gujarat AIR 2014 SC 1972, this Court set aside the sale of
agricultural land, on the ground that the sale was not in compliance with the statutory procedure
prescribed in that regard under the Bombay Tenancy and Agricultural Lands (Vidarbha Region) Act,
1958. The matter was examined on the anvil of the aforestated maxim and it was held that alienation
of agricultural land by adopting any alternate procedure to the one prescribed under the Act, was
necessarily forbidden.
(iii) In Kameng Dolo vs. Atum Welly AIR 2017 SC 2859, election of an unopposed candidate was
declared as invalid on the ground that the nomination of his opponent was not withdrawn as per the
procedure statutorily mandated. That the nomination of the opposite candidate ought to have been
withdrawn in the manner provided for under the relevant statute and withdrawing the same in any
other manner was necessarily forbidden. That withdrawal of the nomination, not carried out in
accordance with the procedure established under the relevant statute, enabled the successful
candidate to win unopposed. Hence, his election was declared as void.
(iv) Similarly, in The Tahsildar, Taluk Office, Thanjore vs. G. Thambidurai AIR 2017 SC 2791,
assignment of land was cancelled on the ground that statutory requirements were not followed in
assigning the land. It was held that when a statute prescribes that a certain Act is to be carried out in
a given manner, the said Act could not be carried out through any mode other than the one
statutorily prescribed.
(v) It may also be apposite to refer to the decision of this Court in Union of India vs. Charanjit S. Gill
(2000) 5 SCC 742, wherein this Court held that any provisions introduced by way of “Notes”
appended to the Sections of the Army Act, 1950, could not be read as a part of the Act and therefore
such notes could not take away any right vested under the said Act. It was observed that issuance of
an administrative order or a “Note” pertaining to a special type of weapon to bring it within the
ambit of the Army Act, which was hitherto not included therein, could not be said to have been
included in the manner in which it was supposed to be included. That the Army Act empowers the
Central Government to make rules and regulations for carrying into effect the provisions of the Act;
however, no power is conferred upon the Central Government of issuing “Notes” or “issuing orders”
which could have the effect of the Rules made under the Act. That rules and Regulations or
administrative instructions can neither be supplemented nor substituted by “Notes”. That
administrative instructions issued or the “Notes” attached to the Rules which are not referable to
any statutory authority cannot be permitted to bring about a result, which is supposed to be
achieved through enactment of Rules.
What emerges from the above discussion is that when a statute contemplates a specific procedure to
be adhered to in order to arrive at a desired end, such procedure cannot be substituted by an
alternative procedure which is not contemplated under the statute. Further, if an action is to be
carried out by way of issuance of a particular statutory instrument on the basis of certain
requirements, such action cannot be validly carried out by way of issuance of an instrument when
the same is not contemplated under the Act. This is particularly so when the instrument enacted
stands on a different footing than the one meant to be enacted.

237
Applying the said principle to the facts of the present case, it is observed that what ought to have
been done through a Parliamentary enactment or plenary legislation, could not have been carried
out by simply issuing a notification under sub− section (2) of Section 26 of the Act by the Central
Government. As noted hereinabove, the said provision does not apply to cases where the proposal
for demonetisation originates from the Central Government and the same is not envisaged under
the Act. Hence, issuance a notification to give effect to the Central Government’s proposal for
demonetisation, was clearly based on an incorrect understanding of sub−section (2) of Section 26 of
the Act. The Central Government did not follow the procedure contemplated under law to give effect
to its proposal for demonetisation. This is not a matter of form but one of substance as in law, the
powers of the Central Board of the Bank and the Central Government are totally distinct in the
matter of demonetisation of bank notes.
19. The other legal principle is concerning exercise of discretion in Administrative Law. Lords
Halsbury in Sharp vs. Wakefield 1891 AC 173 described the concept of discretion in the following
words:
“When it is said that something is to be done within the discretion of the authorities
that something is to be done according to the rules of reason and justice, not
according to private opinion ...according to law and not humour. It is to be, not
arbitrary, vague and fanciful, but legal and regular. And it must be exercised within
the limit, to which an honest man competent to the discharge of his office ought to
confine himself.” 19.1 It is a well− established rule of administrative law that
discretionary power is to be exercised and a decision has to be made, by the very
authority to whom the discretion is entrusted by the statute in question. The situation
of an authority not exercising its discretion arises when any authority does not itself
consider a particular matter before it on merits but still takes a decision, as if it is
directed to do so, by another authority, most often, by a higher authority. When an
authority exercises the discretion vested in it by law at the behest of another authority
in a specific matter, this would in law amount to non− exercise of its discretionary
power by the authority itself, and consequently, such action or decision is invalid.
19.2 The petitioners have contended that it is implicit in sub−section (2) of Section 26 of the Act that
adequate time and attention must be devoted by both the Central Board of the Bank and the Central
Government before proceeding with a measure of such magnitude and consequences, as
demonetisation. It was further submitted that the facts and records of the present case would show
that the procedure with such implicit obligations was abandoned and the process contemplated was
not as per the said provision. That the proposal emanated from the Central Government and was not
initiated by the Bank. The Central Board of the Bank passed a resolution in a hurried manner. No
adequate care and consideration were bestowed on such a crucial matter by the Central Board of the
Bank having regard to the severe ramifications that the proposed demonetisation would have on
almost every citizen of the country. Possibly, the Central Board of the Bank acted on the
“assurances” of the Central Government which is evident on a perusal of the records and not on an
independent application of mind owing to lack of time.

238
As noted from the records submitted by the Central Government as well as the Reserve Bank of
India in the instant case, the Central Government wrote to the Central Board of the Reserve Bank of
India on 7 th of November, 2016 about its proposal to demonetise all series of bank notes of
denominations of Rs.500/− and Rs.1,000/−, which were in circulation, and on the very next day i.e.,
8 th November, 2016, a meeting of the Central Board of the Bank was held at New Delhi at 05:30
p.m. and shortly thereafter, the gazette notification was issued. Such a swift action would indicate
that the Central Board of the Bank had hardly twenty−four hours to consider the proposal of the
Central Government and hence, hardly any time to apply its mind independently to the proposal. It
is clear from the records submitted that the Central Government “assured” the Central Board of the
Bank that sufficient safeguards would be taken while embarking on the process of demonetisation
and that it would also result in reducing bank notes in the economy and a switch over to the
digitalisation of the economy. The Central Board of the Bank, in resolving to opine on the measure
of demonetisation to the Central Government, acted only on such “assurances”.
19.3 Further, the Central Government cannot in the guise of seeking an opinion on its proposal to
demonetise bank notes, “obtain” a “recommendation from the Central Board of the Bank” as if it is
acting under sub−section (2) of Section 26 of the Act, and consequently, issue a gazette notification
by which demonetisation of bank notes would be given effect to. Such a procedure, in my view,
would be contrary to the import of sub− section (2) of Section 26 of the Act, inasmuch as the Central
Government cannot act under the said provision by the issuance of a notification, as if a
“recommendation” has been made by the Central Board of the Bank when in fact, what actually
transpired in the instant case, was that the Central Government initiated the process of
demonetisation by formulating a proposal in this regard and subsequently secured the imprimatur
of the Bank on such proposal. In fact, the Central Board of the Bank has no jurisdiction to
“recommend” demonetisation of bank notes of “all series” of “all denomination” to the Central
Government, as already held above.
19.4 The powers of the Central Board of the Bank are restrictive in nature inasmuch as it can only
recommend that a particular series of a particular denomination would cease to be legal tender.
Hence, the Central Government cannot rely on the semblance of a “recommendation made to it by
the Central Board of the Bank under sub−section (2) of Section 26 of the Act” when it initiates the
process of demonetisation. The Central Government also cannot “obtain” any recommendation to
that effect, and if it has done so, it would imply that the Central Board of the Bank is acting at the
behest of the Central Government, only to concur with what the Central Government intends to do.
Such an opinion would not be on the basis of any independent application of mind of the experts
who form the Central Board of the Bank. Moreover, when the Central Government seeks the opinion
of the Central Board of the Bank to its proposal for demonetisation, the latter would have to be given
some time to consider the pros and cons and the impact that it would have on the citizens of India,
as bank notes are a species of negotiable instruments and a medium through which goods and
services are traded and therefore, they are the lifeline of the economy. The Central Government also
failed to indicate that the demonetised currency had lost the guarantee provided vide sub−section
(1) of Section 26 of the Act in the impugned notification. Hence, an Ordinance had to be issued on
30 th December, 2016. Moreover, it is not known whether the Bank had made arrangements for
printing sufficient new notes for exchange of demonetised currency. It is also not known whether
Vivek Narayan Sharma vs Union Of India on 2 January, 2023
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/164842744/
239
the Department of Legal Affairs was consulted in the matter as the procedure of demonetisation
involves legal implications. 19.5 Hence, in my considered view, the action of demonetisation
initiated by the Central Government by issuance of the impugned notification dated 8th November,
2016 was an exercise of power contrary to law and therefore unlawful. Consequently, the 2016
Ordinance and 2017 Act are also unlawful. But, having regard to the fact that the demonetisation
process was given effect to from 8th November, 2016 onwards, the status quo ante cannot be
restored at this point of time. What relief may be awarded in the present case?
20. In view of the above conclusion, the question of moulding the relief shall now be considered.
According to the petitioners, around 86 per cent of the volume of currency notes of the total
currency in circulation in the Indian economy was demonetised. They also stated that the people of
India were exposed to undue hardships owing to the lack of financial resources and had to undergo
not only a severe financial crunch but were also exposed to other socio−economic and psychological
hardships. The problems associated with the measure of demonetisation would make one wonder
whether the Central Board of the Bank had visualised the consequences that would follow. Whether
the Central Board of the Bank had attempted to take note of the adverse effects of demonetisation of
such a large volume of bank notes in circulation? The objective of the Central Government may have
been sound, just and proper, but the manner in which the said objectives were achieved and the
procedure followed for the same, in my view was not in accordance with law having regard to the
interpretation given above.
It has also been brought on record that around 98% of the value of the demonetised currency have
been exchanged for bank notes which continues to be legal tender. Also, a new series of bank notes
of Rs.2,000/− was released by the Bank. This would suggest that the measure itself may not have
proved to be as effective as it was hoped to be. However, this Court does not base its decision on the
legality of a legislation, qua the effectiveness of such action in achieving the stated objectives.
Therefore, it is clarified that any relief moulded in the present cases is de hors considerations of
success of the measure. 20.1 I have borne in mind the submissions of learned Attorney General
appearing on behalf of the Union of India to the effect that the objectives of the Central Government
have been sound, just and proper, but in my view, the manner in which the said objectives were
achieved and the procedure followed for the same was not in accordance with law having regard to
the interpretation given above.
Learned Attorney General appearing on behalf of the Union of India also contended that the issues
raised in these petitions have become infructuous and wholly academic as the action of
demonetisation has been acted upon and therefore, the present cases are only of academic
significance. It is necessary to examine the nature of relief that could be moulded by the Court in
this matter.
20.2 There are several judgments which could be relied upon in this context:
(i) This Court acknowledged in S.R. Bommai vs. Union of India AIR 1994 SC 1918, that although
substantive relief may be granted only if the issue remains live in cases which are justiciable, this
Court may prospectively declare a law, for posterity. Notwithstanding the fact that no substantive
Vivek Narayan Sharma vs Union Of India on 2 January, 2023
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/164842744/
240
relief could be granted in the said case for the reason that following the Presidential proclamation,
fresh elections had been held and new Houses had been constituted, this Court went on to declare
the law, for posterity, as to the federal character of the Constitution, the nature of the power
conferred on the President under Article 356 of the Constitution and the manner in which such
power is to be exercised for imposing President’s Rule in a State by dissolution of the Legislative
Assembly.
(ii) In Golak Nath vs. State of Punjab (1967) 2 SCR 762, this Court declared that it is open to the
Court, to find and declare the law, but restrict the operation of such law to the future.
(iii) Further, the observations made by this Court in Orissa Cement Ltd. vs. State of Orissa 1991
Supp (1) SCC 430, while determining what relief that could be granted following a declaration of a
provision of an enactment as invalid, are also relevant. This Court held that declaration of invalidity
of a provision, and determination of the relief to be granted as a consequence of such invalidity, are
two distinct things. That in respect of the relief to be granted as a consequence of declaration of
invalidity, the Court has discretion which could be exercised to grant, mould or restrict the relief.
20.3 In the instant case, the elementary question that requires determination is, whether the
challenge to the validity of the Central Government’s decision dated 8 th November, 2016 to
demonetise all Rs.500/−  and Rs.1,000/−  bank notes, having been adjudicated upon, at this
juncture, i.e., after a lapse of over six years since the impugned action was carried out, the nature of
relief that could be granted by this Court at this juncture is to be considered.
20.4 Stated very patently, the controversy in the present cases relates to the true meaning and
interpretation of sub− section (2) of Section 26 of the Act. Therefore, the question that arises for
consideration is, whether, this Court can declare the law as to the validity of an action, even after
such action has been given effect to in toto. That is to say, once the action has been completely
carried out, and there is no element of such action which is left to be carried out, can there still be a
subsequent declaration by this Court as to the validity of such act, having regard to the
interpretation accorded to the provisions of the relevant statute.
20.5 As discussed hereinabove, this Court has acknowledged on several occasions that it has the
competence to declare the law on a subject for posterity, even though no substantive relief may be
given under the circumstances of a given case, vide S.R. Bommai. The effect of such declaration
would apply prospectively. That is, in the present case if a declaration is made to the effect that the
impugned action was unlawful, such declaration would only have the effect of deterring future
measures from being carried out in a like manner, in order to save such measures, from the vice of
unlawfulness. Such declarations as to validity or invalidity of a measure, may be made by this Court
in exercise of its power under Article 141 of the Constitution, and the effect of such declaration may
be moulded or restricted by exercising the power vested with this Court under Article 142.
20.6 Reference may also be had to the decision of this Court in Jayantilal Ratanchand Shah,
Devkumar Gopaldas Aggarwal vs. Reserve Bank of India AIR 1997 SC 370. The said case pertains to
the challenge to the Constitutional validity of the High Denomination Bank Notes (Demonetisation)
Vivek Narayan Sharma vs Union Of India on 2 January, 2023
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/164842744/
241
Act, 1978. Although the enactment related to the year 1978 and its effects were immediate, as in the
present case, the validity of the same was conclusively declared by this Court only in the year 1997.
This Court, while upholding the validity of the legislation impugned therein, authoritatively clarified
and declared the law on the Parliamentary power to enact such a legislation. A declaration of a
similar nature, i.e., as to the validity or invalidity of the impugned actions and Notification, is what
is sought for in the present petitions.
Conclusions:
21. In view of the aforesaid discussion, the following conclusions are arrived at:
(i) According to sub−section (1) of Section 26 of the Act, every bank note shall be legal tender at any
place in India in payment or on account for the amount expressed therein and shall be guaranteed
by the Central Government. This provision is subject to sub− section (2) of Section 26 of the Act.
(ii) Sub− section (2) of Section 26 of the Act applies only when a proposal for demonetisation is
initiated by the Central Board of the Bank by way of a recommendation being made to the Central
Government. The said recommendation can be in respect of any series of bank notes of any
denomination which is interpreted to mean any specified series of bank notes of any specified
denomination.
(iii) The expression any series of bank notes of any denomination has been given its plain,
grammatical meaning, having regard to the context of the provision and not a broad meaning. Thus,
the word “any” will mean a specified series or a particular series of bank notes. Similarly, “any”
denomination will mean any particular or specified denomination of bank notes.
(iv) If the word “any” is not given a plain grammatical meaning and interpreted to mean “all series
of bank notes” of “all denominations”, it would vest with the Central Board of the Bank unguided
and unlimited powers which would be ex− facie arbitrary and suffer from the vice of
unconstitutionality as this would amount to excessive vesting of powers with the Bank. In order to
save the provision from being declared unconstitutional, the meaning of the provision is read down
to the context of the Central Board of the Bank initiating a proposal for demonetisation by making a
recommendation to the Central Government under sub−  section (2) of Section 26 of the Act of a
particular series of bank note of any denomination.
(v) On receipt of the said recommendation made by the Central Board of the bank under sub−
section (2) of Section 26 of the Act, the Central Government may accept the said recommendation or
may not do so. If the Central Government accepts the recommendation, it may issue a notification in
the Gazette of India specifying the date w.e.f. which any specified series of bank notes of any
specified denomination shall cease to be legal tender and shall cease to have the guarantee of the
Central Government.
(vi) The provisions of the Act do not bar the Central Government from proposing or initiating
demonetisation. It could do so having regard to its plenary powers under Entry 36 of List I of the
Vivek Narayan Sharma vs Union Of India on 2 January, 2023
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/164842744/
242
Seventh Schedule of the Constitution of India. However, it has to be done only by an Ordinance
being issued by the President of India followed by an Act of Parliament or by plenary legislation
through the Parliament. The Central Government cannot demonetise bank notes by issuance of a
gazette notification as if it is exercising power under sub−section (2) of Section 26 of the Act. In such
circumstances when the Central Government is initiating the process of demonetisation, it would
not be acting under sub− section (2) of Section 26 of the Act but notwithstanding the said provision
through a legislative process.
(vii) When such power is exercised by the Central Government by means of a legislation, it is by
virtue of Entry 36, List I of the Seventh Schedule of the Constitution of India which deals with
currency, coinage and legal tender; foreign exchange which is a field of legislation. Hence, the power
of the Central Government to demonetise any currency is notwithstanding anything contained in
Section 26 of the Act.
(viii) When the Central Government proposes demonetisation of any bank note, it must seek the
opinion of the Central Board of the Bank having regard to the fact that the Bank is the sole authority
to regulate circulation of bank notes and secure monetary stability and generally to operate the
currency and credit system of the country and to maintain price stability.
(ix) The opinion of the Central Board of the Bank ought to be an independent and frank opinion
after a meaningful discussion by the Central Board of the Bank which ought to be given its due
weightage having regard to the ramifications it may have on the Indian economy and the citizens of
India although it may not be binding on the Central Government. On receipt of a negative opinion
from the Central Board of the Bank, the Central Government which has initiated the demonetisation
process may still intend to go ahead with the said process after weighing the pros and cons only by
means of an Ordinance and/or Parliamentary legislation but not by issuance of a gazette
notification. In other words, the Central Government in such circumstances cannot resort to
exercise of power under sub−  section (2) of Section 26 of the Act by issuing a notification in the
Gazette of India as if it were exercising executive powers. Even if the Central Board of the Bank
concurs with the proposal of the Central Government, the Central Government would have to
undertake a legislative process and not carry out the measure by simply issuing a gazette
notification.
(x) In view of the aforesaid conclusions, I am of the considered view that the impugned notification
dated 8th November, 2016 issued under sub−section (2) of Section 26 of the Act is unlawful. In the
circumstances, the action of demonetisation of all currency notes of Rs.500/− and Rs.1,000/− is
vitiated.
(xi) Further, the subsequent Ordinance of 2016 and Act of 2017 incorporating the terms of the
impugned notification are also unlawful.
(xii) However, having regard to the fact that the impugned notification dated 8th November, 2016
and the Act have been acted upon, the declaration of law made herein would apply prospectively and
would not affect any action taken by the Central Government or the Bank pursuant to the issuance
Vivek Narayan Sharma vs Union Of India on 2 January, 2023
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/164842744/
243
of the Notification dated 8 th November, 2016. This direction is being issued having regard to
Article 142 of the Constitution of India. Hence, no relief is being granted in the individual matters.
(xiii) In view of the above conclusions, I do not think it is necessary to answer the other questions
raised in the reference order.
22. Before parting, I wish to observe that demonetisation was an initiative of the Central
Government, targeted to address disparate evils, plaguing the Nation’s economy, including,
practices of hoarding “black” money, counterfeiting, which in turn enable even greater evils,
including terror funding, drug trafficking, emergence of a parallel economy, money laundering
including Havala transactions. It is beyond the pale of doubt that the said measure, which was
aimed at eliminating these depraved practices, was well−intentioned. The measure is reflective of
concern for the economic health and security of the country and demonstrates foresight. At no point
has any suggestion been made that the measure was motivated by anything but the best intentions
and noble objects for the betterment of the Nation. The measure has been regarded as unlawful only
on a purely legalistic analysis of the relevant provisions of the Act and not on the objects of
demonetisation.
23. In view of the answer given by me to question no.1 of the reference order, I do not deem it
necessary to answer all other questions of the reference order or even the questions reframed by His
Lordship B.R. Gavai, J. during the course of the judgment except to the extent discussed above.
24. In the result, the writ petitions, special leave petitions and transfer petitions are directed to be
posted before the appropriate Bench after seeking orders from Hon’ble the Chief Justice of India. I
would like to acknowledge and place on record my appreciation for the learned Attorney General for
India, all learned senior counsel, learned instructing counsel as well as the learned counsel, for their
assistance in the matter.
Parties to bear their respective costs.
