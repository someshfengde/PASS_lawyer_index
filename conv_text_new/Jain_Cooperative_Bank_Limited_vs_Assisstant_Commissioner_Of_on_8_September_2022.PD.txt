                                                         JUDGMENT
MANMOHAN, J: (ORAL)
1. Present writ petition has been filed challenging the Order passed under Section 148A(d) and the
Notice issued under Section 148 of the Income Tax Act, 1961 ('the Act') dated 30th July, 2022 for
Assessment Year 2017-18.
2. Learned counsel for the petitioner states that the reassessment proceedings cannot be initiated
merely based on 'suspicion' or 'surmise' and Signature Not Verified Digitally Signed By:JASWANT
Signing Date:14.09.2022 18:03:49 the reasons for reopening as provided in the impugned Notices
are insufficient and amount to a mere 'change of opinion' on an aspect already known to the
respondents. He states that the cash deposited in Bank during demonetization and / or remitted by
way of cheques were duly disclosed in the Income Tax Return Form, and Financial Statements of the
Assessee. He asserts that the cash deposited belonged to the assessee's customers/ depositors and
was not the assessee's money. He states that there has been no complaint against the Bank by its
customers / depositors and all the data duly synchronized had been made available to the
respondents on multiple occasions.
3. He further submits that the primary allegation for initiating reassessment proceedings against the
petitioner is that irregularly high amount of currency notes had been deposited in the petitioner's
accounts during AY 2017-18 i.e. during demonetization. He states that the respondents have failed

to consider that the petitioner, being a bank, was merely following the RBI's instructions and high
volume of old 500 and 1000 currency notes were deposited with the petitioner by its customers
during the permitted period by the RBI.
4. He submits that no foul play was detected during search and seizure operations conducted by the
IT department in 2018 and the assessment proceedings were completed vide Assessment Order
dated 29th December, 2018. He submits that the bank is now being arbitrarily subjected to
reassessment proceedings even after the accounts where cash was deposited have already been
assessed.
5. He also states that the impugned notice and order are void-ab-initio as the respondent No. l has
failed to comply with Section 148A (d) as well as Signature Not Verified Digitally Signed
By:JASWANT Signing Date:14.09.2022 18:03:49 the Instruction No. l of 2022 issued by respondent
No.2 which provide that the assessing officer, shall decide on material available on record including
the reply of the assessee. He points out that the Notice dated 31st May, 2022 issued under Section
148A(b) granted time of two weeks (before 14 days) to the assessee to respond. He contends that
though the assessee vide the letter dated 13th June, 2022 sought further time to gather information,
yet the AO did not respond to the request of the assessee. He points out that the assessee vide the
letter dated 28th June, 2022 filed detailed reply, which was not considered by the Assessing Officer.
He submits that the action of respondents in issuing order dated 30th July, 2022 without taking
into consideration the detailed reply dated 28th June, 2022 filed by the petitioner in response to the
respondent No.l's letter / Show Cause Notice dated 31st May, 2022 is illegal.
6. Having heard learned counsel for the petitioner, this Court is of the views that the petitioner has
challenged the reopening proceedings on merits of the case. The Supreme Court in the case of
Raymond Woollen Mills Ltd. vs. ITO And Ors., [1999 236 ITR 34 SC] has held as under:-
"3. In this case, we do not have to give a final decision as to whether there is
suppression of material facts by the assessee or not. We have only to see whether
there was prima facie some material on the basis of which the Department could
reopen the case. The sufficiency or correctness of the material is not a thing to be
considered at this stage. We are of the view that the court cannot strike down the
reopening of the case in the facts of this case. It will be open to the assessee to prove
that the assumption of facts made in the notice was erroneous. The assessee may also
prove that no new facts came to the knowledge of the Income-tax Officer after
completion of the assessment proceeding. We are Signature Not Verified Digitally
Signed By:JASWANT Signing Date:14.09.2022 18:03:49 not expressing any opinion
on the merits of the case. The questions of fact and law are left open to be
investigated and decided by the assessing authority. The appellant will be entitled to
take all the points before the assessing authority. The appeals are dismissed. There
will be no order as to costs."

7. Further, as per the notice issued under Section 148A(b) the reassessment
proceedings were initiated on the basis of suspicious transactions flagged by the FIU
[Financial Intelligence Unit]. It is pertinent to mention that the petitioner is
registered as a non-scheduled Urban Co-
operative bank who 'maintained current accounts with Chandni Chowk, Shakarpur and
Karkardooma Branches, New Delhi a/c no. 523011066574, 523011066582, 634011031880,
683011012827, 683011012860 had deposited huge cash amounting to Rs.141.28 crores during the
period from 01st April, 2016 to 31st December, 2016'. From the Search Assessment order under
Section 153A dated 29th December, 2018, it is not clear whether these deposits were verified by the
Assessing Officer or not. In fact, the Assessment Order passed under Section 153A read with Section
143(3) dated 29th December, 2018 is an order passed pursuant to the search, wherein it seems only
the documents seized during the search were considered. The said order does not reveal that the
aspect of cash deposits was specifically examined by the Assessing Officer. The Supreme Court in the
case of Income Tax Officer v. Techspan India Pvt. Ltd. and Anr., (2018) 6 SCC 685 has held under:-
"12. Before interfering with the proposed re-opening of the assessment on the ground
that the same is based only on a change in opinion, the court ought to verify whether
the assessment earlier made has either expressly or by necessary implication
expressed an Signature Not Verified Digitally Signed By:JASWANT Signing
Date:14.09.2022 18:03:49 opinion on a matter which is the basis of the alleged
escapement of income that was taxable. If the assessment order is non-speaking,
cryptic or perfunctory in nature, it may be difficult to attribute to the assessing officer
any opinion on the questions that are raised in the proposed re-assessment
proceedings. Every attempt to bring to tax, income that has escaped assessment,
cannot be absorbed by judicial intervention on an assumed change of opinion even in
cases where the order of assessment does not address itself to a given aspect sought
to be examined in the re-assessment proceedings."
(emphasis supplied)
8. Further, as far as non-consideration of petitioner's reply is considered, it is settled
law that 'principle of natural justice is no unruly horse and no lurking land mine' as
held by Mr.Justice Krishna Iyer in Chairman, Board of Mining Examination and
Chief Inspector of Mines Vs. Ramjee, (1997) 2 SCC 256. In fact, in M/s S.Tikara Vs.
State of M.P. & Ors, AIR 1997 SC 1691, it has been held that the principles of natural
justice cannot be petrified or fitted into rigid moulds. They are flexible and turn on
the facts and circumstances of each case. Consequently, the questions that arise are
whether there has been any unfair deal by the respondent?
9. In the present instance, in view of the allegation of cash deposits of 141.28 crores during
demonetization period, this Court is of the opinion that even if the reply now sought to be relied
upon by the petitioner was taken into account, notice under Section 148 of the Act was called for - as
a prima facie case of escapement of income was made out. Consequently, no ground for interdicting

the reassessment is made out at this stage.
10. Accordingly, the present writ petition along with pending applications is dismissed. However,
this Court clarifies that the Assessing Officer shall decide the matter on its own merits without being
influenced by any Signature Not Verified Digitally Signed By:JASWANT Signing Date:14.09.2022
18:03:49 observation made in the present order. The rights and contentions of all the parties are left
open.
