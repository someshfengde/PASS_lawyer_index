5. The brief facts giving rise to filing of the present bail application are as under:
6. On 31.12.2020, the CBI registered a FIR bearing No. RC0742020E0014 against M/s Shakti Bhog
Foods Ltd. (hereinafter called as SBFL) and Mr. Kewal Krishan Kumar, Director/ Promoter of M/s
SBFL under Section 120B read with Section 420/ 467/ 468/ 471 and 13(2) read with Section 13(1)(d)
of the Prevention of Corruption Act, 1988 (hereinafter called as PC Act).
7. The FIR was registered based on a written complaint dated 11.06.2020 lodged by the State Bank
of India (SBI). The allegations in the FIR pertain to financial irregularity and siphoning of funds in

relation to credit facilities obtained by SBFL from a consortium of banks led by the SBI and thereby
causing a loss of Rs. 3269.42 crores.
8. The Ld counsel for the applicant states that the applicant was not named as an accused/ suspect
in the FIR. As per the FIR, the review period/period under enquiry of offence was between 2013 and
2017.
9. The applicant was an internal auditor of the SBFL for the financial year 2008-09 till 2013-14, and
a statutory auditor of SBFL for the financial year 2006-07.
10. In the column No.12 of the FIR, the observations of the I.O. read as under:-

"11. So far as assessment of the merits of the present application under section 439
Cr.P.C. is concerned, the first step has to be to apply the „triple test€. The applicant is
not a flight risk since his passport stands deposited in the Court as a condition
precedent for hearing his pre-arrest bail application. The argument of applicant
having deep roots was also raised and considered while disposing off the first regular
bail application. At that stage, the argument of „applicant€s deep roots in the
society€ was considered to be multidimensional and hence, rejected. At this stage
however, the same consideration would not apply due to change in circumstance i.e.
filing of supp. complaint arraigning the applicant. Though it has been stoutly argued
by the ld. Spl. PP that investigation qua the role of the applicant is still on-going, the
facts suggest a different picture. The supp. compliant was filed on 11.10.2021. Since
then, the IO has not examined a single witness to further investigate the Signature
Not Verified ARORA Signing Date:08.02.2023 12:07:41 role of applicant. It was not
until the present application came to be filed on 1.11.2021 that an application was
moved to further question the applicant in jail premises and submission was put
forth during the course of arguments on behalf of the ED that 3 more persons have
been summoned for questioning to understand role of the applicant in the alleged
offence. I have perused the case diary. 2 of those 3 persons have also been
questioned, on 11.11.2021 and 13.11.2021. More importantly, the line of questioning of
these 2 persons was only to further confirm the (alleged) role of the applicant in
SBFL, something which has already been highlighted by a number of other witnesses.
Further, so far as the apprehension of danger to his life has been expressed by a
witness who also happens to be a long-running close associate of the applicant, ld.
Counsel for the applicant pointed out that the statement of the said witness was recorded on
21.9.2021 but strangely, was not highlighted by the ED while arguing against the first regular bail
application of the applicant. This shows how much really was this apprehension a concern for the
ED such that it was not even brought to the notice of the Court on the earlier occasion when it
should and could have been. I would agree with the submission of ld. Counsel for the applicant.
Additionally, Ld. Counsel for the applicant has correctly placed reliance on the relevant judgements
(cited above) to argue that mere apprehension of influencing the witnesses by the accused, without
any real basis to entertain such an apprehension, is not a good ground for rejection of a regular bail.
Even otherwise, as has been observed above, the investigation Signature Not Verified ARORA
Signing Date:08.02.2023 12:07:41 qua the role of the applicant seems to be practically over, leaving
little scope for the accused to hamper the investigation by influencing witnesses. It needs a highlight
that though wife of the applicant has been arraigned in the supp. complaint and the son of the
applicant has also been questioned by the ED, yet there has been no complaint by the ED to the
effect that either of them has approached any witness.
Ld. Spl. PP also raised the argument of investigating now turning towards the role of bank officers in
laundering crime proceeds and the role of applicant in this regard i.e. in siphoning off bank funds
(crime proceeds) through dummy entities/transactions. Suffice to say that it has been more than a
month since the supp. complaint was filed and yet, from 8.10.2021 till 11.11.20021, no witness was
summoned to further investigate the role of the applicant, and even on 11.11.2021 and 13.11.2021,

the ED was only investigating the role of the applicant by summoning his employees and partner
which also was done after the 2nd regular bail application was filed on 2.11.2021.
So far as the possibility of tampering with collected evidence is concerned, apart from the
statements of witnesses recorded u/s 50 PML Act 2002, the evidence being in the nature of
voluminous data and electronic records is already in the safe possession of the ED leaving no scope
of its tampering by the applicant."
17. The Special Judge (PC Act) rejected the bail application of the applicant on considerations of
parameters of Section 45of the Prevention of Money Laundering Act, 2002 (hereinafter called as
PMLA).
Signature Not Verified ARORA Signing Date:08.02.2023 12:07:41
18. In the prosecution complaint, the allegations against the applicant are that the applicant had
designed the entire plan of laundering of loan funds through dummy entities. By virtue of this
mechanism on one hand the turnover and the stock of the company was inflated and on the other
hand the loan funds were laundered. On analysis of the bank statement of shell corporations, it was
revealed that funds received from SBFL were either withdrawn in cash or re-routed to further shell
companies. It is submitted that all the entities mentioned in the prosecution complaint do not name
the applicant. The applicant had nothing to do with these accommodation entries made by SBFL
through various shell companies. Accommodation entries through shell companies:
19. Mr Devki Nandan Garg and Mr Ashok Kumar Goel have been cited as accommodation entry
operators. Mr Devki Nandan Garg and Mr Ashok Kumar Goel have named the accused in their

ARORA Signing Date:08.02.2023 12:07:41 E. Shri Sidharth Kumar has also filed Retraction dated
06.08.2022 (Key Managerial Personnel and also Son of Promoter - Kewal Krishan Kumar).
(Arrested on 22.06.2022).
25. Lastly and most importantly it is submitted that besides the two statements of Ashok Kumar
Goel and Devki Nandan Garg there is nothing else that links the applicant with the allegations made
by the ED.
26. The next allegation is that fictitious stock damage report was got prepared at the applicant€s
instance and he attended the meeting as a special invitee where decision for disposal for damage
stock was taken. It is stated by the applicant that the stock damage report dated 01.02.2016 is
prepared by HUMS & Associates. Vide Board Resolution, HUMS & Associates were appointed as
Internal Auditors and therefore when the report of 01.02.2016 was prepared, the applicant was not
an Internal Auditor of SBFL. The only way by which the applicant is connected with this report is
one unsigned minutes of meeting dated 10.02.2016 wherein the applicant was a special invitee.
Assuming unsigned minutes can be relied upon, there is nothing to show that the applicant was
involved in any way in making false report dated 01.02.2016.
27. The next allegation is that applicant is the person who was making false stock report and
submitting to banks and obtaining loans (which on the basis of true stock reports, the company
would not have obtained). The applicant submits that there is not a single stock statement has been
signed by the applicant. The only document signed by the applicant is a stock receivable audit report
as on 31.12.2014. The stock audit report is neither by the applicant nor signed by him but in fact is of
an independently appointed stock Auditor. In the entire stock audit report, there is only one
document Signature Not Verified ARORA Signing Date:08.02.2023 12:07:41 signed by the
applicant. There is nothing else which has been signed by the applicant.
Submissions by the ED:
Mr. Zoheb Hossain, Ld. standing counsel for the ED states as under:
A. Active involvement of the Applicant
28. The respondent submits that that the applicant was an internal auditor of SBFL and was actively
involved in creation and projection of the Signature Not Verified ARORA Signing Date:08.02.2023
12:07:41 inflated financials which involved dummy entities. The respondents have stated that from
the perusal of the bank account No.010100063801 of Indraprastha Sehkari Bank Ltd., it would be
clear that the said bank account was opened on 01.06.2011. The transactions in this bank account
were made only on 20.12.2011, but, SBFL falsely reflected cheque payments through this bank
account w.e.f. 03.04.2011 i.e., several months prior to opening and actual operation of the account.
Prior to December 20, 2011, all transactions through this account were purely fictional entries.
Additionally, this account reflects most of the transactions of SBFL with dummy entities to inflate its

9
financials and which ultimately led to the commission of the offence of money laundering. . Since
the applicant had audited the business and verified the false accounting entries in the company's
books of accounts, the applicant thus played an active role in the commission of the offence.
B. The applicant was beneficiary of the proceeds of crime
29. The respondent submits that the applicant had two main firms namely (i)Raman Bhuraria &
Associates, which was a CA firm engaged by SBFL for internal audit and by group companies as
statutory auditor, and
(ii) Bhuraria Consultants Pvt Ltd. In addition to receiving cash in the amount of Rs. 6.14 Crore, the
applicant, his firm, and company also received proceeds of crime (PoC) worth Rs. 8.47 Crore, which
are PoC obtained by aiding SBFL and its directors in commission of offence.
30. Additionally, the applicant was involved in the projection of a fictitious and false stock position
as well as other SBFL financial data to consortium banks. He managed bank officials' visits for stock
verification. Email correspondence from the applicant, dated 20.10.2011, which was Signature Not
Verified ARORA Signing Date:08.02.2023 12:07:41 discovered during the investigation, showed
that he was involved in stock and related bank verification/audit matters. In this email, the
Applicant has stated :
"As discussed with Mr. Tarun yesterday is not stock audit. It is just quarterly visit of
bank to be conducted by outside agency, assigned to a CA firm on panel. Not Full
Stock Audit. Nothing to vary (worry) and to be complied till November."
31. The respondent submits that this email clearly shows the involvement of applicant in stocks of
SBFL. This email when was confronted with employee of SBFL in his statement recorded u/s 50 of
PMLA, 2002, stated that SBFL did not have the stock that it had claimed to have to lender banks.
Furthermore, he claimed that SBFL was involved in paper transactions that were carried out on
applicant's advise and that the applicant was fully aware that SBFL's stocks were inflated and that
the company did not actually own the stocks it had claimed to have to lender banks. In another
email exchanged between applicant and Abdul Hasan Ansari, list of Godowns of Rice and Wheat
mentioning details of owner and address of Godowns of SBFL were exchanged
32. The applicant was also involved in preparing inflated financial documents of SBFL for enhancing
loan from consortium banks. C. Statements made u/s 50 PMLA divulges the role of the applicant
33. The facts regarding involvement and role of the applicant in the offence of money laundering
have been divulged by the following people in their statements u/s 50 of the PMLA:

34. The respondent states that since statements are u/s 50 PMLA, the aforesaid statements, by
virtue of section 50, are admissible in evidence as also held by the Hon'ble Supreme Court and
sufficient to reject bail as held in Rohit Tandon vs. Directorate of Enforcement (2018) 11 SCC 46.
Further, the challenge to the said provision i.e., Section 50 of the PMLA has been dismissed by the
Hon€ble Supreme Court upholding the validity of the said provision in its latest decision in the case
of Vijay Madanlal Chaudhary & Signature Not Verified ARORA Signing Date:08.02.2023 12:07:41
Ors. vs. Union of India & Ors. 2022 SCC OnLine SC 929. D. Other material alleging the role of the
applicant
35. The respondent also submits that the averment of the applicant accused that there is no material
apart from statements in the present case is incorrect. There is also other material recovered against
the applicant. This material placed on record is sufficient to persuade this Hon€ble Court that no
satisfaction, as required u/s 45 of the PMLA, can be reached i. The statement of Sh. Abdul Hasan
Ansari is corroborated by the email correspondence dated 02.12.2015 between applicant and Abdul
Hasan Ansari (with copy to CMD and Siddharth Kumar) by which applicant had demanded
documents of the group companies. ii. Evidences show that applicant was directly involved in
arranging fake bills from entry operators like Devki Nandan Garg. While analysing the seized
material, an email had been recovered from email correspondence between applicant and Abdul
Hasan Ansari which contains the details of payments made by SBFL to the dummy entries operated
by Devki Nandan Garg. iii. SBFL booked some fake transactions in its books of accounts. From a
perusal of the bank account no. 010100063801 of Indraprastha Sehkari Bank Ltd., it has been
observed that the said bank account was made only on 20.12.2011. But, SBFL falsely reflected

11
cheque payments through this bank account w.e.f. 03.04.2011 i.e., several months prior to opening
and actual operation of the account. All the transactions made through this account before
20.12.2011 were nothing but fictitious entries.
Signature Not Verified ARORA Signing Date:08.02.2023 12:07:41 iv. Audit report dated 31.12.2014
signed by RG Sharma, Stock Auditor, which states that 100% accounting supervision/feedback is
provided by internal auditor. Investigation revealed that applicant was responsible for managing
and control of affairs of SBFL. v. A table showing details of closing stock as on 31.12.2014 was
received from the lender bank i.e., State Bank of India and the said document reflects the inflated
and fictitious stock position which was submitted to the lender bank for availing loan facility. This
document was signed by applicant.
E. Validity of the retracted statements
36. The reliance placed by the accused applicant on the fact that Devki Nandan Garg, Entry
Operator, has retracted his statement, is liable to be rejected as it is submitted that the statements of
Devki Nandan Garg were recorded on 05.07.2021, 08.07.2021, 10.07.2021, 12.07.2021, 13.07.202
24.07.2021, 23.08.2021, 18.09.2021, 20.09.2021, 21.09.2021, 22.09.2021, 23.09.2021, 24.09.2021,
25.09.2021, 26.09.2021, 27.09.2021, 28.09.2021 & 29.09.2021 and Devki Nandan Garg filed an
application for retraction on 15.12.2021. The respondent contends that Devki Nandan Garg was
arrested by the ED on 21.09.2021, produced before the Ld. Special Court, PMLA on 21.09.2021
when the Ld. Court remanded him to ED custody. Remand was then further extended till
24.09.2021 and thereafter Devki Nandan Garg was remanded to judicial custody on 29.09.2021.
Judicial custody was extended from time to time on 26.10.2021, 09.11.2021, 23.11.2021 and despite
all these opportunities, no allegation of any coercion was raised by Devki Nandan Garg and this
itself strikes at the credibility of the retraction application This court in Dayawanti v. Commissioner
of Income Signature Not Verified ARORA Signing Date:08.02.2023 12:07:41 Tax, 2016 SCC OnLine
Del 5772 has held as under:
"19. The nature of the books included katchaparchas, papers containing calculations
and amounts routed to bank accounts of various members of the family, sums
receivable towards business, etc. They also included documents relating to purchase
of property. The statements were made under oath on 18-04-2006 and 03-05-2006.
No doubt, they were not during the course of search. Yet, they were made voluntarily.
There was no allegation ever that the assessee or any of her family members,
including Abhay and Varun Gupta, who made the main statements under oath, were
pressurized to do so; there was in fact no contemporaneous retraction. Indeed, the
assessee appears to have resiled from the statement, only through the returns, filed
after receipt of notice under Section 153A. The probative value of these statements is
to be seen not from only whether it was allowed to stand, or whether it was resiled
from. The stage when such statement is resiled, whether the assessee was able to give
any explanation for the statement, its connection with the material seized, all are
relevant, in the opinion of the court, to judge if it is to be considered in an
assessment. In other words, there cannot be a rule carved in stone, as it were, that
Raman Bhuraria vs Directorate Of Enforcement on 8 February, 2023
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/62003795/
12
statements that are resiled cannot be considered at all..."
37. With regards to the statements being identical and hence tutored is incorrect and liable to be
dismissed. As submitted during the course of arguments that statements or the said persons were
again recorded by the Signature Not Verified ARORA Signing Date:08.02.2023 12:07:41 ED in their
own handwriting and all of them have stated in their subsequent statements that the previous
statements were given voluntarily.
38. The reliance placed by the applicant on decisions to state that bail should be granted in the
present case as trial is likely to take time are not applicable. As it is submitted that the Hon€ble
Supreme Court has taken a view that mere long incarceration in jail would not be per se illegal and
has further held that in case the accused has committed the offence, he is bound to stay behind bars.
Such detention in jail even as an undertrial prisoner, there being a provision for bail, through
restricted, is not violative of Article 21 of the Constitution. Even the three Judge Bench of the
Hon'ble Supreme Court in Vijay Madanlal (supra), while upholding the mandatory twin conditions
for grant of bail u/s 45 of the PMLA, has held that the right of bail arises at the stage of Section 436A
Cr.P.C.
39. The respondent finally submits that the economic offences in itself are considered to be gravest
offence against the society at large and hence are required to be treated differently in the matter of
bail. It is submitted that the hon€ble courts have successively held that the entire Community is
aggrieved if the economic offenders who ruin the economy of the State are not brought to book as
such offences affects the very fabric of democratic governance and probity in public life.
Analysis
40. I have heard the learned counsels for the parties.
41. At this juncture, it is imperative to have an overview of the PMLA, post the Vijay Madan
lal(supra) case. The three Judge Bench decision of the Hon€ble Supreme Court in its recent decision
in the case of Vijay Madanlal Signature Not Verified ARORA Signing Date:08.02.2023 12:07:41
Chaudhary (supra) and connected matters, has upheld the mandatory twin conditions u/s 45 of the
PMLA.
42. The PMLA is a special statute. If a person is charged under the PMLA, he has to overcome the
twin conditions of Section 45(1)(ii) of PMLA. Section 45 (1)(ii) reads as under:
"(ii) where the Public Prosecutor opposes the application, the court is satisfied that
there are reasonable grounds for believing that he is not guilty of such offence and
that he is not likely to commit any offence while on bail:
Provided that a person who is under the age of sixteen years or is a woman or is sick
or infirm, may be released on bail, if the special court so directs:
Raman Bhuraria vs Directorate Of Enforcement on 8 February, 2023
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/62003795/
13
Provided further that the Special Court shall not take cognizance of any offence
punishable under section 4 except upon a complaint in writing made by--
(i) the Director; or
(ii) any officer of the Central Government or State Government authorised in writing
in this behalf by the Central Government by a general or a special order made in this
behalf by that Government."
43. The twin conditions, are independent of each other and require the Court to weigh each one of
them and adjudicate on the potential guilt of the offender based on the material relied upon by the
accused and the opposition made to the same by the prosecution.
Signature Not Verified ARORA Signing Date:08.02.2023 12:07:41
44. Hence the Hon'ble Court is not required to render a finding of guilt or acquittal at this stage, nor
is it required to conduct a mini trial or meticulously examine the evidence but rather is to examine
whether the applicant has made out reasonable grounds for believing that he is not guilty. In Union
of India vs. Rattan Mallik (2009) 2 SCC 624, while dealing with section 37 of the NDPS, which
similar to the section 45 PMLA, the Hon€ble Supreme Court observed;
"14. We may, however, hasten to add that while considering an application for bail
with reference to Section 37 of the NDPS Act, the court is not called upon to record a
finding of "not guilty". At this stage, it is neither necessary nor desirable to weigh the
evidence meticulously to arrive at a positive finding as to whether or not the accused
has committed offence under the NDPS Act. What is to be seen is whether there is
reasonable ground for believing that the accused is not guilty of the offence(s) he is
charged with and further that he is not likely to commit an offence under the said Act
while on bail. The satisfaction of the court about the existence of the said twin
conditions is for a limited purpose and is confined to the question of releasing the
accused on bail."
45. After Vijay Madanlal (supra) case, it is clear that this court is not to go into the conclusive guilt
or innocence of the accused but base its finding on a prima facie test.
Signature Not Verified ARORA Signing Date:08.02.2023 12:07:41 I. Prima Facie no reasonable
grounds for believing that the applicant is guilty
46. The applicant is not named in the FIR. The applicant is also not named as an accused in the
ECIR registered by the ED, as the same is simply a replica of the FIR registered by the CBI.
47. The role assigned to the applicant is mentioned in the arrest memo dated 13.08.2021. The arrest
memo alleged as under:
Raman Bhuraria vs Directorate Of Enforcement on 8 February, 2023
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/62003795/
14
"9. Allegations: He has directly or indirectly attempted to indulge, knowingly assisted
and is involved in the process and activities connected with the proceeds of crime
which includes its concealment, possession, acquisition and use and projecting it as
untainted property thereby committing the offence of money laundering."
48. Hence the role assigned to the Applicant is that since he was an Internal Auditor of SBFL and
statutory auditor of several sister concerns of SBFL, it was through his aid and assistance that Shakti
Bhog Foods Limited, borrowed, layered and siphoned off the loan funds using the platform of about
24 known group companies and several shell entities. It is also alleged that he was directly involved
in paper sale purchase transactions of SBFL without conducting any actual business transactions
which resulted in inflation of their financials. It was on the strength of these audited but falsely
inflated financials that SBFL was able to obtain loans from banks. The borrowed funds were then
channelized through the bank accounts of several Shakti Bhog group entities which had actually
provided a platform for changing the colour of the borrowed funds from liabilities to assets and
then, for siphoning off the same by creating a web of complex transactions Signature Not Verified
ARORA Signing Date:08.02.2023 12:07:41 leading to commission of the offence of money
laundering. The applicant was auditor of several group companies during the period when offence
took place. For this purpose, he received the commission in form of fees and hence is involved in the
offence of money laundering.
49. The timeline of the applicant with SBFL is reproduced hereinbelow:
50. As is clear from the above, the applicant was not the statutory auditor at the time of the
commission of offence i.e., the period between 2013 and 2017.
51. The ED has alleged that the applicant was the mastermind of the whole operation and to prove
the same the ED has produced evidence in form of some emails and statements of management and
employees of SBFL given u/s 50 of the PMLA.
52. The categorical allegations against the applicant are as follows:
A. It is alleged that the applicant has an important role in disposal of alleged
damaged inventory (decision of which was taken in meeting dated 10.02.2016 when
he was participating in the meeting of the board of directors as a special invitee).
These minutes of meeting were confronted to the applicant during the course of his
statement given u/s 50 of PMLA, 2002. Further, minutes of the meeting of the
consortium Signature Not Verified ARORA Signing Date:08.02.2023 12:07:41 banks
shows that applicant also presented the case of SBFL before the consortium of banks.
He was also part of the meeting of the board of directors which decided disposal of
falsely claimed damaged stock. The applicant contends that no reliance can be made
on the unsigned minutes of Board Meeting dated 10.02.2016. In my opinion, prima
facie, it does not transpire from the above documents that the applicant actually
attended the meeting. Since there is no attendance sheet placed on record, there is no
convincing document to show his attendance. Moreover, these are unsigned and
Raman Bhuraria vs Directorate Of Enforcement on 8 February, 2023
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/62003795/
15
unstamped minutes and hence reliance on the same is at best dubious. Since the
Applicant was associated with SBFL till FY2015-16, even if the applicant attended, it
was only as a special invitee and not a proof of actual participation and decision
making. Moreover, the Stock Damage Report was prepared by M/s HUMS and
Associates who were the then internal auditors of SBFL as shown by the resolution
dated 07.09.2015 for appointment of M/s HUMS & Associates as internal auditor.
Lastly, and most importantly, even if it is assumed that the applicant was a part of the
said meeting, the minutes do not show that any decision was taken with regards to
the stocks. B. There is an email dated 08.01.2016 which underlines the role of the
Applicant in arranging fake bills from entry operators and banks made payments for
devolved LCs directly to the entry operators. Applicant was confronted with the
Email dt. 08.01.2016.
A perusal of the concerned Mail shows that it was sent by Mr. Anshu Gautam (SBFL Employee) to
AH Ansari @ Pathak. Applicant was only copied along with other persons. The email does not again
not Signature Not Verified ARORA Signing Date:08.02.2023 12:07:41 directly or indirectly point to
the guilt of the applicant as he was only copied in the email. The applicant was neither the originator
not the original primary recipient.
C. Applicant used to operate shell companies from his office building. Prima facie no documentary
material on record to show that Applicant was involved in creation or operation of these companies.
D. Applicant used to stock the godown in such a manner that it could not be accessed which made
physical verification impossible. Again, prima facie, the ED has not provided any documentary proof
to show that the applicant was engaged in decision making involving the stocking the godowns. In
addition, the applicant has provided extracts of the Fire & Burglary Risk Based Inspection Report
which were in power and possession of the respondent along with photographs of godowns wherein
stocks can be seen to be clearly accessible and visible.
E. ED€s allegation regarding Proceeds of Crime: Applicant received Rs. 14.61 Crores (Rs. 6.14 Crs.
Cash Deposits + Rs 8.47 Crs. in Banks Accounts).
Admittedly, the applicant conducted statutory audit for the year FY 2006-07 and internal auditor
for 2007-8 to 2013-14 and being the professional auditor, the applicant was entitled to charge a
professional fee. Hence, the amount in the bank accounts is legitimate professional fee received by
Applicant from SBFL and group companies for his audit related work & other consultancy. All the
Professional fees received by the Applicant has duly been disclosed, audited and all applicable taxes
were paid. The respondent€s case is not that the Signature Not Verified ARORA Signing
Date:08.02.2023 12:07:41 Applicant did not render professional services to SBFL & group concerns.
Prima facie this is a plausible explanation. This is especially so, since during investigation, no cash
or undisclosed assets recovered from Applicant and his family.
Moreover, immovable properties, bank accounts, bank lockers and other assets of Applicant and his
family stand seized, frozen or attached by the ED. Hence, the alienation of alleged Proceeds of Crime
is not possible. As regard the cash deposits, the applicant has stated that the same is result of cash
Raman Bhuraria vs Directorate Of Enforcement on 8 February, 2023
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/62003795/
16
withdraws and less expenditure over a substantial over period of time. The explanation for the cash
deposits given by the applicant i.e., the excess cash withdrawal was redeposited in the account is
plausible and gains even more significance in view of the fact that they have withstood the scrutiny
of income tax department. F. The ED has placed Emails Correspondence along with attachments,
between Applicant and Abdul Hassan Ansari containing details of payments made by SBFL to
alleged dummy entities operated by Devki Nandan Garg. The emails are challenged by the applicant
on the ground that the documents attached are not attachments to the said email. The email was
confronted to the Applicant and signed on 15.08.2021 during investigation, however, the
attachments pertain to some different email confronted to the Applicant on 12.08.2021. Further, the
actual email attachments would pertain to bank advices for LC Discounting in September, 2015 (as
can be seen from the email), however, the attachments shown by the ED relate to Lakshmi Vilas
Bank for the FY 2012-13.
Signature Not Verified ARORA Signing Date:08.02.2023 12:07:41 Since the veracity of the contents
of these emails have been denied and there is a plausible explanation given by the applicant, these
emails cannot be the factum which cliches the guilt of the applicant. Moreover, the veracity of these
emails and their relevance can only be examined after detailed evidence is led.
G. The other documents relied by the ED are the relevant parts of the books of accounts of SBFL
viz-a-viz the relevant Bank Account Statement. SBFL booked some fake transactions in its books of
accounts. From a perusal of the bank account no. 010100063801 of Indraprastha Sehkari Bank Ltd.,
it has been observed that the said bank account was made only on 20.12.2011. But, SBFL falsely
reflected cheque payments through this bank account w.e.f. 03.04.2011 i.e., several months prior to
opening and actual operation of the account. All the transactions made through this account before
20.12.2011 were nothing but fictitious entries.
I am of the view that even if these documents are considered to be true, prima facie, these
documents do not disclose as to how the Applicant was involved in creation of these documents or
routing of funds. The ED has also not been able to prima facie show excepts averments show that
the applicant was directly involved in the creation of these documents or the entries.
H. The last document on which reliance is being placed by the ED to bring home the guilt of the
applicant, is the audit report dated 31.12.2014 signed by RG Sharma, Stock Auditor, which states
that 100% accounting supervision/feedback is provided by internal auditor. It is further alleged
applicant was responsible for managing and control Signature Not Verified ARORA Signing
Date:08.02.2023 12:07:41 of affairs of SBFL.
A table showing details of closing stock as on 31.12.2014 was received from the lender bank i.e.,
State Bank of India and the said document reflects the inflated and fictitious stock position which
was submitted to the lender bank for availing loan facility. This document is signed by the applicant.
Although this document shows inflated stock position which was signed by the applicant, a bare
perusal of the report will prima facie make it clear that the Physical Stock Verification was the job of
the RG Sharma & Co., an Independent Stock Auditor appointed by SBI. The ED has not placed any
material on record to show that this document forming part of the Stock Receivables Report was in

any manner incorrect or false. Assuming that it is false, there is no explanation offered by the ED as
to why the stock auditor of the bank has not been made an accused. Moreover, the signatures of the
Applicant were the requirement of the Banks to the effect that the financial documents for yearend
31.12.2014 be signed by a CA (preferably Internal Auditor).
53. In this view of the matter, the aforesaid documents do not support the contention of the ED that
the applicant is guilty. Heavy reliance has been placed on section 50 of PMLA statements made by
the employees of the SBFL. The only relevant document remaining that prima facie may establish
the guilt are the statements u/s 50 of the PMLA.The investigation of the ED is hinged on the
statements made u/s 50 of the employees of the SBFL.
54. In Vijay Madanlal (supra), the Hon€ble Supreme Court has observed as follows:
Signature Not Verified ARORA Signing Date:08.02.2023 12:07:41 "431. In the context of the 2002
Act, it must be remembered that the summon is issued by the Authority under Section 50 in
connection with the inquiry regarding proceeds of crime which may have been attached and pending
adjudication before the Adjudicating Authority. In respect of such action, the designated officials
have been empowered to summon any person for collection of information and evidence to be
presented before the Adjudicating Authority. It is not necessarily for initiating a prosecution against
the noticee as such. The power entrusted to the designated officials under this Act, though couched
as investigation in real sense, is to undertake inquiry to ascertain relevant facts to facilitate initiation
of or pursuing with an action regarding proceeds of crime, if the situation so warrants and for being
presented before the Adjudicating Authority. It is a different matter that the information and
evidence so collated during the inquiry made, may disclose commission of offence of
money-laundering and the involvement of the person, who has been summoned for making
disclosures pursuant to the summons issued by the Authority. At this stage, there would be no
formal document indicative of likelihood of involvement of such person as an accused of offence of
money- laundering. If the statement made by him reveals the offence of money-laundering or the
existence of proceeds of crime, that becomes actionable under the Act itself. To put it differently, at
the stage of recording of statement for the purpose of inquiring into the relevant facts in connection
with the property being proceeds of crime is, in that sense, not an investigation for prosecution as
such;
Signature Not Verified ARORA Signing Date:08.02.2023 12:07:41 and in any case, there would be
no formal accusation against the noticee. Such summons can be issued even to witnesses in the
inquiry so conducted by the authorised officials. However, after further inquiry on the basis of other
material and evidence, the involvement of such person (noticee) is revealed, the authorised officials
can certainly proceed against him for his acts of commission or omission. In such a situation, at the
stage of issue of summons, the person cannot claim protection under Article 20(3) of the
Constitution. However, if his/her statement is recorded after a formal arrest by the ED official, the
consequences of Article 20(3) or Section 25 of the Evidence Act may come into play to urge that the
same being in the nature of confession, shall not be proved against him. Further, it would not
preclude the prosecution from proceeding against such a person including for consequences under
Section 63 of the 2002 Act on the basis of other tangible material to indicate the falsity of his claim.
Raman Bhuraria vs Directorate Of Enforcement on 8 February, 2023

18
That would be a matter of rule of evidence.
444. ..The third aspect which had weighed with the Court in Tofan Singh692 is that the police officer
investigating an offence under the NDPS Act, the provisions of Sections 161 to 164 of the 1973 Code
as also Section 25 of the Evidence Act, would come into play making the statement made before
them by the accused as inadmissible. Whereas, the investigation into the same offence was to be
done by the designated officer under the NDPS Act, the safeguards contained in Sections 161 to 164
of the 1973 Code and Section 25 of the Evidence Act, will have no application and the Signature Not
Verified ARORA Signing Date:08.02.2023 12:07:41 statement made before them would be
inadmissible in evidence. This had resulted in discrimination. No such situation emerges from the
provisions of the 2002 Act. Whereas, the 2002 Act clearly authorises only the authorities under the
2002 Act referred to in Section 48 to step in and summon the person when occasion arises and
proceed to record the statement and take relevant documents on record. For that, express provision
has been made authorising them to do so and by a legal fiction, deemed it to be a statement
recorded in a judicial proceeding by virtue of Section 50(4) of the 2002 Act. A regular police officer
will neither be in a position to take cognizance of the offence of money-laundering, much less be
permitted to record the statement which is to be made part of the proceeding before the
Adjudicating Authority under the 2002 Act for confirmation of the provisional attachment order
and confiscation of the proceeds of crime for eventual vesting in the Central Government. That may
entail in civil consequences. It is a different matter that some material or evidence is made part of
the complaint if required to be filed against the person involved in the process or activity connected
with money-laundering so as to prosecute him for offence punishable under Section 3 of the 2002
Act. The next point which has been reckoned by this Court in the said decision is that in the
provisions of NDPS Act, upon culmination of investigation of crime by a designated officer under
that Act (other than a Police Officer), he proceeds to file a complaint; but has no authority to further
investigate the offence, if required. Whereas, if the same offence was investigated by a Signature Not
Verified ARORA Signing Date:08.02.2023 12:07:41 regular Police Officer after filing of the police
report under Section 173(2) of the 1973 Code, he could still do further investigation by invoking
Section 173(8) of the 1973 Code. This, on the face of it, was discriminatory."
55. The Supreme Court, thus, clarified that the statements made u/s 50 are admissible evidence.
However, these statements are now retracted as follows:
‚  Shri Kewal Krishna Kumar dated 28.08.2021 [Founder and Managing Director of
SBFL].
‚  Shri Devki Nandan Garg Retraction dated 14.12.2021 [Accommodation Entry
Operator].
‚  Shri Ashok Kumar Goel Retraction dated 10.04.2022 [Accommodation Entry
Operator].
‚  Shri Tarun Kumar has also filed Retraction dated 14.07.2022 (Key Managerial
Personnel and also Nephew of Promoter - Kewal Krishan Kumar). (Arrested on

19
22.06.2022) ‚  Shri Sidharth Kumar has also filed Retraction dated 06.08.2022 (Key
Managerial Personnel and also Son of Promoter - Kewal Krishan Kumar). (Arrested
on 22.06.2022).
56. Hence, the question which I am confronted with is not whether these retracted statements are
admissible but whether these retracted statements are reliable? At this stage, I have to see the
reliability of these retracted statements in the facts and circumstances of this case.
57. The reliability of the retracted statements has been discussed by the Signature Not Verified
ARORA Signing Date:08.02.2023 12:07:41 division bench of this court Central Excise v. Vishnu &
Co. Pvt. Ltd., 2015 SCC OnLine Del 13824:
"40. In fact Ms. Sharma too insisted upon reading from such retracted statements in
order to persuade the Court to hold that the impugned order of the CESTAT is
perverse. According to her the retraction made more than 20 months after the
making of the initial statements "would have no effect in the eye of law". She too
submitted that the responsibility of ensuring the presence of such persons for
cross-examination was of the noticees themselves.
41. What the above submission overlooks is the „reliability€ of such statements. Once
it is shown that the maker of such statement has in fact resiled from it, even if it is
after a period of time, then it is no longer safe to rely upon it as a substantive piece of
evidence. The question is not so much as to admissibility of such statement as much
as it is about its „reliability€. It is the latter requirement that warrants a judicial
authority to seek, as a rule of prudence, some corroboration of such retracted
statement by some other reliable independent material. This is the approach adopted
by the CESTAT and the Court finds it to be in consonance with the settled legal
position in this regard."
58. In the present case as well, the question is not regarding the admissibility but the reliability. The
statements had concretely named the applicant. However, in their subsequent retraction the
reliability of the statements themselves become doubtful. Statements of Employees of SBFL,
Accommodation Entry Operators (Devki Nandan Garg & Ashok Kumar Signature Not Verified
ARORA Signing Date:08.02.2023 12:07:41 Goel) are a cut copy paste job with even the punctation
marks of commas, full stops not differing.
59. Prima facie in view of the retraction, the reliability of these statements is questionable. The
retracted statements cannot form the basis of the guilt of the applicant of the offences as alleged.
Prima facie, I find it difficult to place the guilt of the offence under PMLA on the applicant, based on
these statements. Further, the questions as to why the statements were retracted are questions of
trial.
60. The ED has placed reliance on Rohit Tandon v. Directorate of Enforcement, (2018) 11 SCC 46
and submitted that Economic Offences are to be treated on a different footing since economic
Raman Bhuraria vs Directorate Of Enforcement on 8 February, 2023
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/62003795/
20
offences have deep- rooted conspiracies and involve huge loss of public funds which need to be
viewed seriously and considered as grave offences affecting the economy of the country as a whole
and thereby posing serious threat to the financial health of the country.
61. The observation of the Supreme Court is binding on this court. However, in Rohit Tandon
(supra), the facts were different. For one, the primary reason for dismissal of bail was availability of
documentary evidence against the Applicant therein and recovery of huge amount of unaccounted
cash for which no explanation could be provided as noted by the Hon€ble Supreme Court.
Moreover, in Rohit Tandon was subsequently granted bail 5 months thereafter by this Hon€ble
Court in "Raj Kumar Goel v. Directorate of Enforcement, 2018 SCC OnLine Del 8873, reported as
2018 SCC OnLine Del 8873 "25. Thus the major change which is required to be considered by this
Court as per the decision of Supreme Court in Kalyan Chandra Signature Not Verified ARORA
Signing Date:08.02.2023 12:07:41 Sarkar (supra) referred to by Additional Solicitor General in the
present case is the non-applicability of the twin conditions under Section 45 of PMLA which was the
major reason for rejection of the earlier bail application of Rohit Tandon. Second major
consideration is that the offence punishable under Section 4 PMLA provides for maximum sentence
of imprisonment for seven years with a minimum sentence for imprisonment of three years.
Petitioners have been in custody for a period of now more than one year four months and despite
directions of the Hon'ble Supreme Court vide order dated 10th November, 2017 that day-to-day trial
should continue, till date arguments on charge have not begun. As noted above in the predicate
offence, that is, FIR No. 205/2016 the Crime Branch did not even think it fit to arrest the petitioners
and filed a charge-sheet without arrest. The evidence in the present case is primarily documentary
in nature and statements of accused which are admissible in evidence have already been recorded
under Section 50 of PMLA. Further corroborative evidence in the form of CCTV footage and call
detail records is also documentary in nature. Moreover as per the requirement of Section 44 of
PMLA trials in FIR No. 205/2016 for the scheduled offence as well as Section 4 PMLA in ECIR No.
18/DLZOII/2016 are required to be held together. Hence the trial is likely to take some time. Thus,
this Court deems it fit to grant bail to the petitioners."
62. In the present case, there is no relevant document to support the allegations. Admittedly the
applicant has the 15-year association with SBFL, but despite the allegation that he was the
mastermind of the whole operation Signature Not Verified ARORA Signing Date:08.02.2023
12:07:41 the ED has relied on 5 documents to show the applicant€s complicity. For the reasons as
noted, the documents do not show that the applicant is guilty of offences as alleged against him. In
addition, there is not satisfactory explanation given by the ED for the lack of documents that directly
point to the applicant as the "mastermind."
63. In addition, the observation of the IO also assumes importance in determining whether the
applicant is prima facie not guilty. The IO in the column No.12 of the FIR, noted that the account the
SBFL was declared NPA on account of commercial reason and, more importantly, there were no
apparent mala fides in the monitoring of the account though there are some omissions/ instances of
negligence. This observation is indicative of the fact that initial investigation in the role of the
applicant had not led to a conclusive finding against the applicant.

II. Delay in filing chargesheet; Investigating still continuing:
64. In the present case, out of a possible 7-year sentence, the applicant in case has already served
more than 17 months of pre-trial detention (as of 23.01.2023). It is also important to state that the
applicant has been interrogated only once on 13.11.2021 in entire judicial custody of more than 1
year.
65. I was also apprised of the fact that even now the trial in this case has not begun. During the
arguments, the ED had sought leave of the Ld. Trial Court to file the following documents in the 4th
Prosecution:
i. additional documents, ii. additional list of witnesses, Signature Not Verified ARORA Signing
Date:08.02.2023 12:07:41 iii. further Complaints
66. In my opinion, there can be no arguments on framing charges or initiation of a trial because the
investigation is still ongoing. The ED has listed 109 witnesses till date and the Prosecution
Complaints run into lakhs of pages in multiple trunks. Without a completion of investigation, no
charges can be framed nor can trial cannot begin. In the light of this, the court cannot let the
applicant undergo long period of detention. If this court allows the continuing pre-trial
incarceration, the same will amount to deprivation of personal liberty as well as travesty of justice as
the same is equivalent to punishment without trial.
67. In Vijay Madanlal (supra) as well the Hon€ble supreme Court, also upheld the sentiment of
unjustified detention. The Hon€ble SC observed that:
"416. The Union of India also recognized the right to speedy trial and access to justice
as fundamental right in their written submissions and, thus, submitted that in a
limited situation right of bail can be granted in case of violation of Article 21 of the
Constitution...
417. Be that as it may, in our opinion, this provision is comparable with the statutory bail provision
or, so to say, the default bail, to be granted in terms of Section 167 of the 1973 Code consequent to
failure of the investigating agency to file the chargesheet within the statutory period and, in the
context of the 2002 Act, complaint within the specified period after arrest of the person concerned.
In the case of Section 167 of the 1973 Code, an indefeasible right is triggered in favour of the accused
the moment the investigating agency commits default in filing the chargesheet/complaint within the
statutory period. The provision in the form of Section 436A of the 1973 Code, as has now come into
being is in recognition of the Signature Not Verified ARORA Signing Date:08.02.2023 12:07:41
constitutional right of the accused regarding speedy trial under Article 21 of the Constitution. For, it
is a sanguine hope of every accused, who is in custody in particular, that he/she should be tried
expeditiously -- so as to uphold the tenets of speedy justice. If the trial cannot proceed even after the
accused has undergone one-half of the maximum period of imprisonment provided by law, there is
no reason to deny him this lesser relief of considering his prayer for release on bail or bond, as the
case may be, with appropriate conditions, including to secure his/her presence during the trial.

418. Learned Solicitor General was at pains to persuade us that this view would impact the
objectives of the 2002 Act and is in the nature of super imposition of Section 436A of the 1973 Code
over Section 45 of the 2002 Act. He has also expressed concern that the same logic may be invoked
in respect of other serious offences, including terrorist offences which would be counterproductive.
So be it. We are not impressed by this submission. For, it is the constitutional obligation of the State
to ensure that trials are concluded expeditiously and at least within a reasonable time where strict
bail provisions apply. If a person is detained for a period extending up to one-half of the maximum
period of imprisonment specified by law and is still facing trial, it is nothing short of failure of the
State in upholding the constitutional rights of the citizens, including person accused of an offence."
68. In the present case, although the applicant, has not undergone half of the period, the offence
with which the applicant is charged with is punishable with imprisonment upto 7 years but not with
life or death. There are no criminal antecedents reported against the applicant. Out of this sentence,
the applicant has already undergone 17 months of incarceration
69. Even though the allegations are serious but the chargesheet is yet to be filed. Assuming that the
applicant was the mastermind, the respondent Signature Not Verified ARORA Signing
Date:08.02.2023 12:07:41 did not name him in the original FIR. The applicant had conducted audit
of the company and had certified the fictitious accounting entries in the books of accounts of the
company to inflate financials of SBFL, even then during his entire custody he has been interrogated
only on one occasion on 13.11.2021.
70. The period of incarceration as well as the delay in investigation along with any reliable material
which directly involved the Applicant justifies a prima facie release on bail. The only substantial
evidence which is produced are the statements u/s 50 PMLA which too have been retracted.
71. These statements u/s 50 PMLA do not in my opinion, prima facie establish that the applicant
was the mastermind of the whole operation.
72. With regards to the apprehension on the part of the prosecution of tampering with the evidence
and threatening the witnesses can be taken care of by imposing stringent conditions. The CBI may
proceed with the investigation but not at the cost of continued incarceration of the applicant.
73. The standing counsel for the ED has been given the opportunity to oppose the bail. Hence the
twin conditions as enumerated u/s 45 of PMLA have been met.
74. Having regard to the totality of the circumstances, in my opinion, the applicant should be
released on bail. The application is, therefore, allowed in terms of the following conditions:
(a) The applicant shall furnish a personal bond in the sum of Rs. 50,000/-
(Rupees fifty Thousand Only) each with 01 surety in the like amount, to the satisfaction of the trial
Court;

the same to the trial Court;
Signature Not Verified ARORA Signing Date:08.02.2023 12:07:41
(c) The applicant shall furnish to the IO/SHO concerned his cellphone number on which the
applicant may be contacted at any time and shall ensure that the number is kept active and
switched-on at all times;
(d) The applicant shall drop a Google pin location from his mobile phone to the IO concerned which
shall be kept operational throughout his bail;
(e) The applicant shall not indulge in any act or omission that is unlawful, illegal or that would
prejudice the proceedings in pending cases, if any;
(f) The applicant shall join investigation as and when directed by the IO and will appear in court as
and when required;
75. Nothing stated hereinabove shall tantamount to an expression of opinion on the merits of the
case.
76. The application along with pending application(s), if any, are disposed of accordingly.
