 JUDGMENT (Per G.S. Kulkarni, J.)
Godrej Properties Ltd vs The State Of Maharashtra Thr. ... on 3 May, 2023
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/24293798/

1. Rule. Rule made returnable forthwith. Respondents waive service. By consent of the parties, heard
finally.
2. This batch of petitions raise common issues of law and facts, hence can be conveniently disposed
of by this common judgment.
3. The conspectus of facts, which are not in dispute are required to be stated:
The City and Industrial Development Corporation (for short "CIDCO") is impleaded as a respondent
in all these petitions. CIDCO issued public tenders sometime in February, 2021 inviting bids for
allotment of residential- cum-commercial plots of land at Navi Mumbai. Such plots offered for
allotment, were plots belonging to and/or vested with the CIDCO. The petitioners participated in the
different public tenders as invited by CIDCO. The petitioners were successful allottees qua the plots
as alloted to them by the CIDCO and subject matter of the present proceedings. In participating in
such tenders, each of the petitioners have deposited with CIDCO substantial amounts, as earnest
money deposit, later to be adjusted in the total consideration to be paid by them, namely, the lease
premium to be paid to the CIDCO. The first instalment of the lease premium was to be paid in four
weeks from the date of allotment and the second instalment after six weeks 3 May, 2023
WP2473_2021.DOC from the payment of first instalment. Thus, within ten weeks, the total amount
of lease premium was required to be deposited by the petitioners with the CIDCO.
4. Before the petitioners could deposit the first instalment of lease premium with the CIDCO, under
their respective allotments, clouds of uncertainty hovered in relation to these plots of land allotted
to the petitioners, on account of actions being resorted by the Navi Mumbai Municipal Corporation
(for short "NMMC"), namely, that it was proposed by the NMMC that these plots of land, which
were allotted to the petitioners shall be subjected to reservation for different public purposes. It is
not necessary to delve into details of such public purpose for which the plots were proposed to be
reserved, suffice it to observe, that such issue of reservation being asserted by the Municipal
Corporation and the same being resisted by the CIDCO was subject matter of litigation before this
Court in Public Interest Litigation No. 22 of 2021 in case of Nishant Karsan Bhagat & Ors.vs. City
and Industrial Development Corporation of Maharashtra Ltd. & Ors. and in Public Interest
Litigation No. 37 of 2021 in case of Mr. Sunil J. Garg & Ors. vs. State of Maharashtra & Ors.
5. Some background on such PIL proceedings can be noted. The State Government sometime in the
year 1970 conceived a plan to set up a twin city across the Mumbai harbour at the relevant time
known as "New Bombay" and 3 May, 2023 WP2473_2021.DOC now "Navi Mumbai". According to
the provisions of Section 113 of the Maharashtra Regional and Town Planning (for short "MRTP
Act") which falls in Chapter VI of the MRTP Act providing for "New Towns", specified sites came to
be designated for setting up the new town of Navi Mumbai. Sub- section (3A) came to be inserted in
Section 113 of the MRTP Act by Maharashtra Act 21 of 1971 authorizing the State Government to
constitute a New Town Development Authority. Sub-section (3A) as inserted by the said amendment
reads thus:
Godrej Properties Ltd vs The State Of Maharashtra Thr. ... on 3 May, 2023
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/24293798/

"Having regard to the complexity and magnitude of the work involved in developing
any area as a site for the new town, the time required for setting up new machinery
for undertaking and completing such work of development, and the comparative
speed with which such work can be undertaken and completed in the public interest,
if the work is done through the agency of a corporation including a company owned
or controlled by the State as a new town, the State Government may notwithstanding
anything contained in sub-section (2), require the work of developing and disposing
of land in the area of a new town to be done by any such corporation, company or
subsidiary company aforesaid, as an agent of the State Government; and thereupon,
such corporation or company shall, in relation to such area be declared by the State
Government, by notification in the Official Gazette, to be the New Town Development
Authority for that area".
6. The State Government, thereafter, issued a notification under sub- section (3A) of Section 113 of
the MRTP Act, designating CIDCO as the New Town Development Authority, for the New Bombay
area. In exercise of its authority as a New Town Development Authority, CIDCO was authorized and
empowered to develop lands as vested in it in the various nodes (areas) of Navi Mumbai and make
allotment of plots. In the year 1975, CIDCO also framed 3 May, 2023 WP2473_2021.DOC the New
Bombay Disposal of Land Regulations, 1975 for disposal of the lands, as vested with the CIDCO, for
residential and commercial uses etc. and the revenue which was received from the disposal of such
land was being utilized by CIDCO for the Planning and Development of the new town. By such
process, CIDCO developed lands for various public purposes including to provide various amenities,
by designating lands for bus depots, railways, gardens, playgrounds, airport, hospitals, commercial
establishments and residential areas. The lands vested with the CIDCO were being gradually
developed and after such development, by virtue of the powers vested with the CIDCO as a New
Town Development Authority, CIDCO at all material times, had become entitled to make allotment
of the plots by following the lawful procedure.
7. Almost after about twenty years of CIDCO being designated as the new town development
authority, the State Government by a notification dated 17 December, 1991, issued under section 3 of
the Bombay Provincial Municipal Corporation Act, 1949 (now the NMMC Act, 1949) constituted the
NMMC for the areas of 44 revenue villages as specified therein w.e.f. 1 January, 1992. The State
Government by its orders dated 15 December, 1994 and 29 July, 2008 conferred on the NMMC
powers as a "planning authority" in two phases. Thus, the NMMC also became the "planning
authority" within the meaning of Section 2(19) of the MRTP Act, in its capacity as the "local
authority" as 3 May, 2023 WP2473_2021.DOC defined under section 2(15) of the MRTP Act, that is
a Municipal Corporation as constituted under the NMMC Act, 1949.
8. Also, by a notification dated 15 December, 1994 as issued by the State Government under Section
154 of the MRTP Act, the NMMC was permitted to act as a Planning Authority in respect of the
developed nodes of Vashi, Sanpada, Belapur, Kopar-khairne and Airoli as also was empowered to
exercise all powers under Chapter III and IV of the MRTP Act. Such notification also provided that
considerable portion of land in the said areas were still to be developed and disposed of by CIDCO,
hence, in order to enable CIDCO to discharge its functions as the New Town Development
Godrej Properties Ltd vs The State Of Maharashtra Thr. ... on 3 May, 2023

Authority, it would not be necessary for CIDCO to approach the NMMC for development permission
in regard to areas of land being vested in and developed by CIDCO. Although the NMMC was
constituted and designated as Planning authority, however, the mandate and authority vested with
the CIDCO to exercise powers as the New Town Development Authority and accordingly to take all
actions in regard to the portions of land to be developed and disposed of by the CIDCO, continued to
remain in operation and subsisted with CIDCO, despite the NMMC being constituted.
9. Thus, for the Navi Mumbai area, there were two planning authorities under the MRTP Act, which
remained functional, however, under different 3 May, 2023 WP2473_2021.DOC spheres. The
original authority, being the CIDCO, with whom the functions of Planning and Development, and
preparation of the development plan for the purpose of Town Planning stood vested in the year
1980, in exercise of such powers, had prepared a "Draft Development Plan" which was submitted to
the State Government. By notification dated 18 January, 1980, the State Government, in exercise of
powers under section 31(1) of the MRTP Act, sanctioned such Draft Development Plan to be the final
development plan which was in the form of a structural plan for the New Town area to be brought
into force w.e.f. 1 March, 1980. CIDCO had accordingly continued to function as the Development
Authority on this front.
10. On 14 December, 2017, NMMC published a notification under section 23(1) of the MRTP Act
declaring its intention to prepare a draft development plan for the area under its jurisdiction.
Immediately thereafter, on 22 December, 2017 NMMC addressed a letter to the CIDCO directing
CIDCO not to sale any vacant land owned by it in view of the notification under section 23(1) of
MRTP Act. This letter was not in the public domain. On such backdrop, on 13 December, 2019, the
General Body of NMMC passed a resolution to the effect that several plots in different nodes of Navi
Mumbai be reserved for public purposes. It is pertinent that the said General Body resolution was
also not in the public domain albeit it was merely a resolution.
3 May, 2023 WP2473_2021.DOC
11. Notably, the stand of the NMMC acting under the General Body resolution dated 13 December,
2019 to the effect that the CIDCO should not allot/dispose of any vacant land owned by it, in view of
a notification published by the NMMC under section 23(1) of MRTP Act declaring its intention to
prepare a draft development plan, was not part of any of the disclosure in the tenders issued by the
CIDCO. The plots of land in respect of which CIDCO had issued tenders, in fact were sought to be
reserved by NMMC for public purposes. The petitioners obviously not aware and/or oblivious of
such stand of the NMMC, submitted their respective bids, participating in the tenders in question. It
is later on, in view of certain litigation which had come before this Court in Writ Petition No. 9283
of 2019 (Arham Developers vs. CIDCO) and in another case of Fornex Realty, who were similarly
placed like the petitioners, and who were refused development permissions and/or whose allotment
was cancelled on uncertainity created by such issue, the petitioners discovered that there were
serious issues between NMMC and CIDCO in relation to the plots being allotted to them and which
were not disclosed to the petitioners or other allotees in the tenders. It was also discovered by the
petitioners that the plots which were represented to the petitioners to be unencumbered and
freehold, were actually sought to be reserved by the NMMC for public purposes, and hence, if the

petitioners were to take forward the allotment process, there was immimently a chance that the
allotment itself would not be fruitful. This for 3 May, 2023 WP2473_2021.DOC the reason that on
one hand the petitioners would make the entire payment to the CIDCO, and in lieu thereof what
would be received by them from CIDCO are plots of land which would remain of no utility for any
commercial/ residential development for which the public bids were invited by CIDCO in which the
petitioners were successful bidders. In these circumstances, the petitioners have approached this
Court. The prayers in all these petitions are almost similar. Illustratively, we note the prayers in Writ
Petition No. 2473 of 2021 (Shelton Infrastructure Pvt. Ltd. ), which reads thus:
"a) That this Hon'ble Court be pleased to issue Writ of Mandamus or any other writ
in the nature of Mandamus or any other appropriate writ, order or direction under
Article 226 of the Constitution of India directing the respondent no. 1 to issue
directions and/or instructions, and respondent nos. 2 and 3 to follow such directions
and/or instructions, to exclude any reservation on the said plot and specify the
purpose and use of the said Plot as Residential and Commercial;
b) That this Hon'ble Court be pleased to issue a Writ of Mandamus or such other
writ(s)/order(s) and/or direction(s) in the nature of Mandamus, directing
respondent no. 3 to process/consider development permissions in respect of the said
plot, as and when applied for, in accordance with law and on the basis that the land
use of the said plot is residential and commerical;
c) That without prejudice and in the alternative to prayer clauses (a) and (b) above,
this Hon'ble Court be pleased to issue a Writ in the nature of Mandamus or such
other writ(s)/order(s) and/or direction(s) in the nature of Mandamus directing
respondent no. 2 to refund the Earnest Money Deposit, i.e., Rs.2,53,91,000/- paid by
the petitioner in respect of the said plot along with interest thereon @ 18% p.a. or at
such rate as this Hon'ble Court deems fit from the date of deposit till
refund/payment, without any deduction or adjustment or penalty;
d) That this Hon'ble Court be pleased to issue a Writ of Mandamus or such other
writ(s)/order(s) and/or direction(s) in the nature of Mandamus, directing
respondent no. 2 to amend/revise the terms of the Allotment Letter to delete Clause
G and provide for clause regarding extension of time to pay lease premium to bring it
in harmony with the provisions of the Navi Mumbai Disposal of Lands Regulations
2008;
3 May, 2023 WP2473_2021.DOC
e) That this Hon'ble Court be pleased to issue a Writ of Mandamus or such other
writ(s)/order(s) and/or directions(s) in the nature of Mandamus, directing
respondents to charge for additional FSI only in accordance with Unified
Development Control & Promotion Regulations and nothing in addition thereto;

11
f) That pending the hearing and final disposal of the instant Writ Petition, this
Hon'ble Court be pleased to direct Respondent no. 2 to suspend and/or extend the
schedule of payment stipulated at clause G of the Allotment Letter, Exhibit I hereto,
without levying on the petitioner, any interest or charges or penalty of any nature,
monetary or otherwise, and/or forfeiture and/or termination of the Allotment Letter,
Exhibit "I" hereto;
g) That pending the hearing and final disposal of the instant Writ Petition, this
Hon'ble Court be pleased to restrain respondent no. 2 from, in any manner, levying
or charging or demanding or recovering any further amount under the said Scheme
or any interest or charges or penalty monetary or otherwise, from the petitioner;
(h) That pending the hearing and final disposal of the instant Writ Petition, this
Hon'ble Court be pleased to direct Respondent no. 2 to deposit in this Hon'ble Court,
with all accrued interest thereon, an amount of Rs.2,53,91,000/- being the Earnest
Money Deposit paid by the petitioner for the said plot with necessary directions that
the said amount be invested and earn interest as the Court deems appropriate.
(I) For ad-interim reliefs in terms of prayers(f), (g) and (h) above."
12. The above Writ Petition was moved before the Court for ad-interim reliefs on 7 May, 2021 when
a co-ordinate Bench of this Court, of which one of us (G.S. Kulkarni, J.) was a member, passéd an
order granting interim protection in terms of the following order:
1. We have heard Mr. Tulzapurkar, learned senior counsel for the petitioners,
Mr.Hegde, learned counsel for the CIDCO and Mr.Marne, learned counsel for the
Navi Mumbai Municipal Corporation.
2. The petitioners in these three petitions are similarly situated. They are participants in a tender
process initiated by the CIDCO for allotment of residential-cum-commercial plots. The CIDCO has
held them eligible for such allotment. At the time of submission of their bids, the 3 May, 2023
WP2473_2021.DOC petitioners have paid substantial amounts as 'Earnest Money Deposit' and now
the allotment process has reached to a stage that the first installment of the lease premium is
required to be paid by the petitioners after some days. It is at this stage, by certain actions which are
taken by Navi Mumbai Municipal Corporation, an uncertainty has arisen qua the proposed
allotment in favour of the petitioners, for the reason that these open and free plots offered to the
petitioners, are now sought to be placed under reservation by Navi Mumbai Municipal Corporation
for public purposes.
3. The contention of the petitioners is to the effect that if the plots are now to be reserved, the entire
purpose for which the petitioners have participated in the CIDCO's tender process would stand
nullified as the petitioners would not be in a position to use the plots for the purpose of which the
allotment procedure was undertaken by the CIDCO. The petitioners intention was never to
participate in a process to seek allotment of any plots which in any manner are encumbered.
Godrej Properties Ltd vs The State Of Maharashtra Thr. ... on 3 May, 2023
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/24293798/
12
4. The petitioners have also contended that when the plots were so notified under the tender, there
was no proposal to have any reservation for the public purpose qua such plots. In fact the CIDCO
had notified that the plots shall be used only for the purposes for which they have been notified that
is for residential and commercial use.
5. On the backdrop of the controversy, the immediate urgency which has been pointed out on behalf
of the petitioners is that the first installment of the lease premium is immediately payable to the
CIDCO and if such an installment is paid and in the event the plots are declared to be under
reservation, the entire purpose of the allotment would stand nullified causing a serious prejudice
and injury to the petitioners. They have accordingly prayed for interim reliefs to postpone and/or
suspend the payment of the installment which is immediately due.
6. Considering the nature of the grievances as urged on behalf of the petitioners, we would require
the Navi Mumbai Municipal Corporation and the CIDCO to file reply affidavits and accordingly
adjourn these petitions, and while doing so grant an interim protection to the petitioners. We
accordingly adjourn the hearing of these petitions to July 13, 2021. The respondents-Corporation
and CIDCO shall file their respective reply affidavits by June 21, 2021. Rejoinder, if any, be filed by
July 05, 2021.
7. Till July 30, 2021 or until further order, whichever is earlier, there shall be ad-interim reliefs in
terms of prayer clause (f) in writ petition Nos.10294 of 2021 and 10295 of 2021 and prayer clause (i)
in writ petition No.10316 of 2021 which read thus:-
"Writ Petition Nos.10294 of 2021 and 10295 of 2021 3 May, 2023
WP2473_2021.DOC f. That pending the hearing and final disposal of the instant Writ
Petition, this Hon'ble Court be pleased to direct Respondent No.2 to suspend and/or
extend the schedule of payment stipulated at clause G of the Allotment Letter, Exhibit
I hereto, without levying on the Petitioner, any interest or charges or penalty of any
nature, monetary or otherwise, and/or forfeiture and/or termination of the Allotment
Letter, Exhibit "I" hereto."
" Writ Petition No.10316 of 2021 I. That pending the hearing and final disposal of this
Writ Petition, this Hon'ble Court be pleased to direct Respondent No.2 to extend
and/or suspend the Schedule of Payment at Clause C of the Allotment Letters,
without levying any interest or charges or penalty or late payment charges of any
nature, whatsoever on Petitioner."
(emphasis supplied)
13. Another batch of petitions with similar cause of action (Writ Petition (St.) Nos.
10617 of 2021, Writ Petiton (St.) No. 10614 of 202, Writ Petiton (St.) No. 10371 of
2021 and Writ Petition No. 1214 of 2021) were moved before the Vacation Bench of
this Court on 11 May, 2021, when following interim order was passed:
Godrej Properties Ltd vs The State Of Maharashtra Thr. ... on 3 May, 2023

"1. Heard.
2. The Petitioners are participants in a tender process initiated by the CIDCO for
allotment of residential-cumcommercial plots. The CIDCO has held them eligible for
such allotment and allotted plot nos.8 + 9, Sector 18, Sanpada, Navi Mumbai. At the
time of submission of their bids, the Petitioners have paid substantial amounts as
'Earnest Money Deposit' and now the allotment process has reached to a stage that
the frst installment of the lease premium is required to be paid by the Petitioners
after some time.
3. It is at this stage, certain actions which are taken by Navi Mumbai Municipal
Corporation, an uncertainty has arisen qua the proposed allotment in favour of the
Petitioners, for the reason that these open and free plots offered to the Petitioners,
are now sought to be placed under reservation by Navi Mumbai Municipal
Corporation for public purposes.
3 May, 2023 WP2473_2021.DOC
4. The learned Senior Counsel for the Petitioner submits that in view of these
subsequent development, they approached this Hon'ble Court to restrain the
Respondents from insisting to pay the installment of lease premium. He submits that
similar issue was before this court in Writ Petition (St.) No.10294 of 2021 Shelton
Infrastructure Pvt. Ltd. vs. State of Maharashtra through Urban Development
Department & Ors., Writ Petition (St.) No.10295 of 2021 Shelton Infrastructure Pvt.
Ltd. vs. State of Maharashtra through Urban Development Department & Ors. and
Writ Petition (St.) No.10316 of 2021 Godrej Properties Ltd. vs. State of Maharashtra
through Urban Development Department & Ors. He submits that after hearing all the
parties, this court by order dated 07.05.2021, directed Respondent CIDCO not to take
any coercive action against the Petitioners in those matters. He submits that those
three Writ Petitions are pending for hearing and fnal disposal on its own merits. He
submits that similar orders may be passed in the present proceeding so that issue can
be decided simultaneously along with other pending matters.
5. These facts are not disputed by Mr.Hegde, the learned Counsel for the appearing
for the CIDCO. He submits that there is no order from Navi Mumbai Municipal
Corporation that they are reserving those plots for public purpose. Therefore, there is
no question of granting any ad-interim relief at this stage. He further submits that if
this court comes to the conclusion that Petitioners are entitled adinterim relief, in
that case, issue about payment of interest may be kept open.
6. We have heard both the sides at length. We have also gone through the order dated
07.05.2021 in Writ Petition (St.) No.10294 of 2021. Similar issue is pending before
this court for hearing and fnal disposal on its own merits. In view of these facts,
following order is passed:

(b) Rejoinder, if any, to be fled on or before 05/07/2021, with copy to other side.
(c) Ad-interim relief in terms of prayer clauses (i) and (j) is granted, which read thus

without levying any interest or charges or penalty or late payment charges of any
nature, whatsoever on the Petitioner;
(j) That pending the hearing and fnal disposal of this Writ Petition, this Hon'ble

Letter."
(d) The matter to appear on the board on 13/07/2021 with connected Writ Petition
Stamp No. 10294 of 2021."
(emphasis supplied) The above interim reliefs as granted in the present proceedings
have continued to operate till date.
14. It needs to be noted that in the meanwhile, PIL petitions Nishant Karsan Bhagat vs. CIDCO and
Sunil J. Garg vs. State of Maharashtra (supra) were heard by a co-ordinate Bench of this Court, of
which one of us (G.S. Kulkarni, J.) was a member, and were decided by a judgment and order dated
30 August, 2022. In such decision, the Division Bench inter alia held that it was not permissible for
NMMC to make reservation of the plots of land vested with CIDCO in its capacity as the New Town
Development Authority, being the plots, which were subject matter of allotment to the petitioners. It
was held that CIDCO rightfully auctioned these plots of land of which the petitioners were
beneficiaries, to be developed at the hands of the petitioners/allottees, who were also the
respondents in the said petition. The following questions 3 May, 2023 WP2473_2021.DOC were
framed by the Division Bench as seen in paragraph 55 of the judgment, which were answered in the
negative:
"(i) Whether the General Body resolution of the NMMC proposing to reserve CIDCO
plots of land for public amenities, in the absence of publication of a Draft
Development Plan as per the provisions of Section 26 of the MRTP Act would create
an embargo of a reservation?

(ii) Whether passing of a resolution by the General Body of the NMMC proposing to
reserve the plots/lands, can in any manner divest the rights of CIDCO to make
allotment of the plots of land?
(iii) Whether the directions issued by the State Government under section 154 of the
Act dated 14 June, 2021 and subsequent directions dated 6 September, 2021 are in
any manner illegal contrary to the provisions of the MRTP Act?
15. The decision of the Division Bench in Nishant Karsen Bhagat (supra) was assailed before the
Supreme Court by one of the petitioners in the said PIL petitions in the proceedings of Special Leave
to Appeal (Civil) No. 22639 of 2022 (Chandra Mohan Bhatnagar & Ors. vs. State of Maharashtra &
Ors. ), which came to be dismissed by the Supreme Court by an order dated 10 February, 2023.
16. Thus, the Division Bench in Nishant Karsen Bhagat's case having held that there was no embargo
of any reservation in respect of plots of lands in question being allotted by CIDCO to the petitioners,
and that the said plots could not be subjected to reservation in any proposed development plan
necessarily a consequence was brought about that the allotment procedure 3 May, 2023
WP2473_2021.DOC could be taken forward, as the dark clouds of uncertainty faded into
insignificance.
17. It is on the above backdrop the proceedings are before us today. On behalf of the petitioners, the
common contention is to the effect that dismissal of SLP before the Supreme Court, affirming the
decision of this Court in Nishant Bhagat's case (supra) has paved the way for finalising the
allotments of these plots in favour of the petitioners by the CIDCO, for which the CIDCO needs to
accept the two installments of lease premium, the payment of which had remained suspended by
virtue of the interim orders passed by this Court in the present petitions and as noted above.
18. Mr. Viraj Tulzapurkar, Dr. Milind Sathe, Mr. G.S. Godbole, Mr. Rajeev Chavan and Mr. Madon,
learned senior counsel for the petitioners have made the following submissions:
(i) On CIDCO's tender, the petitioners submitted their bids for the plots of land which were
unencumbered and having potential of development for the purpose of for which the bids were
invited. There was not a slightest indication in the public advertisement and the information
brochure, inviting bids that the plots for which the petitioners would be submitting their offers, in
any manner were subject to any reservation for public amenities at the hands of NMMC. In such
situtation, if the petitioners were to proceed to make 3 May, 2023 WP2473_2021.DOC payment of
installments of lease premium in the prevailing situtation, it would have been nothing more than the
petitioners being put in a position of serious prejudice, jeopardy and litigation.
(ii) It was never the intention of the petitioners nor the intention of the CIDCO that the petitioners
who were being allotted plots, should in any manner be entangled in litigation, in respect of the
allotted plots and/or receive plots having no development potential, being created by virtue of the
actions of the NMMC, asserting that these plots shall be subjected to reservation for public purpose.
It can never be an intention of commercial persons like the petitioners, that by participating in such
Godrej Properties Ltd vs The State Of Maharashtra Thr. ... on 3 May, 2023
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/24293798/
16
public tenders issued by CIDCO, would not be having the benfit of what was offered by the CIDCO
and/or that any uncertainty would prevail after the full amount of lease premium was paid by the
petitioners.
(iii) In regard to the uncertainty created by the reservation as proposed by the NMMC over the
allotment of these plots, it is submitted that in paragraph 6 of the affidavit-in-reply of Mr. Hemant
Thakur, filed on behalf of NMMC, it was categorically stated that the General Body in its meeting
held on 13 December, 2019 has accorded sanction to the Draft Development Plan with major
changes and further resolved to publish it for inviting suggestions/objections from the general
public as envisaged under section 26(1) of the MRTP Act. It is 3 May, 2023 WP2473_2021.DOC
submitted that the General Body Resolution No. 1516 dated 13 December, 2019 was received by the
Town Planning Officer on 28 February, 2020 which had inter alia suggested reservation of various
plots which were yet to be allotted by CIDCO. In the affidavit it was categorically stated that in
respect of plots involved in the petition, the General Body had suggested reservation and that after
incorporating major changes suggested by the General Body Resolution, further process of
publication of the draft development plan for inviting suggestions and objections was to be initiated.
(iv) It is submitted that the reply affidavit of NMMC had also made it clear that a communication
was addressed by NMMC to the CIDCO on 22 December, 2017 inter alia informing the CIDCO that
without permission from the NMMC, no sub-division, amalgamation or allotments of plots to
individuals shall be granted by CIDCO. It is submitted that CIDCO also pointed out in its reply
affidavit that CIDCO had addressed letters dated 1February, 2021 and 5 March, 2021 to the State
Government as also NMMC to delete the proposed reservations in the draft Development Plan
clamped on CIDCO's 300 plots. In such context, NMMC had by its letter dated 12 April, 2021 had
submitted its detailed report to the Government to protect the statutory rights of NMMC as
Planning and Local Authority and also had sought protection from the State Government to allow
NMMC to publish the draft Development Plan. It is submitted that after allotment letters were 3
May, 2023 WP2473_2021.DOC addressed in April, 2021 to the Assistant Director of Town Planning
of the NMMC, informing that the petitioners had participated in the E-tender cum E-auction, as
undertaken by CIDCO and that the petitioners were successful bidders and beneficiaries of the
allotment letters issued by CIDCO, allotting plots for which the bids were submitted and thereafter
the petitioner was to make payment of first installment of lease premium by 13 May, 2021 and
second installment by 13 June, 2021. In such context, NMMC was requested by the petitioners that
the petitioners were given to understand that NMMC in its Planning Committee had reserved some
plots as public utility plots and hence it be informed to confirm whether the plot as allotted to the
petitioners were reserved for public utility purposes by the NMMC or otherwise, before the
installments are paid. However, no reply was received from NMMC and in these circumstances, the
petition came to be filed and this Court had granted protection to the petitioners on 7 May, 2021and
11 May, 2021. Also such letters are addressed to CIDCO, however, no reply was received. It is thus
submitted that all these are the circumstances which would show that there were encumberances on
the plots of land, namely, of the reservation for public utility and it is for such reason, a protection
came to be granted by interim orders passed by this Court. It is contended that the Vacation Bench
of this Court in such circumstances on 11 May, 2021 granted interim relief in terms of prayer clause
(i) and (j), which was a direction to CIDCO to extend and/or 3 May, 2023 WP2473_2021.DOC
Godrej Properties Ltd vs The State Of Maharashtra Thr. ... on 3 May, 2023
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/24293798/
17
supend the Schedule of Payment at Clause C of the Allotmnet letter, without levying any interest or
charges or penalty or late payment charges of any nature, whatsoever on the petitioner and also to
restrain CIDCO from cancelling/terminating the allotment of plots to the petitioner and terminating
the allotment letter and from taking any coercive or penal steps under the tender or under the
allotment letter.
(v) The petitioners, hence, have rightly invoked the jurisdiction of this Court, not only in assailing
such action of the NMMC, in regard to which the petitioners have already succeeded in their prayers
as made in the petition to such extent, when the PIL petitions came to be decided in their favour by
the judgment of the Division Bench in "Nishant Karsan Bhagat" case (supra) and further the
Supreme Court dismissing the SLP filed against the said decision of the Division Bench.
(vi) It is submitted that the petitioners were throughout protected by substantive orders, which
certainly have legal consequences inasmuch as the CIDCO could not have demanded payment of
lease premium either the first or the second installment, by virtue of the said interim orders. Thus,
by the interim orders passed by this Court on 7 May 2021 and 11 May 2021 the petitioners have
remained protected. The legal consequence brought about by the orders passed by this Court cannot
be overlooked by CIDCO. The CIDCO 3 May, 2023 WP2473_2021.DOC is now under an obligation
to pave the way to enable the petitioners to make payment of the balance lease premium, without
demanding any interest or delayed payment charges, as now the uncertainty over the reservation
has come to an end as a result of the SLP being dismissed against the decision of the Division Bench
of this Court in Nishant Karsan Bhagat's case (supra).
(vii) It is submitted that the consequences as brought about by the interim orders dated 7 May, 2021
and 11May, 2021 were accepted by the CIDCO and now when the uncertainty of allotment of plots
has been removed in view of the orders passed by the Supreme Court dismissing the SLP, the
CIDCO cannot turn around and take a position that CIDCO would now not accept two installments
of lease premium payable by the petitioners under the allotment of plots in question. It is submitted
that even the Earnest Money Deposit at all material times stood deposited with the CIDCO and it
was never attempted to be refunded to the petitioners much less by praying for modification of the
interim orders dated 7 May, 2021 and 11 May, 2021.
(viii) It is submitted that the petitioners were in a total state of uncertainty inasmuch as Section 46
of the MRTP Act was staring at the petitioners once the NMMC had decided to assert that the plots
of land allotted to the petitioners are under reservation. This for the reason that even if the
petitioners were to proceed to pay the balance lease premium and accept 3 May, 2023
WP2473_2021.DOC allotment, plots which were purportedly reserved by the NMMC, the
petitioners could not have proceeded to develop the plots in the light of the proposed reservation.
(ix) It is next submitted that the position of the plots alloted to the petitioners being proposed to be
reserved by the NMMC was so firm that the State Government was required to intervene by issuance
of a notification under section 154 of MRTP Act dated 14 June, 2021 and 6 September, 2021, which
itself was subject matter of challenge in the PIL petitions filed by Nishant Karsen Bhagat and by
Sunil J. Garg. It is thus submitted that till the Division Bench of this Court decided that the NMMC
Godrej Properties Ltd vs The State Of Maharashtra Thr. ... on 3 May, 2023
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/24293798/
18
could never exercise its powers as Planning Authority to reserve the plots in question, being allotted
to the petitioners, uncertainty on the allotment of the plots in favour of the petitioners very much
subsisted, till the same was ultimately confirmed by the Supreme Court in the SLP being dismissed
on 10 February, 2023.
(x) It is submitted that most significantly the brochure inviting bids in respect of plots inviting
tenders, in regard to the time limit for payment of installment of lease premium recognize the
powers of the Managing Director to extend the period determined in the payment of installments of
lease premium, being Clause No. 19 and 20. It is submitted that such clauses as contained in the
brochure were completely in consonance with the statutory 3 May, 2023 WP2473_2021.DOC
regulations, being the Navi Mumbai Disposal of Land (Amendment Regulations, 2008), as framed
by the CIDCO in exercise of powers under sub- clause (i)(a) of Section 159(1) of MRTP Act. It is
submitted that however in the allotment letter as issued to the petitioners, a representation as
contained in Clauses 19 and 20 of the brochure was absent, as the allotment letter contained a clause
contrary to the same, namely, Clause (g) when it provided that all the installments of lease premium
shall be required to be paid within the time limit as prescribed in the allotment letter and no
extension of time whatsoever will be given to the allottee by the Corporation under any
circumstances.
(xi) It is submitted that to overcome the situation of any such uncertainty, Regulation 6 of the New
Town Disposal of Land Regulations (supra), clearly provides for a power with the Managing
Director to grant relaxation of the time limit to make payment of the lease premium, as may be
prescribed in the allotment letter for making payment of lease premium and for relaxation for
making of payment on delayed payment charges. This is a fit case where the Managing Director
ought to have exercised his powers and ought to have accepted two installments of lease premium
from the petitioners.
(xii) Supporting such contentions, learned senior counsel for the petitioner has placed reliance on
the decision of Hira Tikkoo vs. Union Territory, 3 May, 2023 WP2473_2021.DOC Chandigarh &
Ors.,1 and the decision of Division bench of this Court in Nishant Karsen Bhagat vs. CIDCO & Ors.
(supra).
19. On the other hand, Mr. Hegde, learned senior counsel for CIDCO has made the following
submissions:
(i) At the outset, it is not disputed that the protection granted to the petitioners by virtue of interim
orders dated 7 May, 2021 and thereafter on 11 May, 2021 has contined to operate. Mr.Hegde would,
however, submit that now as the petitions are at the stage of hearing, the interim orders ought to
have any consequence on the principal prayers, as made in the petition.
(ii) It is submitted that it is not in dispute that in February, 2021, brochure/advertisements were
published inviting e-Tenders cum E-Auctions. The bidders had submitted online bids by making
payment of Earnest Money Deposit and that the bids were finalized by end of February, 2021 and
allotment letters were issued. He would submit that allotment letters issued to the petitioners have a
Godrej Properties Ltd vs The State Of Maharashtra Thr. ... on 3 May, 2023
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/24293798/
19
specific condition, namely, that the lease premium is required to be paid by allotees/petitioners in
two installments divided into a period of 10 weeks and no extension of time shall be granted in
making payment of the installments.
1 (2004) 6 SCC 765 3 May, 2023 WP2473_2021.DOC
(iii) It is submitted that PIL petitions filed by Nishant Karsen Bhagat (supra) and Sunil J. Garg
(supra) were frivolous and there was no impediment for the petitioners to make payment of lease
premium without prejudice to their rights and contentions. The petitioners were in fact required to
show their bonafides by depositing amounts of lease premium with CIDCO. However, the
petitioners took a contrary position and approached this Court and prayed for interim orders.
(iv) It is his submission that by virtue of interim orders as obtained by the petitioners, the
petitioners did not make payment of the amounts and they had retained the said amounts and in
fact used the amounts, which were to be paid by the petitioners to CIDCO. Mr. Hegde has submitted
that in this situation, the petitioners cannot be permitted to take advantage that now they would not
pay the interest and/or delayed payment charges, having clearly been put to notice that the
petitioners in fact were beneficiaries of such amounts and having utilized by not paying it to CIDCO.
(v) It is submitted that the NMMC by its letter dated 6 April, 2021 issued to the petitioner
(petitioner in Writ Petiton No. 2473/2022) in response to a right to information application of the
said petitioner dated 1 March, 2021, had not furnished correct information in regard to the
reservation of the said plots. Mr. Hegde's submission is that in fact in law, the plots were never
under 3 May, 2023 WP2473_2021.DOC reservation and what the CIDCO had tendered were
encumbered plots and for such reason, it was incumbent for the petitioner to make payment of lease
premium as per the terms and conditions of allotment letter. It is submitted that the petitions are
not maintainable, as the petitioners are demanding something which is contrary to the terms and
conditions of the allotment letter.
(vi) It is submitted that these petitions were filed only on an apprehension. In fact the directives of
the State Government issued under section 154 of the MRTP Act were very clear that CIDCO had the
authority to make allotment of the plots in question and accordingly, the allotments were made to
the petitioners and, therefore, the petitioners were required to make payment of the installments of
lease premium. However, the petitioners were not willing to make such payment, thus, necessarily
the petitioners would be required to pay delayed payment charges/interest, as per the allotment
letters as also as permissible under the New Bombay Disposal of Land Regulations. The petitioners
in fact on their own accord ought to have paid the lease premium amounts.
(vii) It is submitted that, in fact after the Division Bench of this Court dismissed the PIL petitions
filed by Nishant Karsen Bhagat (supra) and by Mr. Sunil Garg (supra), it was incumbent on the
petitioners to make the payment and they ought not to have waited till the Supreme Court dismissed
the Special 3 May, 2023 WP2473_2021.DOC Leave Petition and thus, there is no question of any
relief being granted to the petitioners. It is accordingly, submitted that the interim orders need to be
vacated and the petitions be dismissed. In support of such contentions, Mr. Hegde has placed
Godrej Properties Ltd vs The State Of Maharashtra Thr. ... on 3 May, 2023
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/24293798/
20
reliance on the decision of the Supreme Court in Amarjeet Singh & Ors. vs. Devi Ratan & Ors. 2 to
submit that it is a settled principle of law that no litigant can derive any benefit from mere pendency
of case in a court of law, as the interim order passed by the Court always merges in the final order to
be passed in the case.
20. In rejoinder, on behalf of the petitioners, learned senior counsel for the parties would submit
that the present petitions were always listed along with the PIL petitions as the petitioners were also
respondents in the PIL petitions, and in fact the petitioners have succeeded insofar as part of their
prayers as made in the present petitions in regard to the issue of reservation by NMMC on the
tendered plots, hence CIDCO cannot take a position that petitions were filed on apprehension. It is
submitted that for such reason, prayer clause (a) is not required to be adjudicated. It is next
submitted that it is too much for the CIDCO to expect that the allottees like the petitioners get
sandwiched between two public bodies, namely, CIDCO and NMMC. The petitioners having partly
succeeded in their petitions on the prayers on the NMMC purporting to make 2 2009 SCC Online SC
1817 3 May, 2023 WP2473_2021.DOC reservation on these plots, hence, the decision of the
Supreme Court in Amarjeet Singh (supra) is totally not applicable.
Analysis and Conclusion
21. We have heard learned senior counsel for the petitioners. We have perused the record.
22. Indisputedly, the petitioners are the beneficiaries of public tenders issued by CIDCO inviting
bids for allotment of plots, which stood vested in the CIDCO. The vesting of such plots in the CIDCO
was certainly by virtue of the authority and power as conferred on the CIDCO by the State
Government appointing CIDCO as the 'New Town Development Authority.' It is now clear that
although NMMC was constituted, CIDCO never lost its authority and power to dispose of the plots
in question, in accordance with the statutory regulations, namely, the New Bombay Disposal of
Lands Regulations, as noted above. It is by virtue of such statutory authority, CIDCO had invited the
bids in question in February, 2021. The petitioners are all successful bidders. They have been issued
allotment letters allotting the respective plots in their favour.
3 May, 2023 WP2473_2021.DOC
23. At this juncture, it needs to be observed that when public tenders came to be issued by the
CIDCO, the plots in question as allotted to the petitioners in no manner whatsoever were indicated
to be encumbered and/or were under any proposed reservation of the NMMC. Thus, the legitimate
expectation of the petitioners was certainly, that the petitioners when were receiving allotment of
such plots, after paying extraordinary large sums of money/valuable consideration, the plots would
be available to the petitioners to be developed by them, for the purpose as set out in the brochure
and in the allotment letters issued to the petitioners. However, there is no doubt whatsoever, as also
the record is replete with materials, that such impression of the petitioners as borne out by the
allotment letters, that they are receiving unencumbered plots was not correct and/or in fact there
was a dent to this impression that the plots allotted to the petitioners were in fact being subjected to
reservation by the NMMC. This position was further clear and compounded by the NMMC taking a
Godrej Properties Ltd vs The State Of Maharashtra Thr. ... on 3 May, 2023
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/24293798/
21
stand asserting reservation in respect of plots in question and on the other hand, CIDCO insisting
that the plots cannot be subject matter of reservation by the NMMC, and in such situation, the State
Government was required to intervene, by issuing directives under section 154 of the MRTP Act,
clarifying the position that NMMC cannot reserve the plots which stood vested with CIDCO.
Further, such directives including the insistence of the NMMC to implement the decision of the
General Body of the NMMC to 3 May, 2023 WP2473_2021.DOC reserve these plots, as also the
directives of the State Government were subject matter of challenge before this Court in the
proceedings of the PILs files by Nishant Karsen Bhagat and by Sunil J. Garg (supra), was a situation
writ large for the petitioners to pursue the present proceedings.
24. Such PIL petitions were adjudicated by the Division Bench of this Court in the case of Nishant
Karsan Bhagat & Ors.vs. City and Industrial Development Corporation of Maharashtra Ltd. & Ors.
(supra). By its judgment and order dated 30 August, 2022, the Division Bench held that NMMC had
no authority to make any reservation or to reserve the subject plots which were allotted to the
petitioners. The directives of the State Government issued under section 154 were upheld by the
Division Bench and PILs were dismissed. The SLP against the said PILs was also dismissed by the
order dated 10 February, 2023 passed by the Supreme Court. It is thus quite clear that uncertainty
on the issue of plots allotted to the petitioners being reserved by the NMMC, stood wiped out by the
Supreme Court dismissing the SLP in question as noted above.
25. The CIDCO, therefore, would not be correct in its contention that the allotment of plots in favour
of the petitioners was without any dispute or controversy in regard to the reservation proposed to be
imposed by the NMMC.
3 May, 2023 WP2473_2021.DOC
26. It also cannot be overlooked that the petitioners were allotted such plots purely for commercial
purposes, that is, to be utilized for residential/commercial development and unless such allotment
was to be as clear as the sunlight without any uncertainty on its development potential, the
petitioners could not have proceeded to complete the transaction formalities of making further
payments. Thus, considering as to what was promised by the CIDCO in the notice inviting bids, the
petitioners could not be said to be incorrect in their contentions that they had reason to believe that
for making payment of instalments, every uncertainty not only from the CIDCO but also from
NMMC and State Government was required to be removed.
27. It also needs to be observed that public body like the CIDCO cannot place the allottees of the
plots like the petitioners in a situation of uncertainty or a fait accompli, when the representation of
the CIDCO to the bidders was to the effect that these were clear plots available for development
which later on was realised to be not the correct position. This more particularly when the
petitioners were to make payment accepting a clear representation from the CIDCO as made to
them, namely, of the plots not being under reservation. After payment of the total lease premium,
which are large amounts, the petitioners could not been confronted with a situation that the plots as
allotted to them by the CIDCO could not be developed as they are proposed to be reserved by
NMMC for public purposes, and further after making such large 3 May, 2023 WP2473_2021.DOC
Godrej Properties Ltd vs The State Of Maharashtra Thr. ... on 3 May, 2023
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/24293798/
22
payments, the petitioners are made to litigate either for refund of the amounts or for removal of
such uncertainty of any proposed reservation to be removed. It is in these circumstances, the
petitioners approached this Court in the present proceedings.
28. It also needs an emphasis that the petitioners were parties in both the PILs as filed by the
petitioner-Nishant Karsen Bhagat (PIL No. 22 of 2021) and by the second PIL as filed by Sunil J.
Garg (PIL No. 37 of 2022). The petitioners defended these petitions along with CIDCO and State
Government. The observations as made by the Division Bench in Nishant Bhagat's case relevant in
the present context are required to be noted, which reads thus:
"76. On a cumulative reading of the different notifications as issued by the State
Government under Section 154 of the MRTP Act and as discussed above, it is
manifest that although the NMMC was constituted as a Municipal Corporation in
exercise of the powers under section 3 of the NMMC Act, 1949, there was never an
intention on the part of the State Government to divest CIDCO of any of its authority
as a New Town Development Authority or a Development Authority within the
meaning of Section 113(3A) read with Section 2(8) of the MRTP Act. Thus, CIDCO
was within its power to develop the undeveloped lands even in the developed nodes,
which stood vested in it and allowed the said lands by exercising its statutory powers
as conferred under section 118 of the MRTP Act along with other ancillary powers
being exercised under the New Bombay Disposal of Land Regulations, 1975 and Navi
Mumbai Disposal of Lands (Amendment) Regulations, 2008 for disposal of lands.
77. In these circumstances, it was not permissible for the NMMC to take any position
to prevent CIDCO from exercising its statutory powers and duties as the New Town
Development Authority to dispose of such lands by purporting to impose an embargo
by foisting 3 May, 2023 WP2473_2021.DOC reservations on the plots of land being
developed by CIDCO and now subjected to an allotment by public auction by virtue of
the tender process as undertaken in the month of January, 2021 which already stands
completed and the allottees, namely, the private respondents, are in the process of
finalizing such allotments.
78. To our mind, it is quite clear that the roles of both CIDCO and the NMMC qua the
Navi Mumbai area have been recognized by the State Government and completely
within the parameters of the MRTP Act. Time and again by issuance of different
notifications, the State Government has clarified the position that no conflict ought to
be brought about in the functioning of both these bodies exercising their powers and
functions as conferred on them under the MRTP Act. Significantly, the intention of
the State Government not only from its directives but also from the stand taken by
the State Government in the reply affidavit appears to be quite clear, namely, to
recognize the role of both these authorities which is quite compartmentalized. The
State Government has categorically recognized that since the time CIDCO was
constituted as the New Town Development Authority and till the constitution of the
NMMC and for such period even after its constitution, CIDCO has discharged its
Godrej Properties Ltd vs The State Of Maharashtra Thr. ... on 3 May, 2023
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/24293798/
23
functions as the Planning Authority by reserving lands for different public amenities
and it is not the case as put up by the petitioners that the Navi Mumbai area was
developed by CIDCO without being alive to the different public needs and purposes
and in fact has allocated lands for large number of public purpose. Thus, the charge
of the petitioners that the allotment in question in favour of the private respondents
by CIDCO is only a revenue earning exercise, is totally untenable. Such revenue being
earned by disposal of lands by CIDCO is also being utilized for the purpose of
development of Navi Mumbai, which itself is a public purpose.
(emphasis supplied)
29. Considering the decision of the Division Bench and as confirmed by the Supreme Court, there is
no manner of doubt that the petitioners are correct in their contention that the very plots alloted to
the petitioners were not only subject matter of proposed reservation by NMMC and if the PIL
petitions were to succeed, the allotment itself could never have materialized. In these circumstances,
if the entire payment of lease premium was to be made by the petitioners, the same would have
ended in a non-sequiter, as the allotment 3 May, 2023 WP2473_2021.DOC would have remained
only a paper allotment, that too after the petitioners parting with large amounts of lease premium.
Such was never the intention of CIDCO in inviting bids and calling upon the petitioners to
participate. As noted above, it was never the intention of the petitioners to bid for plots which were
under such clouds of uncertainty and/or impredicability. Moreover, it can never be expected from a
pubic body that it can vaguely deal with any public largesse and in a manner not intended by the
original terms and conditions of allotment and/or in deviation from the original terms and
conditions, on the basis of which the allottees participated in the tenders. Significantly, in the
present case, possibility of the petitioners being led to a total inconsequential and/or a non-fruitful
allotment of plots, if the PIL petitions were to succeed, would have culminated into a total
inconsequential allotment of plots by CIDCO to petitioners. Such action of CIDCO would have been
clearly hit by petitioners rights guaranteed by Article 14 of the Constitution, as the petitioners were
treated arbitrarily and/or not fairly in the matter of allotment of the plots read with Section 19(1)(g),
as the allotments were for commercial purposes. This apart, this would have also led CIDCO to a
litigation if it was not to refund the amounts.
30. It can never be an intention of a public body that private parties are dragged into unwarranted
litigation when such public body deals with public largesse. Thus, certainly a public body like the
CIDCO was required to bear in 3 May, 2023 WP2473_2021.DOC mind adherence to the
requirement of fairness, non-discrimination and fulfillment of the basic and legitimate expectations
of the allottees of plots in question, namely, that the plots could be utilized for the purpose for which
it is allotted and only on such firm foundation accept consideration from the allottees.
31. In our opinion, it would have been a fair approach for the CIDCO having known the intention of
NMMC to reserve the plots by adhering to the principles of fairness and non-discrimination, instead
of insisting the petitioners to make payment of lease premium, CIDCO should have let the doubts,
dilemna and the questions marks on such allotments withered down. The CIDCO thus ought to have
waited for adjudication of PIL petitions and till the issues reached their finality, the allotment of

plots could not have been disturbed by the CIDCO. Such an expectation from the public body like
CIDCO could have been a fair and legitimate approach in the facts and circumstances of the present
case, when NMMC was initially at logger heads with CIDCO to reserve the plots of land as allotted to
the petitioners, till the State Government intervened by issuing directives under section 154 of
MRTP Act and finally when such clouds of uncertainty were removed by the decision of the Division
Bench in PIL petitions and confirmed by the Supreme Court.

32. We are hence are not inclined to accept any of the contentions of Mr. Hegde when in the present
facts, he submits that despite the hanging sword of uncertainty on the allotment of plots as made in
favour of the petitioners, the petitioners ought to have paid two instalments of lease premium and
having not paid the amounts, they are liable to pay delayed payment charges and/or interest.
33. Mr. Hegde is also not correct in asserting the above proposition for the reason that such an
argument completely overlooks and militates against the directives of this Court in the interim
orders dated 7 May, 2021 and 11 May, 2021 by virtue of which this Court had suspended and/or
directed the CIDCO to extend the schedule of payment stipulated in clause G of the Allotment
Letters, without levying on the petitioner, any interest or charges or penalty of any nature, monetary
or otherwise, and/or forfeiture and/or termination of the Allotment Letter. The interim orders
passed by this Court certainly brought about binding legal consequences, namely, that such interim
order passed by this Court suspended the schedule of payment stipulated in the allotment letter,
also directing the CIDCO not to claim any interest or impose any penalty. Such interim orders
passed by this Court were accepted by CIDCO, as the interim orders were never assailed by the
CIDCO, and such interim order continued to operate till date.
3 May, 2023 WP2473_2021.DOC
34. Also, Mr. Hegde's contention that the petitioners be directed to make payment of interest and/or
delayed payment charges is directly in the teeth of the interim orders passed by this Court. By virtue
of such orders, CIDCO can neither demand any interest or delayed payment charges nor the CIDCO
can terminate the allotments as made in favour of the petitioners. If this is the plain consequence of
the interim orders dated 7 May, 2021and 11 May, 2021 as passed by this Court, we wonder as to how
Mr. Hegde can argue a position contrary to such orders, when the interim orders were wholly
accepted by the CIDCO. Even for such reason, the contentions as urged on behalf of CIDCO that the
petitioners ought to pay to CIDCO any delayed payment charges and/ or interest cannot be
accepted.
35. Now coming to the decisions as relied on behalf of the parties, Mr. Tulzapurkar has relied on the
decision of the Supreme Court in Hira Tikkoo vs. Union Territory, Chandigarh & Ors. (supra). We
find that the reliance on such decision to be well-founded. The Supreme Court in such decision has
emphasized on the rule of reasonableness and fairness to be adhered by the statutory authority, in
the context of parties, who for no fault on their part were deprived of original plots alloted to them,
and in fact it is recognized that they would be entitled to refund of the amount. The relevant

observations in that regard can be noted:
3 May, 2023 WP2473_2021.DOC "25. Surely, the doctrine of estoppel cannot be applied against
public authorities when their mistaken advice or representation is found to be in breach of a statute
and therefore, against general public interest. The question, however, is whether the parties or
individuals, who had suffered because of the mistake and negligence on the part of the statutory
public authorities, would have any remedy of redressal for the loss they have suffered. The "rules of
fairness" by which every public authority is bound, require them to compensate loss occasioned to
private parties or citizens who were misled in acting on such mistaken or negligent advice of the
public authority. There are no allegations and material in these cases to come to a conclusion that
the action of the authorities was mala fide. It may be held to be careless or negligent. In some of the
English cases, the view taken is that the public authorities cannot be absolved of their liability to
provide adequate monetary compensation to the parties who are adversely affected by their
erroneous decisions and actions. But in these cases, any directions to the public authorities to pay
monetary compensation or damages would also indirectly harm general public interest. The public
authorities are entrusted with public fund raised from public money. The funds are in trust with
them for utilisation in public interest and strictly for the purposes of the statute under which they
are created with specific statutory duties imposed on them. In such a situation when a party or
citizen has relied, to his detriment, on an erroneous representation made by public authorities and
suffered loss and where the doctrine of "estoppel" will not be invoked to his aid, directing
administrative redressal would be a more appropriate remedy than payment of monetary
compensation for the loss caused by non-delivery of the possession of the plots and consequent
delay caused in setting up industries by the allottees.
(See Administrative Law by H.W.R. Wade and C.F. Forsyth, 8th Edn., at pp. 370-73. Also the book
Judicial Review of Administrative Action by de Smith, Woolf and Jowell, 5th Edn., at p. 565, para
13-028.)
30. After considering the rival submissions made on behalf of various parties, we are of the view that
the rule of reasonableness and fairness by which every statutory authority is bound, demands that
the consentees, who, for no fault on their part, were deprived of the original plots of larger sizes,
should not be further made to suffer by demanding from them higher price for the alternative plots
of smaller sizes. It would be highly iniquitous to demand from them higher price for smaller sizes of
plots and add to their losses caused by undue delay in setting up their industries. The
Administration is mainly to be blamed for the situation in which the allottees of plots find
themselves today. In preparing scheme and allotting plots, it could not have ignored the notification
reserving a part of land for the forst and the restriction to the extent of 900 metres around the air
force base. The allottees of the plots have paid full or part-price and that amount throughout
remained with the Administration. In such circumstances, the Administration must bear a portion
of loss, if any, occasioned to it and compensate to some extent the loss caused to the consentees who
never objected to allotment of alternative plots of smaller sizes. Direction 2 of the 3 May, 2023
WP2473_2021.DOC High Court, therefore, to the extent of charging price from the consentees as
prevailing on the date of draw of lots i.e., 27-3-1991, deserves to be set aside and substituted with the
directions that the consentees on being allotted a particular plot of smaller size shall be charged the

same price which was prevailing at the time of original allotment of the plot in their favour.
Necessary adjustment or refund of price, as the case may be, shall be given to them for the small size
of plot allotted."
(emphasis supplied)
36. Mr. Hegde would contend that interim order would merge in the final order and if the PIL
petitions were dismissed, the interim order as passed on the present petitions would be
inconsequential is a difficult proposition to be accepted in the present facts. In supporting such
proposition, Mr. Hegde relied on the decision of Amarjeet Singh & Ors. (supra). We do not agree
with Mr. Hegde when he is canvassing such proposition relying on the decision of Amarjeet Singh.
This for the reason that it is clearly seen that the petitioners have partly succeeded in their prayers,
which pertained to their case of assertion of rights against reservation of the plots in question,
having been turned down by a Division bench of this Court. Illustratively we have already noted
prayer clause (a) in Writ Petition No. 2473 of 2021. Thus, the petitioners are not in the same
position as that of the petitioners in the case of Amarjeet Singh & Ors. (supra). In such case,
Amarjeet had claimed benefits under the interim order passed by the High Court, when the petitions
itself stood dismissed before the High Court. Thus, the observations of the Supreme Court that no
litigant can derive any benefit from mere pendency of a case in a court of law, as the interim order
always merges in the final order to be passed in the case, 3 May, 2023 WP2473_2021.DOC and if the
writ petition is ultimately dismissed, the interim order stands nullified automatically and such party
cannot be allowed to take any benefit of its own wrongs, by getting an interim order and thereafter
blame the court, is inapplicable in the facts of the present case. The following observations of the
Supreme Court as relied by Mr. Hegde, in our opinion, are wholly inapplicable in the facts and
circumstances of the present case:
"16. In view of the fact that the respondents continued on a higher post under the
orders of this Court for years together and even after dismissal of the petition filed by
the State, and the exercise for making promotions was not undertaken by the State
Authorities, the appellants should not suffer for no fault of theirs. It has fairly been
conceded by learned counsel appearing for the respondents that had the exercise of
making promotions been undertaken immediately after the order of this Court dated
19.8.1998, the appellants could have been promoted much earlier and they could
have been senior to the respondents. Thus the question does arise as to whether
appellants should be asked to suffer for the interim order passed by this Court in a
case having no merits at all.
17. No litigant can derive any benefit from mere pendency of case in a Court of Law,
as the interim order always merges in the final order to be passed in the case and if
the writ petition is ultimately dismissed, the interim order stands nullified
automatically. A party cannot be allowed to take any benefit of his own wrongs by
getting interim order and thereafter blame the Court. The fact that the writ is found,
ultimately, devoid of any merit, shows that a frivolous writ petition had been filed.
The maxim "Actus Curiae neminem gravabit", which means that the act of the Court
Godrej Properties Ltd vs The State Of Maharashtra Thr. ... on 3 May, 2023
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/24293798/
27
shall prejudice no-one, becomes applicable in such a case. In such a fact situation the
Court is under an obligation to undo the wrong done to a party by the act of the
Court. Thus, any undeserved or unfair advantage gained by a party invoking the
jurisdiction of the Court must be neutralised, as institution of litigation cannot be
permitted to confer any advantage on a suitor from delayed action by the act of the
Court. (Vide Shiv Shankar & Ors. Vs. Board of Directors, Uttar Pradesh State Road
Transport Corporation & Anr., 1995 Suppl. (2) SCC 726; M/s. GTC Industries Ltd. Vs.
Union of India & Ors., AIR 1998 SC 1566; and Jaipur Municipal Corporation Vs. C.L.
Mishra, (2005) 8 SCC
423). 16.
18. In Ram Krishna Verma & Ors. Vs. State of U.P. & Ors., AIR 1992 SC 1888 this
Court examined the similar issue while placing reliance upon its earlier judgment in
Grindlays Bank Limited Vs. Income Tax Officer, 3 May, 2023 WP2473_2021.DOC
Calcutta & Ors., AIR 1980 SC 656 and held that no person can suffer from the act of
the Court and in case an interim order has been passed and petitioner takes
advantage thereof and ultimately the petition is found to be without any merit and is
dismissed, the interest of justice requires that any undeserved or unfair advantage
gained by a party invoking the jurisdiction of the Court must be neutralized.
(emphasis supplied)
37. Considering the above observations, it is not the case that the writ petition of the petitioners on
reservation of the plots by the NMMC had stood dismissed and in such situation, the petitioners
were asserting any advantage from the interim order having suffered a dismissal of the writ petition
as in Amarjeet's case. In fact, it is quite contrary that the petitioners have succeeded in their prayers
for reservation as noted by us in the foregoing paragraphs. Furthermore, Mr. Hegde is also not
contending that the petitioners are taking advantage on a dismissed writ petition.
38. We may also observe that these were appropriate and fit cases for the Managing Director of
CIDCO to exercise his authority under Regulation 8 of the New Bombay Disposal of Land
Regulations (supra) to issue appropriate directives not to charge any delayed payment charges or
interest from the petitioners when the allotment of plots itself was subject matter of protracted
litigation.
39. In such context, we may usefully refer to the decision of the Supreme Court in Unitech Limited &
Ors. vs. Telangana State Industrial Infrastructure 3 May, 2023 WP2473_2021.DOC Corporation
(TSIIC) & Ors.,3 in which the Supreme Court recognized the applicability of provisions of Article 14
in contractual matters and more particularly, in a case of allotment of land in favour of Unitech Ltd.
by the respondent-TSIIC. The allotment of land in such case was rendered inconsequential in view
of TSIIC losing in the pending litigation in which it was held that TSIIC had no authority to make
allotment of land in favour of Unitech, as it was not the owner of the land. It was held that in making
an allotment of a nature to Unitech, which ultimately was rendered inconsequential, it was
Godrej Properties Ltd vs The State Of Maharashtra Thr. ... on 3 May, 2023
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/24293798/
28
legitimate for Unitech to invoke jurisdiction under Article 226 of the Constitution, as certainly the
rights of Unitech as guaranteed under Article 14 of the Constitution stood violated. Moreover, the
Supreme Court exercising its jurisdiction under Article 142 of the Constitution granted refund of
entire amount of Rs.165 crores as paid by Unitech together with interest. Thus, certainly by virtue of
interim orders passed by this Court, the situation as in Unitech's case, namely, of the petitioners
paying full amount of lease premium on unpredicability of the allotments and/or existence of such
shaky grounds stood avoided. More significantly the interim orders have continued to operate till
date as accepted by the CIDCO, and hence the benefit of such orders has continued in favour of the
petitioners till the time we are pronouncing the present order.

40. In the light of the above discussion, we are of the clear opinion that the petitions are required to
be allowed. The Writ Petitions are accordingly allowed in terms of following orders:
(i) CIDCO is directed to accept the amounts of lease premium in two instalments as
per the terms and conditions of allotment letters issued to the petitioners, to be paid
by the petitioners within ten weeks from today without insisting on any delayed
payment charges or interest, on such installments.
(ii) In the event, the amounts of lease premium as directed in clause (i) above are not
deposited by the petitioners with the CIDCO, the CIDCO is permitted to take
appropriate action as may be permissible.
(iii) It is declared that the petitioners shall be entitled to develop the plots subject to
the terms and conditions of the allotment letter, and as may be permissible in law as
per the development permission, which may be issued in favour of the petitioners.
41. Rule is made absolute in the above terms. No costs.
3 May, 2023 WP2473_2021.DOC
42. In view of disposal of Writ Petitions, Interim Applications do not survive and the same are
accordingly disposed of.
