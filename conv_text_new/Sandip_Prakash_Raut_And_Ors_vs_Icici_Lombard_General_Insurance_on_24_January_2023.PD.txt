                      CIVIL APPLICATION NO.20164 OF 2022:
1. The civil application is filed for withdrawal of amount of compensation granted by the Motor
Accident Claims Tribunal. The Tribunal has directed the insurance company and owner to jointly
and severally pay an amount of Rs.8,15,200/- along with interest 17-fa721-2022.doc at the rate of
9% per annum.
2. Against that award, the claimant has filed first appeal, so also the insurance company.
3. According to the claimant, the Tribunal could not have recorded finding of contributory
negligence but it was a case of composite negligence. While it is the submission of the learned
advocate for the insurance company that the Tribunal has recorded contradictory finding inasmuch
as it has held the claimant to be a housewife but has also held the claimant to be running a mess.
4. Considering the aforesaid facts, the applicant has made out a case for withdrawal of compensation
to the extent of 50%.
5. The civil application is partly allowed in terms of prayer clause (a), subject to the applicant filing
an undertaking within eight weeks from today stating that in case the decision in the present first
appeals are against the claimants, they shall reimburse the insurance company with the amount
withdrawn along with interest at the prevalent bank rate.
6. Filing of paper-book in the claimant's appeal is dispensed with in view of the fact that the
insurance company has filed private paper-book.
7. List first appeal on 21st February 2023.
