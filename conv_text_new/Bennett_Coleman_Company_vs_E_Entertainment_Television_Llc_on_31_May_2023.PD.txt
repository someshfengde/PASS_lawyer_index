3. The defendant thereafter filed an appeal challenging the order dated 14th May, 2019 granting
interim injunction in favour of the plaintiff, wherein the Hon€ble Division Bench of this Court vide
order dated 30th May, 2019 in FAO(OS)(Comm) 135/2019 took the view that the defendant should
file an application under Order XXXIX Rule 4 seeking vacation of the ad-interim injunction.
Accordingly, I.A. No. 8833/2019 was filed by the defendant seeking vacation of the said injunction
order dated 14th May, 2019.
4. By I.A. 8832/2019, the defendant prays for rejection of the plaint filed by the plaintiff with
exemplary costs, or in alternative, the return of plaint for presentation before a court of competent
jurisdiction.
About the Plaintiff and its contentions
5. The plaintiff company is popularly known as the „Times Group€ which primarily runs print media
since 1838 and is the flagship company of Signature Not Verified Digitally Signed By:ANIL Signing
Date:31.05.2023 16:38:50 the Times Group Company. As per the plaint, the plaintiff has 33
publishing centers, 37 printing centers with over 7000 employees and a circulation of approximately
4.3 million copies daily, 29 niche magazines and 32 radio stations. Apart from being involved in
various businesses relating to media, it is also involved in television broadcasting and distribution
for its channels which is collectively and popularly known as the „Times Network€. It is claimed by
the plaintiff that the trademarks "TIME", "TIMES" and "NOW" are the property of the plaintiff
company only, and its subsidiaries and affiliates have been allowed to use the same. The plaintiff has
been using the series of mark "TIMES" and "NOW" in various combinations, in respect of television
channels for more than a decade. Times Network houses „Times Now€ channel, which is India€s
most viewed English News Channel operating successfully for over twelve years, „Times Now
World€ is the HD version of Times Now Channel, „ET Now€ channel is India€s most viewed
English Business News channel, „Mirror Now€ launched as „MAGICBRICKS NOW€, was India€s
first 24x7 Real Estate and Property Business Television Channel, which was revamped and renamed
as „Mirror Now€, channel „Movies Now€ is India€s first and most viewed English Movie channel,
„Romedy Now€ and „Romedy Now HD€ are India€s premium English Entertainment Channels
focused on Romance and Comedy. The suffix "NOW" is thus attached with all the channels of the
plaintiff except „Zoom€, „MN+€, „MNX€ and „MNX HD€ operated by the plaintiff or its
subsidiaries and therefore, any other word for the purposes of a name of a channel is distinctive of
the plaintiff.

6. It is the case of the plaintiff that on and from 13th October, 2008, it started using the logo "E
Now" for entertainment and film review shows where „E€ represents Entertainment and "NOW"
represents a connection with the brand of Times Group. The plaintiff decided to launch a new logo
of "E Now" and applied for registration of the trademark under class 38 and 41, and simultaneously,
application for trademark registration of old logo and word mark "E Now" was also applied by the
plaintiff on 09th February, 2018 with a user date from 13th October 2008. The registration of these
marks was opposed by the defendant claiming rights over the logo and use of "E!" by the defendant.

It was contended on behalf of the plaintiff that the present suit is limited to class 38 and 41 of the
trademark registrations which pertain to "television broadcasting services" and "television based
entertainment services" respectively.
7. It was contended on behalf of the plaintiff that the cause of action is based on the assertion of
proprietary right in respect of „E! Now€ and „E! News Now€ by the defendant for television
entertainment services falling under class 41. It was contended that the defendant has not filed any
trademark application for „E! Now€ or „E! News Now€ in India till date and hence, no right can be
claimed by the defendant. It was submitted that the present suit does not pertain to defendant€s
trademark "E!", rather the present suit is to prevent the defendant from using the mark "NOW" in
India. Further, it was submitted that the defendant aims to capitalize on the reputation and goodwill
of the plaintiff by choosing the plaintiff€s mark "NOW" for launching its portals with the mark „E!
Now€ or „E! New Now€ and claiming rights over the same and use of these said marks by the
Signature Not Verified Digitally Signed By:ANIL Signing Date:31.05.2023 16:38:50 defendant in
relation to the identical services and business is bound to cause confusion and deception. The
plaintiff has been using the „E NOW€ since 2008, the "NOW" mark is per se registered and it is an
essential feature of the plaintiff€s mark. It was contended on behalf of the plaintiff that it has a large
collection of marks with "NOW" as suffix and prefix and other variations and hence, it is the
proprietor of the "NOW" family marks in the television broadcast and entertainment services. The
plaintiff claims to have over 250 registrations with the mark "NOW", with 78 registrations in class
38 and about 76 registrations in class 41, and hence the plaintiff claims to have an exclusive right to
use the "NOW" family of marks in terms of Sections 28 and 29 of the Trademarks Act. Reliance was
placed on the decisions cited as 2009 (40) PTC 417 (Del.) (DB) Amar Singh Chawal Wala v. Shree
Vardhman Rice, AIR 1965 SC 980 Kaviraj Pandit Durga Dutt Sharma v. Navaratna Pharmaceutical
and AIR 1963 SC 449 Amritdhara Pharmacy v. Satya Deo Gupta. It is claimed that on account of
their prior adoption, extensive use and promotion of the "NOW" marks, the plaintiff€s said marks
have acquired distinctiveness and earned immense reputation as a brand and unique identity of its
channels, for which the plaintiff also relies upon various decisions of this Court where the mark
"NOW" was recognized; Bennett Coleman and Company Ltd. v. Real Video Impact Pvt. Ltd and
Anr., [CS(OS) No. 1701 of 2014, order dated 08.08.2014], Bennett Coleman and Company Ltd. v. M.
Akram Pasha, [CS(OS) No.828 of 2018, order dated 08.08.2018] and Bennett Coleman and
Company Ltd. v. Future Vision Broadcast Private Limited, [CS(COMM) No.846 of 2016, order dated
23.12.2016].

8. It was further contended that the marks of the defendant i.e. „E! Now€ and „E! News Now€ have
a structural similarity with the plaintiff€s marks E NOW used in relation to television programmes
which constitutes infringement as also passing off. It was further contended that although the
defendant has asserted its proprietary right and challenged the plaintiff€s marks before the
Registrar as well as by way of cease and desist notice, but the defendant is yet to use its marks in
India. Further, the plaintiff has no ways and means to anticipate defendant€s plan in Indian market,
however, the rights asserted and rights challenged constitute sufficient basis for the apprehension
that the activities of defendant might violate plaintiff€s right and hence, plaintiff seeks relief by way

of a quia timet action. Reliance was placed on the decision cited as AIR 2000 SC 1410 Kuldip Singh
v. Subhash Chander Jain & Ors. It is thus prayed that in view of the prima case having been
established, alongwith the balance of convenience and irreparable injury in its favour, the plaintiff is
entitled to the relief of injunction.
About the Defendant and its contentions
9. As per the defendant, it is an American pay television channel owned by the NBC Universal Cable
Entertainment Group Division of NBC Universal Media LLC, which is a global media and
entertainment conglomerate with its presence in various countries. It runs various programs, shows
and activities under mark "E!" and E! formative marks such as „E! Entertainment€, „E! Online€, „E!
News€, „E! HD€, etc. The defendant used the name „E! News Now€ for a digital/ online news
segment/ bulletin around the year 2007, and „E! Now€ online television Signature Not Verified
Digitally Signed By:ANIL Signing Date:31.05.2023 16:38:50 service was launched in or around
March 2013 in USA and other countries. The said service is featured and promoted online on its E!
Online website i.e. eonline.com. The defendant claims to be the registered proprietor of several E!
and E! formative marks under class 9, 38 and 41 of the Trademarks Act. It was contended on behalf
of the defendant that the plaintiff filed applications seeking registration of "E NOW" and its variants
in classes 38 and 41 which were duly opposed by the defendant on the grounds of the similarity with
its E! and other E! formative marks. The defendant also issued a cease and desist notice to the
plaintiff on 30 th May 2018.
10. It was the case of the defendant that the earliest registration of the mark "NOW" by the plaintiff
is of 31 st July, 2008 which is subsequent to the date of use of „E! News Now€ by the defendant, and
hence, the "NOW" label and marks have been wrongly registered. It was contended on behalf of the
defendant that the services for which the injunction has been granted clearly fall under class 38,
where the plaintiff has no registration over the mark "NOW". The order granting interim relief dated
14 th May, 2019 wrongly records that the trademark "NOW" is registered in various categories since
2006, however, the plaintiff has no registration on the standalone mark "NOW" and therefore, the
said interim order was based on misrepresented facts. It was further contended that in view of the
fact that the plaintiff does not have a standalone registration in class 38, the plaintiff€s family of
"NOW" marks cannot be compared to the trademarks of the defendant i.e. „E! Now€ or „E! News
Now€, rather only that particular mark of the plaintiff which allegedly infringes the mark of
defendant should Signature Not Verified Digitally Signed By:ANIL Signing Date:31.05.2023
16:38:50 be compared. It was contended that there is no evidence to prove the use of "TIMES NOW"
or any other "NOW" suffix marks by the plaintiff since 2006 and the filing of trademark registration
certificates is not sufficient to demonstrate use and/ or prior use which is critical for grant of interim
relief. It was submitted that the onus is on the plaintiff to show that it had attained goodwill in 2007
when the defendant started using E! News Now in the international market and not just in India. It
was further contended by the defendant that the mark "NOW" per se cannot be well known mark as
the same has never been used by the plaintiff for any goods or services, rather all are uses of
composite marks. Reliance was placed on MANU/DE/0832/2020 Peps Industries Pvt. Ltd. v.
Kurlon Ltd.

11. It was contended on behalf of the defendant that the essential feature of the defendant€s mark is
E!, which is distinctive arising out of bona fide adoption of E! News Now since 2007 and E! Now
since 2013 having transborder reputation, and as a prior user, the defendant€s rights are superior to
that of the plaintiff€s. Further, there is no use of the standalone mark "NOW" for which mere
registration is not sufficient. It was contended that the plaintiff had applied for registration of E
News, E TV and E Net in classes 9, 38 and 41, but those applications were withdrawn pursuant to
oppositions filed by the defendant. It was further contended that the plaintiff had suppressed,
concealed and misrepresented material facts. The plaintiff had expressly stated before the
trademark registry in its reply to objections to „Romedy Now€ that no exclusivity can be claimed
over the mark "NOW" as it is "common to the trade". It was submitted that these disclaimers also
demonstrate that even in the opinion of the Trademark registry, "NOW" is Signature Not Verified
Digitally Signed By:ANIL Signing Date:31.05.2023 16:38:50 common to trade, and as the plaintiff
did not take up the issue of disclaimer with registry, it can be assumed that the disclaimer was
acceptable to the plaintiff, and only after defendant pointed out the same in the present proceedings,
that the plaintiff wrote to the Registry expressing concern over the disclaimer. Reliance was placed
on the decision cited as MANU/DE/2363/2018 Mankind Pharma Ltd. v. Chandra Mani Tiwari and
(2016) 1 HCC (Del) 250 SK Sachdeva & Anr. v. Shree Educare Ltd. & Anr. It was further contended
that the mark NOW is a publici juris as a number of third parties are also using the same for
example, Kotak Now, PlayStation Now, Eros Now, VCNOW and so on, and when one part of a
composite mark is a publici juris, the consumers focus on the rest of the mark. Reliance was placed
on MANU/DE/0311/1997 SBL Ltd. v. Himalaya Drug Co., MANU/DE/0009/2010 Skyline
Education Institute Pvt. Ltd. v. SL Vaswani, MANU/SC/0052/1955 Registrar of Trademarks v.
Ashok Chandra Rakhit, MANU/DE/0869/2007 Astrazenca UK Ltd. v. Orchid Chemicals &
Pharmaceuticals Ltd. and MANU/DE/3179/2009 Schering Corporation & Ors. v. Alkem
Laboratories Ltd.
12. It was further contended that the „disclaimers€ were not disclosed to this court at the time when
interim injunction was granted or in its plaint or application. Further, there are three trademarks
where the word "NOW" appearing as a suffix has been disclaimed i.e. trademark registration nos.
2500350, 2500351 and 569469, and there are six other registrations with NOW as a suffix which
have been challenged by a third party, but neither of these facts have been disclosed by the plaintiff.
It was further contended that the plaintiff does not have any trademark registration on the use of the
Signature Not Verified Digitally Signed By:ANIL Signing Date:31.05.2023 16:38:50 mark "NOW" in
class 38, hence ad interim injunction could not possibly have been extended to internet/ web portals
and television programs which fall under the head telecommunications (class 38). Furthermore, it
was submitted there are at least 39 other registrations in class 38 and 34 other registrations in class
41 which use "NOW" as a suffix. There is nothing on record to show that the plaintiff has been using
the mark "NOW" as a standalone mark and therefore, the plaintiff cannot be given the benefit when
it has failed to disclose this fact of non-use of the standalone mark. Further, even otherwise, the
defendant is not using "NOW" as a standalone mark over which the plaintiff seeks protection, and
thus there is no basis to restrain the defendant from starting any channel/ programme in India.
Reliance was placed on the decision reported as MANU/DE/0295/2016 Living Media India Ltd. &
Anr. v. Alpha Dealcom Pvt. Ltd. (SB), MANU/DE/0461/2014 Living Media India Ltd. & Anr. v.
Alpha Dealcom Pvt. Ltd. (DB) and (2010) 2 SCC 142 Skyline Education Institute (Pvt.) Ltd. v. SL

Vaswani & Ors. The defendant also submitted that an equitable relief cannot be granted to a party
who has approached the court with unclean hands as held in the case reported as 155 (2008) DLT 56
Warner Bros. Entertainment Inc. & Anr. v. Harinder Kohli & Ors., (2017) 241 DLT 319 Paramount
Surgimed Ltd. v. Paramount Bed India Pvt. Ltd. & Ors., 2017 SCC OnLine Del 8122 Columbia
Sportswear Company v. Harish Footwear & Anr. and AIR 2004 SC 1469 R. Vishwanatha Pillai v.
State of Kerala.
13. It was further contended that the present suit cannot be seen as a quia timet action because the
defendant€s marks E! News Now and E! Now have been in existence since 2007 and 2013
respectively and the Indian Signature Not Verified Digitally Signed By:ANIL Signing
Date:31.05.2023 16:38:50 customers are well aware of the same and that the defendant has a
tremendous goodwill and reputation in India due to internet exposure. It was further contended
that the fact that defendant will execute agreements if it wants to launch a channel in Delhi is not a
basis of jurisdiction and the threat cannot be said to be real and imminent to sustain quia timet
action. The Indian customers have been exposed but no specific targeting of Indian customers and
no commercial transaction was done in Delhi and the onus is on the Plaintiff to establish that the
defendant had targeted the people in Delhi. It was also contended that there is no "real and
imminent" threat for quia timet action as no steps have been taken by the defendant to launch a
channel or programme in India for which, reliance was placed on the decision cited as 2017 (70)
PTC 316 (Del.) Radico Khaitan Ltd. v. Nakshatra Distilleries & Breweries Ltd & Ors. and Allied
Blenders & Distilleries v. RK Distilleries Pvt. Ltd. [FAO(OS) 251/2016 dated 28.02.2017].
14. It was further contended that the elements of "classical trinity" i.e. goodwill, misrepresentation
and damage must be proved for claiming injunction. Plaintiff€s mark "NOW" which is descriptive
and non- distinctive mark cannot be said to have attained goodwill internationally within one year
when the plaintiff€s channel TIMES NOW was allegedly launched in 2006 and the defendant
started using the mark E! News Now in 2007. The defendant€s use of E! News Now is prior to that
of the plaintiff€s use of E NOW, and therefore there is no scope of any misrepresentation. Further
no damage whatsoever has been caused to the plaintiff as the defendant is not using its marks E!
Now or E! News Now in India for any Signature Not Verified Digitally Signed By:ANIL Signing
Date:31.05.2023 16:38:50 programme/ channel for which reliance was placed
MANU/SC/0472/1995 Gujarat Bottling Co. Ltd. v. Coca Cola Co., MANU/SC/0553/1994 Morgan
Stanley Mutual Fund v. Kartick Das and (2017) 241 DLT 48 Radico Khaitan Ltd. v. Nakshatra
Distilleries & Breweries Ltd. & Ors.
15. The defendant had moved the above mentioned I.A.No.8832/2019 for rejection/ return of plaint,
as the suit is without jurisdiction and without any cause of action and therefore, the same being not
maintainable is liable to be returned/ rejected. It was contended on behalf of the defendant that this
court does not have the territorial jurisdiction to deal with the present suit as the registered office of
the plaintiff is at Mumbai which has not been disclosed by it, rather the plaintiff has claimed that its
registered office is at New Delhi with an aim to create jurisdiction of this Court. Even in its reply to
the said appeal FAO(OS)(Comm) 135/2019, the plaintiff claimed the mentioning of incorrect
address to be a typographical error, for which the plaintiff even sought to amend the pleadings. It
was submitted that the Delhi office of the plaintiff is not its registered office and the mentioning of
Bennett, Coleman & Company ... vs E! Entertainment Television Llc on 31 May, 2023
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/119534644/
6
the Delhi address cannot be typographical error. Even the Delhi address so given by the plaintiff is
incorrect as the same is not its own office address but that of its attorney. Further, no cause of action
can be said to have arisen in Delhi just because cease & desist and subsequent correspondence was
sent from Delhi. Although the cease & desist notice was addressed to the Delhi office, but there is no
law under Section 29 of the Trademarks Act as relied upon by the plaintiff to show that in an
infringement suit, issuance of a letter to their wrongly identified principal office can create a cause
of action without any of the acts of alleged infringement having occurred in Signature Not Verified
Digitally Signed By:ANIL Signing Date:31.05.2023 16:38:50 Delhi. It was for the plaintiff to show
what was the special happening in Delhi which has not happened in Bombay. Further, there is
nothing on record to show that the defendant was targeting the customers in Delhi or that there is
commercial transaction which took place in Delhi. Defendant does not run any TV Channel in Delhi
or in India, and mere accessibility of a website in a geographical area does not constitute a cause of
action when the defendant has not targeted Indian customers as a whole or in Delhi in particular
and for this, reliance for was placed on 2010 (42) PTC 361 (Del.) Banyan Tree Holding (P) Ltd. v. A.
Murali Krishna Reddy & Anr. It was contended that in terms of section 134 of the Trademarks Act
and the decisions reported as AIR 2015 SC 3479 Indian Performing Rights Society Ltd. v. Sanjay
Dalia & Ors., 2016 (65) PTC 469 (Del.) Ultra Home Construction Pvt. Ltd. v. Purushottam Kumar
Chaubey & Ors., 2017 SCC OnLine Del 6783 HSIL Ltd. v. Marvel Ceramics & Ors., 2018 SCC OnLine
Del 7545 Huntsman International (India) Pvt. Ltd. v. Abiss Textile Solutions Pvt. Ltd. & Ors. and
2017 (71) PTC 155 (Del.) Federal Express Corporation v. Fedex Securities Limited & Ors. that
misstatement of the plaintiff is fatal to its claim, and hence, liable to be returned. It was contended
that the use of Delhi address in a trademark application cannot confer jurisdiction on this court and
reliance was placed on (2006) 9 SCC 41 Dhodha House v. SK Maingi.
16. It was contended on behalf of the defendant that no cause of action whatsoever has arisen in
Delhi. E! News Now and E! Now has not been used in India for any channel/ programme or offering
any services to internet user in India and the defendant€s E! family of trademarks enjoys Signature
Not Verified Digitally Signed By:ANIL Signing Date:31.05.2023 16:38:50 transborder reputation in
India. The test of jurisdiction lies in purposefully availing it by targeting the consumers in that
jurisdiction and mere accessibility of the website. While, defendant€s marks have been exposed to
Indian public and acquired fame and reputation in India, defendant has never specifically targeted
Indian customers under these marks, and hence, this court has no jurisdiction. It was also
contended that no cause of action can arise from the cease and desist letter and that the said letters
were sent to the Delhi office only because the relevant trademark applications were filed using the
Delhi address. Reliance was placed on ILR (2005) 2 Del. 751 Golden Peacock Overseas v. Ranjit
Industries and (2011) 177 DLT 789 M/s. Carmel Overseas Ltd. v. Sturdy Industries Ltd.
17. In its rejoinder arguments, it was contended on behalf of the plaintiff that the cease and desist
notice has been given a statutory sanction for giving rise to a cause of action as Section 142 of the
Trademarks Act provides that a groundless threat of legal proceedings gives rise to a cause of action
and if the plaintiff is threatened by the said cease and desist notice, plaintiff can seek a declaration.
In this case, there is not only a challenge to a plaintiff€s right, but his proposed action also, and
hence, the plaintiff can seek injunction. It was further submitted that the broadcasting business is
conducted from the Delhi€s office of the plaintiff, and in terms of Section 60 of the Copyright Act

which is equivalent to the Section 142 of the Trademarks Act, the cease and desist notice would give
rise to a cause of action. Furthermore, to counter the argument that the plaintiff misled the
Registrar, reliance was placed on Section 18 of the Act and Rule 3 of the Trademark Rules.
Signature Not Verified Digitally Signed By:ANIL Signing Date:31.05.2023 16:38:50
18. It is stated that it was the defendant who chose to serve the notice upon the plaintiff at Delhi
office and as the substantial part of the cause of action arose in Delhi, cease and desist notice was
received by plaintiff at Delhi and the corporate office of the plaintiff is at Delhi, the court at Delhi
would have the jurisdiction and the plaint would be maintainable before this Hon€ble Court and the
application under Order VII Rule 10 and 11 of the Code of Civil Procedure would not be
maintainable. Reliance was also placed on the decisions cited as (2006) 6 SCC 207 Om Prakash
Srivastava v. Union of India & Anr., 2004 (28) PTC 251 SC Exphar SA & Anr. v. Eupharma
Laboratories & Anr., 2011 (48) PTC 380 (Del) South African Breweries International (finance), B.V.

Mukesh Sharma & Anr., and 2018 (76) PTC 90 (Del) Burger King Corporation vs. Techchand
Shewakrami & Ors.
19. It was further submitted that the assertion by the defendant that it neither has any TV or
broadcasting business in India nor has any application services in India, but its website targets the
customers in US, Latin America, Italy and some other European nations and not in India, is
incorrect as the defendant has asserted its rights in India in its written statement, legal notice and
pleadings before the Registrar. If the said assertion is to be believed then in absence of a mark in
India, the defendant cannot claim that it has a trans-border reputation. Further, in the absence of
any use of trademark E! Now and E! News Now in India, no proprietary right can be claimed by
Defendant in India. Reliance was placed on (2018) 73 PTC 1 (SC) Toyota Jidosha Kabushiki Kaisha
v. Prius Auto Inds. Ltd. & Signature Not Verified Digitally Signed By:ANIL Signing Date:31.05.2023
16:38:50 Ors. and (2012) 49 PTC (Del.) Trans Tyres India Pvt. Ltd.v. Double Coin Holdings Ltd. &
Anr.
20. It was further countered on behalf of the plaintiff that the defence of "common to trade" cannot
be based on mere presence of marks on the trademark register, rather any plea of "common to
trade" has to be established by evidence of substantial usage, which has not been shown by the
defendant in the present case. Further, the issue in the present suit is inter se the parties and
therefore, the third party usages as cited as a defence to the acts of infringement and passing off
cannot be given any weightage as has been held by the court in various decisions cited as 2008 (38)
PTC 49 (Del.) (DB) Pankaj Goel v. Dabur India Ltd., AIR 1971 SC 898 National Bell v. Metal Goods,
AIR 1960 SC 142 Corn Products Refining Co. v. Shangrila Food Products Ltd., and 2009 (41) PTC 57
(Del.) Novartis AG v. Crest Pharma Pvt. Ltd. & Anr. It was further submitted that the plaintiff was
unaware about the said "common to trade" remark and learnt about the same when pointed out by
the defendant in its application under Order XXXIX Rule 4. The letter mentioning the remarks
"common to trade" was sent by the erstwhile attorney without the plaintiffs€ consent and a remedial
action against the same was taken by the plaintiff and in any event, the exclusivity, goodwill and
distinctiveness of the word "NOW" has to be tested independently. It was further submitted that

merely because plaintiff took a stand while seeking registration cannot operate as estoppel in law
against the plaintiff from exercising its statutory rights and reliance was placed on 2019 (79) PTC 99
(Del.) Telecare Network India Pvt. Ltd. v. Asus Signature Not Verified Digitally Signed By:ANIL

& Mauritz AB & Anr. v. HM Megabrands Pvt. Ltd.
21. It was also submitted by the plaintiff that the defendant pleaded concealment and
misrepresentation by the plaintiff in respect of the three trademark registration namely LOVCOM in
class 9, LOVCOM NOW in class 16 and Romedy Now in Class 38. It was countered by the plaintiff
that there are 77 registrations in class 38 and 73 registration in class 41 without any disclaimer, and
just one declaimer in class 38 does not affect the proprietary right conferred in the Plaintiff in
respect of "NOW" family of marks. Reliance was placed on 2007 (35) PTC 95 (Del.) Cadbury India v.
Neeraj Food Products and 2012 (50) PTC 60 (Del.) Research in Motion v. Data Infosys. It was
submitted that even otherwise, disclaimers do not affect the passing off action and reliance was
placed on the decision in (1955) 2 SCR 252 Registrar of Trademarks v. Ashok Chandra. It was
further submitted that the plaintiff was unaware about the disclaimer issued to the registration
under class 38 and that the said disclaimer was incorrectly incorporated by the Registrar as no
objection was raised to registration of "NOW" as a part of trademark application for LOVCOM NOW
in class 9 and 16 and Romedy Now in class 38. Romedy NOW is already registered in class 38 and 41
without any disclaimer as a word mark vide registration no. 2500343 and as trademark vide
registration no. 2500344 respectively.
22. It was further countered that in terms of Section 31 of the Trademark Act, there is a prima facie
presumption of the validity of the Trademark, and that this court cannot go into the validity of the
registration, as held in Signature Not Verified Digitally Signed By:ANIL Signing Date:31.05.2023
16:38:50 (2018) 2 SCC 112 Patel Field Marshal Agencies & Anr. v. P.M. Diesels Ltd. & Ors.
23. Heard counsel for both the parties and perused the record.
I.A. 8832/2019 (under Order VII Rule 10 & 11 CPC - by defendant)
24. The grounds urged by the defendant seeking return of the plaint, inter alia, are that neither the
plaintiff nor the defendant work for gain in Delhi and also no cause of action has arisen in Delhi in
terms of the test laid down by this Court in the decision reported as 2010 (42) PTC 361 (Del.)
Banyan Tree Holding (P) Ltd. v. A. Murali Krishna Reddy & Anr. Mere sending of the legal notice by
lawyers of defendant addressed to the authorized officers of plaintiff at Delhi will not create a cause
of action, particularly when there was no threatened action contemplated in the said notice. Further,
the rejoinder which according to the plaintiff was the cease and desist notice was not addressed to
the plaintiff€s corporate office at New Delhi but to the counsel.
25. Section 134 of the Trade Marks Act (in short the TM Act) reads as under:
"134. Suit for infringement, etc., to be instituted before District Court.--

institution of the suit or other proceeding, the person instituting the suit or
proceeding, or, where there are more than one such persons any of them, actually

proprietor and the registered user."
26. In the decision reported as AIR 2015 SC 3479 Indian Performing Rights Society Ltd. v. Sanjay
Dalia & Ors., Hon€ble Supreme Court held:
16. "Corporation" in the Explanation to Section 20 CPC would mean not only the
statutory corporation but companies registered under the Companies Act, as held by
this Court in Patel Roadways Ltd. v. Prasad Trading Co. [(1991) 4 SCC 270] and New
Moga Transport Co. v. United India Insurance Co. Ltd. [New Moga Transport Co. v.
United India Insurance Co. Ltd., (2004) 4 SCC 677] The domicile of the company is
fixed by the situation of its principal place of business as held in Jones v. Scottish
Accident Insurance Co. Ltd. [(1886) LR 17 QBD 421 (DC)] In the case of companies
registered under the Companies Act, the controlling power is, as a fact, generally
exercised at the registered office, and that office is therefore not only for the purposes
of the Act, but for other purposes, the principal place of business, as held in Watkins
v. Scottish Imperial Insurance Co. [(1889) LR 23 QBD 285 (DC)] A company may
have subordinate or branch offices in fifty different jurisdictions and it may be sued
in any one of such jurisdictions in respect of a cause of action arising there, has been
held in Peoples' Insurance Co. Ltd. v. Benoy Bhusan Bhowmik [1943 SCC OnLine Cal

17. Accrual of cause of action is a sine qua non for a suit to be filed. Cause of action is a bundle of
facts which is required to be proved to grant relief to the plaintiff. Cause of action not only refers to
the infringement but also the material facts on which right is founded. Section 20 CPC recognises
the territorial jurisdiction of the courts inter alia where the cause of action wholly or in part arises. It
has to be decided in each case whether cause of action wholly or in part arises at a particular place,
as held by this Court in Rajasthan High Court Advocates' Assn. v. Union of India [(2001) 2 SCC 294
: AIR 2001 SC 416] . Thus, a plaintiff can also file a suit where the cause of action wholly or in part
arises.
18. On a due and anxious consideration of the provisions contained in Section 20 CPC, Section 62 of
the Copyright Act and Section 134 of the Trade Marks Act, and the object with which the latter
provisions have been enacted, it is clear that if a cause of action has arisen wholly or in part, where
the plaintiff is residing or having its principal office/carries on business or personally works for
gain, the suit can be filed at such place(s). The plaintiff(s) can also institute a suit at a place where he
is residing, carrying on business or personally works for gain dehors the fact that the cause of action
has not arisen at a place where he/they are residing or any one of them is residing, carries on
business or personally works for gain. However, this right to institute suit at such a place has to be
read subject to certain restrictions, such as in case the plaintiff is residing or carrying on business at
a particular place/having its head office and at such place cause of action has also arisen wholly or in
part, the plaintiff cannot ignore such a place under the guise that he is carrying on business at other
far-flung places also. The very intendment of the insertion of provision in the Copyright Act and the
Trade Marks Act is the convenience of the plaintiff. The rule of convenience of the parties has been
given a statutory expression in Section 20 CPC as well. The interpretation of provisions has to be
such which prevents the mischief of causing inconvenience to the parties.

27. Following the law laid down by the Hon€ble Supreme Court in Sanjay Dalia (supra) this court in
the decision reported as 2016 (65) PTC 469 (Del.) (DB) Ultra Home Construction Pvt. Ltd. v.
Purushottam Kumar Chaubey & Ors., observed:
13. By virtue of the Supreme Court decision in Sanjay Dalia (supra) this deeming
provision contained in the explanation in section 20 of the Code has been read into
section 134(2) of the Trade Marks Act, 1999 and section 62(2) of the Copyright Act,
1957 for the purposes of isolating the place where the plaintiff can be said to carry on
business. It will be noted that though the expression "carries on business" is used in
all the three provisions (i.e., section 20 of the Code, section 134(2) of the Trade marks
Act, 1999 and section 62(2) of the Copyright Act, 1957), the deeming provision
contained in the Explanation in section 20 of the Code has not been expressly
Bennett, Coleman & Company ... vs E! Entertainment Television Llc on 31 May, 2023
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/119534644/
11
incorporated in the other two provisions. But, the Supreme Court has, in the said
decision, given the expression "carries on business" used in relation to a corporation
in the context of a defendant in section 20 of the Code the same meaning when it is
used in relation to a plaintiff under the said sections 134(2) and 62(2). It would be
instructive to note the following observations of the Supreme Court in the said
decision:
"14. Considering the very language of Section 62 of the Copyright Act and Section 134
of the Trade Marks Act, an additional forum has been provided by including a
District Court within whose limits the plaintiff actually and voluntarily resides or
carries on business or personally works for gain.
The object of the provisions was to enable the plaintiff to institute a suit at a place
where he or they resided or carried on business, not to enable them to drag the
defendant further away from such a place also as is being done in the instant cases. In
our opinion, the expression "notwithstanding anything contained in the Code of Civil
Procedure" does not oust the applicability of the provisions of Section 20 of the Code
of Civil Procedure and it is clear that additional remedy has been provided to the
plaintiff so as to file a suit where he is Signature Not Verified Digitally Signed
By:ANIL Signing Date:31.05.2023 16:38:50 residing or carrying on business, etc. as
the case may be. Section 20 of the Code of Civil Procedure enables a plaintiff to file a
suit where the defendant resides or where cause of action arose. Section 20(a) and
Section 20(b) usually provides the venue where the defendant or any of them resides,
carries on business or personally works for gain. Section 20(c) of the Code of Civil
Procedure enables a plaintiff to institute a suit where the cause of action wholly or in
part, arises. The Explanation to Section 20 CPC has been added to the effect that
corporation shall be deemed to carry on business at its sole or principal office in
India or in respect of any cause of action arising at any place where it has subordinate
office at such place. Thus, "corporation" can be sued at a place having its sole or
principal office and where cause of action wholly or in part, arises at a place where it
has also a subordinate office at such place.
15. The learned author Mulla in Code of Civil Procedure, 18th Edn., has observed that
under clauses (a) to (c) of Section 20, the plaintiff has a choice of forum to institute a
suit. The intendment of the Explanation to Section 20 of the Code of Civil Procedure
is that once the corporation has a subordinate office in the place where the cause of
action arises wholly or in part, it cannot be heard to say that it cannot be sued there
because it did not carry on business at that place. The linking of the place with the
cause of action in the Explanation where subordinate office of the corporation is
situated is reflective of the intention of the legislature and such a place has to be the
place of the filing of the suit and not the principal place of business. Ordinarily the
suit has to be filed at the place where there is principal place of business of the
corporation."

xxxx xxxx xxxx xxxx xxxx "18. On a due and anxious consideration of the provisions
contained in Section 20 CPC, Section 62 of the Copyright Act and Section 134 of the
Trade Marks Act, and the object with which the latter provisions have been enacted,
it is clear that if a cause of action has arisen wholly or in part, where the Signature
Not Verified Digitally Signed By:ANIL Signing Date:31.05.2023 16:38:50 plaintiff is
residing or having its principal office/carries on business or personally works for
gain, the suit can be filed at such place(s). The plaintiff(s) can also institute a suit at a
place where he is residing, carrying on business or personally works for gain dehors
the fact that the cause of action has not arisen at a place where he/they are residing
or any one of them is residing, carries on business or personally works for gain.
However, this right to institute suit at such a place has to be read subject to certain
restrictions, such as in case the plaintiff is residing or carrying on business at a
particular place/having its head office and at such place cause of action has also
arisen wholly or in part, the plaintiff cannot ignore such a place under the guise that
he is carrying on business at other far-flung places also. The very intendment of the
insertion of provision in the Copyright Act and the Trade Marks Act is the
convenience of the plaintiff. The rule of convenience of the parties has been given a
statutory expression in Section 20 CPC as well. The interpretation of provisions has
to be such which prevents the mischief of causing inconvenience to the parties.
19. The intendment of the aforesaid provisions inserted in the Copyright Act and the
Trade Marks Act is to provide a forum to the plaintiff where he is residing, carrying
on business or personally works for gain. The object is to ensure that the plaintiff is
not deterred from instituting infringement proceedings "because the court in which
proceedings are to be instituted is at a considerable distance from the place of their
ordinary residence". The impediment created to the plaintiff by Section 20 CPC of
going to a place where it was not having ordinary residence or principal place of
business was sought to be removed by virtue of the aforesaid provisions of the
Copyright Act and the Trade Marks Act. Where the corporation is having ordinary
residence/principal place of business and cause of action has also arisen at that place,
it has to institute a suit at the said place and not at other places.
The provisions of Section 62 of the Copyright Act and Section 134 of the Trade Marks Act never
intended to operate in the Signature Not Verified Digitally Signed By:ANIL Signing Date:31.05.2023
16:38:50 field where the plaintiff is having its principal place of business at a particular place and
the cause of action has also arisen at that place so as to enable it to file a suit at a distant place where
its subordinate office is situated though at such place no cause of action has arisen. Such
interpretation would cause great harm and would be juxtaposed to the very legislative intendment of
the provisions so enacted.
20. In our opinion, in a case where the cause of action has arisen at a place where the plaintiff is
residing or where there are more than one such persons, any of them actually or voluntarily resides
or carries on business or personally works for gain would oust the jurisdiction of other place where
the cause of action has not arisen though at such a place, by virtue of having subordinate office, the

plaintiff instituting a suit or other proceedings might be carrying on business or personally works for
gain.
21. At the same time, the provisions of Section 62 of the Copyright Act and Section 134 of the Trade
Marks Act have removed the embargo of suing at place of accrual of cause of action wholly or in
part, with regard to a place where the plaintiff or any of them ordinarily resides, carries on business
or personally works for gain. We agree to the aforesaid extent that the impediment imposed under
Section 20 CPC to a plaintiff to institute a suit in a court where the defendant resides or carries on
business or where the cause of action wholly or in part arises, has been removed. But the right is
subject to the rider in case the plaintiff resides or has its principal place of business/carries on
business or personally works for gain at a place where cause of action has also arisen, suit should be
filed at that place not at other places where the plaintiff is having branch offices, etc.
22. There is no doubt about it that the words used in Section 62 of the Copyright Act and Section 134
of the Trade Marks Act, "notwithstanding anything contained in CPC or any other law for the time
being in force", emphasise that the requirement of Section 20 CPC would not have to be complied
with by the Signature Not Verified Digitally Signed By:ANIL Signing Date:31.05.2023 16:38:50
plaintiff if he resides or carries on business in the local limits of the court where he has filed the suit
but, in our view, at the same time, as the provision providing for an additional forum, cannot be
interpreted in the manner that it has authorised the plaintiff to institute a suit at a different place
other than the place where he is ordinarily residing or having principal office and incidentally where
the cause of action wholly or in part has also arisen. The impugned judgments, in our considered
view, do not take away the additional forum and fundamental basis of conferring the right and
advantage to the authors of the Copyright Act and the Trade Marks Act provided under the aforesaid
provisions."
28. Thus, in view of the law laid down by the Hon€ble Supreme Court in Sanjay Dalia followed by
this Court in Ultra Home (supra) Section 134 of the Trade Marks Act provides an additional forum
for filing the suit where the plaintiff resides or carries out works for gain and in the case of a
corporation it is the principal office of the corporation or its registered office which can be held to be
the place where the corporation works. In case the plaintiff chooses to institute the suit at a place
where it does not have the principal office but subsidiary office, then as held in illustration (c) in
Ultra Home, cause of action or part of cause of action should arise at the said place. Undoubtedly,
the plaintiff, which is a company incorporated under the Company€s Act, has its principal place of
office i.e. the registered office at Mumbai and not at Delhi though stated in the plaint but sought to
be amended and clarified by IA No. 8834/2019. Conscious of the fact that the plaintiff€s principal
place of office/ work is not at Delhi but at Mumbai, the claim of the plaintiff is that in view of
Section 134 of the TM Act and the law laid down in Sanjay Dalia and Ultra Home, because cause of
action Signature Not Verified Digitally Signed By:ANIL Signing Date:31.05.2023 16:38:50 arises in
Delhi and the plaintiff has its subsidiary offices in Delhi, this Court has jurisdiction to entertain the
suit. At this stage it will be relevant to note the paragraph dealing with the cause of action in the
plaint for the reason in an application under Order VII Rule 10/11 CPC averments in the plaint have
to be seen by way of a demurer. Para 64 to 67 of the plaint read as under:
Bennett, Coleman & Company ... vs E! Entertainment Television Llc on 31 May, 2023
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/119534644/
14
"64. That the cause of action first arose on 10.10.2018, when the Defendant Company
filed the evidence in support of opposition under Rule 45 and for the first time
claimed its right over the. mark E!NEWS NOW. The cause of action further arose
when Cease and Desist notice dated 30.05.2018; was sent by the Defendant, wherein
the Plaintiff Company learnt that it's marks E NOW are being opposed by the
Defendant on the pretext of its mark E!.
65. That the cause of action further arose on 12.07.2018, when the Reply was sent by
the Plaintiff Company denying its deceptive similarity between the two marks and
asserting that the mark of the Plaintiff is dissimilar as it has suffix NOW attached to it
which is a series mark related to the Times Network.
66. That the cause of action again arose on 10.01.2019, when the Defendant Company filed the
evidence in reply under Rule 47 of the Trademarks Rules, 2017 and for the first time claimed its
right over the mark E! NOW and E! NEWS NOW respectively. The cause of action again arose on
04.02.2019 when the Defendant Company filed the evidence in support of opposition under Rule 45
in Trade mark Application No. 3749183 and for the first time claimed its right over the mark E!
NOW and E! NEWS NOW. The cause of action again arose on 24.04.2019 when the Defendant
Company for the first time asserted its right and stated that it is using the marks and logos Signature
Not Verified Digitally Signed By:ANIL Signing Date:31.05.2023 16:38:50 "E! NOW" and "E! NEWS
NOW", which is deceptively similar to the marks "E NOW" and "NOW" owned by the Plaintiffs
67. That the cause of action further arose when Plaintiff, thereafter issued a Rejoinder to the Notice
dated 24.04.2019 calling upon the Defendant Company to refrain from using our client's word/
mark 'NOW' as a prefix or a suffix to any word, alphabet, symbol or in any Other manner and
further, refrain from using our client's mark 'NOW as part of any logo including the word/logo
'E-NEWS NOW or 'ENOW alleged in your notice under response as your client's word/logo."
29. On the issue whether the place of service of a cease and desist letter can confer jurisdiction on
the court, in the decision reported as 2004 (28) PTC 251 (SC) Exphar SA & Anr. v. Eupharma
Laboratories & Anr., it was held by Hon€ble Supreme Court that:
"8. Besides when an objection to jurisdiction is raised by way of demurrer and not at
the trial, the objection must proceed on the basis that the facts as pleaded by the
initiator of the impugned proceedings are true. The submission in order to succeed
must show that granted those facts the Court does not have jurisdiction as a matter of
law. In rejecting a plaint on the ground of jurisdiction, the Division Bench should
have taken the allegations contained in the plaint to be correct. However, the Division
Bench examined the written statement filed by the respondents in which it was
claimed that the goods were not at all sold within the territorial jurisdiction of the
Delhi High Court and also that the respondent No. 2 did not carry on business within
the jurisdiction of the Delhi High Court. Having recorded the appellants' objections
to these factual statements by the respondents, surprisingly the Division Bench said:

limits of any Court in India what to of Delhi".

14. Furthermore, the appellants' plaint said that the `cease and desist' notice was sent
to the appellant No. 2 at its office in New Delhi and in that notice it was alleged that
the appellant No. 2 had infringed the copyright of the respondent No. 2 to the
trademark `Maloxine'. Now a cease and desist notice means that the recipient is
alleged to have infringed the rights of the sender of the notice to the copyright and as
a result of such alleged infringement the recipient is liable to institution of civil
and/or criminal proceedings. It is a threat.
The plaint says that this threat was received within the jurisdiction of the High Court
a fact which was sufficient to invoke the jurisdiction of that Court.
15. The respondents' reliance on the decision of this Court in Oil and Natural Gas
Commission v. Utpal Kumar Basu and Ors., 1994 (1) Supp SCR 252 and Union of
India and Others v. Advani Exports Ltd. and Another, 2002 (1) SCC 567 is inapposite.
Those decisions held that the service of a mere notice may not be sufficient to found
jurisdiction unless such notice formed an integral part of the cause of action. But a
`cease and desist' notice in a copyright action cannot, particularly in view of Section
60 of the Act, be termed to be a `mere' notice. Such a threat may give rise to the right
to institute a suit to counter such threat and to ask for relief on the ground that the
alleged infringement to which the threat related was not in fact an infringement of
any legal right of the person making such threat."
30. For a cease and desist notice there should be a threat of an action which gives rise to the cause of
action. In the present case, the cease and desist notice dated 30th May, 2018 has been issued by the
defendant€s counsel to the plaintiff at the plaintiff€s office at 7, Bahadur Shah Zafar Marg, New
Delhi with regard to its „E€ family of mark. The defendant in its cease and desist notice dated 30th
May, 2018 though did not raise any claim whatsoever in respect of „NOW€ mark, it stated that the
defendant adopted the mark „E!€ and other „E!€ formative marks several years ago and is a 24
hours network, its programming dedicated to the world of entertainment.
Signature Not Verified Digitally Signed By:ANIL Signing Date:31.05.2023 16:38:50 The defendant
also stated that it is the registered proprietor of „E€ and „E€ formative marks in Classes 9, 38 and 41

since 30 th December, 1993, 2nd December, 2003, 25th March, 2010 and 31st May, 2012. The
defendant specifically required the plaintiff in the notice dated 30th May, 2018 to cease and desist
from using the mark . The defendant claimed that since it is proprietor of „E!€ and its formative
mark, it asked the plaintiff to withdraw application No. 3679903 and 3679905 and cease and desist
from using the mark, being a derivative of „E€ family of mark. In response to the cease and desist
notice dated 30th May, 2018 the plaintiff replied vide its letter dated 12th July, 2018 where the
plaintiff claimed that it was the proprietor of the well-known trade mark „NOW€ and was using the
same as a prominent part of its various renowned and reputed News Entertainment channels,
namely, „TIMES NOW€, „ET NOW€, „MOVIES NOW€, „MIRROR NOW€ and „ROMEDY NOW€.
The plaintiff further claims cause of action based on the rejoinder-cum-notice dated 24th April,
2019 to the plaintiff€s reply dated 12th July, 2018 being addressed at Delhi wherein for the first
time the defendant asked the plaintiff company to refrain from using the mark „NOW€ as a prefix or
a suffix, or as part of any logo including the word/logo „E NEWS NOW€ or „E NOW€.
31. Claim of the defendant is that the cause of action is based on the rejoinder which cannot give rise
to the jurisdiction of the Court for the reason the rejoinder of the defendant was addressed to the
counsel for the plaintiff and not to the plaintiff at its Delhi office. A rejoinder to the counsel at the
address of the counsel€s cannot vest territorial jurisdiction in Signature Not Verified Digitally
Signed By:ANIL Signing Date:31.05.2023 16:38:50 the Court. According to the defendant merely
because the cease and desist notice was received by the plaintiff at its Delhi office, will not give rise
to cause of action for the reason in the said cease and desist notice the defendant nowhere asked the
plaintiff to desist from using the mark/ logo „NOW€ and only asked the plaintiff to refrain from
using „E€ or „E!€ and its formative marks.
32. The claim of the defendant is that in the notice dated 30 th May, 2018 no notice of cease and
desist was given qua mark „NOW€ and it was only in the rejoinder that a cease and desist notice qua
the mark „NOW€ was given which was between the counsel to a counsel and hence no jurisdiction in
the Court at Delhi gets vested. This contention of learned counsel is contrary to Para 64 of the plaint
reproduced herein wherein cause of action is pleaded on the basis of cease and desist notice dated
30th May, 2018 and the relevant paragraph of the said notice where the defendant has asked the
plaintiff to cease and desist from using the mark E NOW is reproduced hereinafter.
"In the above circumstances, our client has now also instructed us to write to you,
which we hereby do and put you on notice of their rights, to call upon you and to
prevail upon you to forthwith;
i. Disclose the nature and extent of use, if any of the marks or any other mark
confusingly and/or deceptively similar to our client's E! Family of Marks in respect of
goods and/or services of any nature whatsoever and to immediately cease and desist
from using the said mark(s) either as a trade mark or in any other manner

iii. Immediately withdraw your application nos. 3679903 and 3679905 under intimation to us;

client; and v. Give an undertaking in a form to be approved by us that you shall not in the future, use

our client's E! Family of Marks.
We will look forward to hearing from you within two weeks of receipt of this letter by you that you
are complying with the requisitions aforementioned. If you fail to respond, our client will be
perfectly justified in presuming that despite the fact that you do not dispute our claim in and to our
client's E! Family of Marks; you do not intend to give up your wrongful claim to proprietorship of
the impugned marks .
Under such circumstances our client shall be free to initiate appropriate legal proceedings against
you for the protection of their rights, including but not limited to taking the oppositions Signature

no. 3679903 and 3679905 to their logical conclusion.
We look forward to your response. In the meanwhile, our client reserves all rights."
33. As noted from the averments in the cease and desist notice dated 30 th May, 2018 the defendant
besides seeking disclosure from the plaintiff about the nature and extent of the use of E NOW marks
or any other mark confusingly or deceptively similar to the defendant€s and E! family of marks in
respect of the goods and services, has also sought immediate cease and desist from using the said
mark/ marks either as a trade mark or in any other manner with the notice served to the plaintiff at
its subsidiary office at Delhi. Thus in terms of the decision of the Hon€ble Supreme Court in Exphar
SA & Anr. (supra) and of this Court in Ultra Home (supra) this Court will have jurisdiction to try the
offence based on the averments in the plaint. Claim of the defendant that in the notice dated 30th
May, 2018 it did not preclude the plaintiff from using „NOW€ mark deserves to be rejected in view
of the defendant asking the plaintiff from desisting to use „E NOW€ and the threat of action evident
from the words that the defendant was free to initiate the proceedings.
34. The defendant also pleads that there was no cause of action on the basis of quia timet as the
threat has to be genuine, reasonable and valid and should pose an imminent danger. It was stated
t h a t  t h e  t w o  d o c u m e n t s  f i l e d  b y  t h e  p l a i n t i f f  w e r e  t h e  e x t r a c t s  o f  w e b s i t e s

April, 2019 and the link was travelling to E-online. The two websites being in Spanish and Latin and
not even in English, there was no threatened action.
35. Plaintiff also claims cause of action on the basis of proposed user of the mark „NOW€ by the
defendant as is also evident from ex-parte interim order of this Court dated 14th May, 2019. The
concept of quia timet action was elaborated by the Hon€ble Supreme Court in its decision reported
as AIR 2000 SC 1410 Kuldip Singh v. Subhash Chander Jain & Ors. wherein it was held:
6. A quia timet action is a bill in equity. It is an action preventive in nature and a
specie of precautionary justice intended to prevent apprehended wrong or
anticipated mischief and not to undo a wrong or mischief when it has already been
done. In such an action the court, if convinced, may interfere by appointment of
receiver or by directing security to be furnished or by issuing an injunction or any
other remedial process. In Fletcher v. Bealey [(1885) 28 Ch D 688 : 54 LJ Ch 424 : 52
LT 541] , Mr Justice Pearson explained the law as to actions quia timet as follows:
"There are at least two necessary ingredients for a quia timet action. There must, if no
actual damage is proved, be proof of imminent danger, and there must also be proof
that the apprehended damage will, if it comes, be very substantial. I should almost
say it must be proved that it will be irreparable, because, if the danger is not proved
to be so imminent that no one can doubt that, if the remedy is delayed the damage
will be suffered, I think it must be shown that, if the damage does occur at any time, it
will come in such a way and under such circumstances that it will be impossible for
the plaintiff to protect himself against it if relief is denied to him in a quia timet
action".
9. The nuisance complained of by the plaintiffs and which was yet to accrue was to
fall in the category of private nuisance. The remedies for private nuisance are (1)
abatement, (2) damages, and Signature Not Verified Digitally Signed By:ANIL
Signing Date:31.05.2023 16:38:50 (3) injunction. In order to obtain an injunction it
must be shown that the injury complained of as present or impending is such as by
reason of its gravity, or its permanent character, or both, cannot be adequately
compensated in damages. If the injury is continuous the court will not refuse an
injunction because the actual damage arising from it is slight (Ratanlal & Dhirajlal's
Law of Torts, edited by Justice G.P. Singh, 22nd Edn., pp. 522-24).
36. Further, this Court in the decision cited as 2017 (70) PTC 316 (Del.) Radico Khaitan Ltd. v.
Nakshatra Distilleries & Breweries Ltd & Ors. elaborated on the maintainability of a quia timet
action and observed:
22. ... It is also the settled principle in law that the Court even while considering the
application under Order VII Rule11 of the CPC is to scrutinise the plaint and the
documents filed therewith to see whether the pleas are substantial and material or

not or merely a play of words so as to initiate the legal process. The words "dynamic
effect" and credible and imminent threat" sound impressive but are without any
particulars and hollow. Such words cannot be permitted to create territorial
jurisdiction of the Court. If such words were to be permitted to create territorial
jurisdiction, the same would result in the Courts allowing their process to be used as
a tool of harassment by permitting a plaintiff to drag a defendant to any Court where
the plaintiff may feel that it will have an advantage over the defendant. Moreover,
whether a Court has a territorial jurisdiction or not is a question of law and a party to
the lis cannot be permitted to "create" territorial jurisdiction. When a threatened act
cannot be done without following a procedure and that procedure has not even been
initiated, the threat cannot be said to be real and imminent so as to vest the Court
with the jurisdiction even in a quia timet action.
37. As noted above, from the notice dated 30th May, 2018 the defendant filing evidence in support
of opposition under Rule 45 and the rejoinder filed it is evident that there was an imminent threat of
action and hence a Signature Not Verified Digitally Signed By:ANIL Signing Date:31.05.2023
16:38:50 quia timet action which is preventive in nature was maintainable based on the pleadings in
the suit.
38. Consequently, it is held that this Court has the territorial jurisdiction to entertain the suit and
finds no merit in the application under Order VII Rule 10 & 11 and the same is liable to be
dismissed.
I.A. 7077/2019 (under Order XXXIX Rule 1 and 2 CPC - by Plaintiff) I.A. 8833/2019 (under Order
XXXIX Rule 4 CPC - by defendant)
39. As noted above, the claim of the plaintiff is that it is the registered proprietor of the mark
„NOW€ simplicitor and with prefix or suffix and that mark „NOW€ has attained a distinction with
the plaintiff€s product specifically in Class-38 and 41 of the Trademark Registrations which pertain
to television broadcasting services and television based entertainment service respectively, for which
two limited classes, the suit has been filed. It is thus claimed that the defendant€s marks "E!Now"
and "E! News Now" are similar to the plaintiff€s mark „E Now€ which is used in the relation to the
television programs thus, constituting infringement and passing off.
40. It may be noted that the plaintiff is not the proprietor of the stand- alone trademark "NOW" nor
prior user of the said mark in Class-38. Further the stand-alone registration of the plaintiff in
Class-41 is of 18th September, 2014 on the proposed to be used basis and has not been used till date.
Thus, the registration of "NOW" simplicitor in Class-41 cannot be used to seek an injunction against
the defendant€s mark "E! Now" and "E! Signature Not Verified Digitally Signed By:ANIL Signing
Date:31.05.2023 16:38:50 New Now" and the defendant€s first use of "E News Now" is since 30th
September, 2007.
41. The test of infringement of a trademark was laid by the Hon€ble Supreme Court in the case cited
as AIR 1965 SC 980 Kaviraj Pandit Durga Dutt Sharma v. Navaratna Pharmaceutical, wherein it was
Bennett, Coleman & Company ... vs E! Entertainment Television Llc on 31 May, 2023

20
held:
28. The other ground of objection that the findings are inconsistent really proceeds
on an error in appreciating the basic differences between the causes of action and
right to relief in suits for passing off and for infringement of a registered trade mark
and in equating the essentials of a passing off action with those in respect of an action
complaining of an infringement of a registered trade mark. We have already pointed
out that the suit by the respondent complained both of an invasion of a statutory
right under Section 21 in respect of a registered trade mark and also of a passing off
by the use of the same mark. The finding in favour of the appellant to which the
learned counsel drew our attention was based upon dissimilarity of the packing in
which the goods of the two parties were vended, the difference in the physical
appearance of the two packets by reason of the variation in the colour and other
features and their general get-
up together with the circumstance that the name and address of the manufactory of the appellant
was prominently displayed on his packets and these features were all set out for negativing the
respondent's claim that the appellant had passed off his goods as those of the respondent. These
matters which are of the essence of the cause of action for relief on the ground of passing off play but
a limited role in an action for infringement of a registered trade mark by the registered proprietor
who has a statutory right to that mark and who has a statutory remedy for the event of the use by
another of that mark or a colourable imitation thereof. While an action for passing off is a Common
Law remedy being in substance an action for deceit, that is, a passing off by a person of his own
goods as those of another, that is not the gist of an action for infringement. The action for
infringement is a statutory remedy conferred on the registered proprietor of a registered trade mark
for the vindication of the exclusive right to the use of the trade mark in relation to those Signature
Not Verified Digitally Signed By:ANIL Signing Date:31.05.2023 16:38:50 goods" (Vide Section 21 of
the Act). The use by the defendant of the trade mark of the plaintiff is not essential in an action for
passing off, but is the sine qua non in the case of an action for infringement. No doubt, where the
evidence in respect of passing off consists merely of the colourable use of a registered trade mark,
the essential features of both the actions might coincide in the sense that what would be a colourable
imitation of a trade mark in a passing off action would also be such in an action for infringement of
the same trade mark. But there the correspondence between the two ceases. In an action for
infringement, the plaintiff must, no doubt, make out that the use of the defendant's mark is likely to
deceive, but where the similarity between the plaintiff's and the defendant's mark is so close either
visually, phonetically or otherwise and the court reaches the conclusion that there is an imitation, no
further evidence is required to establish that the plaintiff's rights are violated. Expressed in another
way, if the essential features of the trade mark of the plaintiff have been adopted by the defendant,
the fact that the get-up, packing and other writing or marks on the goods or on the packets in which
he offers his goods for sale show marked differences, or indicate clearly a trade origin different from
that of the registered proprietor of the mark would be immaterial; whereas in the case of passing off,
the defendant may escape liability if he can show that the added matter is sufficient to distinguish
his goods from those of the plaintiff.

30. The mark of the respondent which he claims has been infringed by the appellant is the mark
„Navaratna Pharmaceutical Laboratories€, and the mark of the appellant which the respondent
claimed was a colourable imitation of that mark is „Navaratna Pharmacy€. Mr Agarwala here again
stressed the fact that the „Navaratna€ which constituted an essential part or feature of the
Registered Trade Mark was a descriptive word in common use and that if the use of this word in the
appellant's mark were disregarded there would not be enough material left for holding that the
appellant had used a trade mark which was deceptively similar to that of the respondent. But this
proceeds, in our opinion, on ignoring that the appellant is not, as we have explained earlier, entitled
to insist on a disclaimer in regard to that word by the respondent. In these circumstances, the trade
mark to be compared with that used by the Signature Not Verified Digitally Signed By:ANIL Signing
Date:31.05.2023 16:38:50 appellant is the entire registered mark including the word „Navaratna€.
Even otherwise, as stated in a slightly different context: [Kerly on Trade Marks 8th Edn. 407]
"Where common marks are included in the trade marks to be compared or in one of them, the
proper course is to look at the marks as wholes and not to disregard the parts which are common".
42. In the decision reported as (2010) 2 SCC 142 Skyline Education Institute (Pvt.) Ltd. v. SL
Vaswani & Ors., it was held:
18. In our opinion, the findings recorded by the learned Single Judge and Division
Bench on the crucial factors like prima facie case, balance of convenience and equity
are based on a correct and balanced consideration of various facets of the case and it
is not possible to find any fault with the conclusions recorded by them that it is not a
fit case for restraining the respondents from using the word 'Skyline' in the name of
the institute established by them. It has not been disputed on behalf of the appellant
that the word 'Skyline' is being used as trade name by various companies/
organizations/business concerns and also for describing different types of
institute/institutions. The voluminous record produced by the respondents before
this Court shows that in India as many as 117 companies including computer and
software companies and institutions are operating by using word 'Skyline' as part of
their name/nomenclature. In United States of America, at least 10
educational/training institutions are operating with different names using 'Skyline' as
the first word. In United Kingdom also two such institutions are operating. In view of
this, it is not possible to agree with the learned Counsel for the appellant that the
Skyline is not a generic word but is a specific word and his client has right to use that
word to the exclusion of others.
43. Similarly, in AIR 1963 SC 449 Amritdhara Pharmacy v. Satya Deo Gupta it was held:
8. We agree that the use of the word "dhara" which literally means "current or stream" is not by
itself decisive of the matter.
Signature Not Verified Digitally Signed By:ANIL Signing Date:31.05.2023 16:38:50 What we have to
consider here is the overall similarity of the composite words, having regard to the circumstance
that the goods bearing the two names are medicinal preparations of the same description. We are
Bennett, Coleman & Company ... vs E! Entertainment Television Llc on 31 May, 2023
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/119534644/
22
aware that the admission of a mark is not to be refused, because unusually stupid people, "fools or
idiots", may be deceived. A critical comparison of the two names may disclose some points of
difference, but an unwary purchaser of average intelligence and imperfect recollection would be
deceived by the overall similarity of the two names having regard to the nature of the medicine he is
looking for with a somewhat vague recollection that he had purchased a similar medicine on a
previous occasion with a similar name. The trade mark is the whole thing-the whole word has to be
considered. In the case of the application to register "Erectiks" (opposed by the proprietors of the
trade mark "Erector") Farwell, J., said in William Bailey (Birmingham) Ltd. Application [(1935) 52
RPC 137] :
"I do not think it is right to take a part of the word and compare it with a part of the
other word; one word must be considered as a whole and compared with the other
word as a whole.... I think it is a dangerous method to adopt to divide the word up
and seek to distinguish a portion of it from a portion of the other word."
9. Nor do we think that the High Court was right in thinking that the appellant was claiming a
monopoly in the common Hindi word "dhara". We do not think that that is quite the position here.
What the appellant is claiming is its right under Section 21 of the Act, the exclusive right to the use
of its trade mark, and to oppose the registration of a trade mark which so nearly resembles its trade
mark that it is likely to deceive or cause confusion.
10. A large number of decisions relating to the use of composite words, such as Night Cap and Red
Cap, Limit and Summit, Rito and Lito, Motrate and Filtrate etc. were cited in the High Court. Some
more have been cited before us. Such decisions, examples of deceptive resemblance arising out of
contrasted words, have been summarised at p. 429-34 in Kerly on Trade Marks, 8 No useful purpose
will be served by referring to them all. As we have said earlier, each case must be decided on its own
facts. What degree of Signature Not Verified Digitally Signed By:ANIL Signing Date:31.05.2023
16:38:50 resemblance is necessary to deceive or cause confusion must in the nature of things be
incapable of definition a priori.
44. Further, in the decision reported as AIR 1960 SC 142 Corn Products Refining Co. v. Shangrila
Food Products Ltd., it was observed:
15. Now it is a well recognised principle, that has to be taken into account in
considering the possibility of confusion arising between any two trademarks, that,
whether those two marks contain a common element which is also contained in a
number of other marks in use in the same market such a common occurrence in the
market tends to cause purchasers to pay more attention to the other features of the
respective marks and to distinguish between them by those features. This principle
clearly requires that the marks comprising the common element shall be in fairly
extensive use and, as I have mentioned, in use in the market in which the marks
under consideration are being or will be used.

45. Again, in the decision cited as MANU/DE/0832/2020 Peps Industries Pvt. Ltd. v. Kurlon Ltd., it
was held:
21. From the facts as noted above, it is thus evident that the plaintiff has a registered
trade mark "NO TURN" in its favour, the mark "NO TURN" is being used by the
plaintiff as a trade mark. The plaintiff has been in continuous use of this trade mark
"NO TURN" since 15th January, 2008.Defendant is the prior user of the mark since
the year 2007 however since the use of the mark by the defendant is intermittent and
not voluminous so as to establish the defence under Section 34 of the Trade Marks
Act. However, the plaintiff would still not be entitled to the relief of injunction for the
reason the mark "NO TURN" is a descriptive mark. The plaintiff has placed no
material on record to show that on the date of application or even on the date of
registration plaintiff€s trademark "NO TURN" had acquired the distinctiveness to
achieve the status of a well-known mark. Hence, no interim injunction is granted in
favour of the plaintiff. Consequently, IA 4871/2019 is dismissed and IA 6715/2019 is
disposed of.
Signature Not Verified Digitally Signed By:ANIL Signing Date:31.05.2023 16:38:50
46. Whether a mark is a common to trade or not is a question of fact. Similarly, a mark may be a
trademark in some jurisdiction and publici juris in others, but a mark which may be common to
trade at one time may become distinctive over a period of time, or vice versa. In the decision
reported as MANU/DE/0311/1997 SBL Ltd. v. Himalaya Drug Co. it was held:
21. Whether a matter is or is not common to the trade is a question of fact. A feature
which is common to one trade may not be so to a different trade. Similarly a mark
may continue to be trade mark in some countries and public Jurisdiction in others. A
mark which was common to the trade at one time may in course of time become
distinctive and vice versa. A word or words used by a number of firms as part of their
designation may be considered as words in common use (See : Law of Trade Mark
and Passing Off, P. Narayanan, 4th Edn., para 14.2).
X X X
26. Reverting back to the facts of the case, from the documentary evidence filed we
are satisfied that here are about 100 drugs in the market using the abbreviation 'Liv'
made out of the word Liver-and organ of the human body, as a constituent of names
of medicinal/pharmaceutical preparations with some prefix or suffix- mostly suffixes
meant for treatment of ailments or diseases associated with liver. Liv has thus
become a generic term and public juris. It is descriptive in nature and common in
usage. Nobody can claim' an exclusive right to the use of 'Liv' as a constituent of any
trade mark. The class of customers dealing with medicines would distinguish the
name of the medicines by ignoring 'Liv' and by assigning weight to the prefix or suffix
so as to associate the name with the manufacturer.
Bennett, Coleman & Company ... vs E! Entertainment Television Llc on 31 May, 2023
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/119534644/
24
The possibility of deception or confusion is reduced practically to nil in view of the fact that the
medicine will be sold on medical prescription and by licensed dealers well versed in the field and
having knowledge of medicines. The two rival marks Liv. 52 and L JV-T contain a, common feature
Liv which is not only descriptive but also public juris; a customer will tend to ignore the common
feature Signature Not Verified Digitally Signed By:ANIL Signing Date:31.05.2023 16:38:50 and will
pay more attention to uncommon features i.e., 52 and T. The two do not have such phonetic
similarity as to make it objectionable.
47. Similarly, in the decision reported as (2010) 2 SCC 142 Skyline Education Institute (Pvt.) Ltd. v.
SL Vaswani & Ors. held:
18. In our opinion, the findings recorded by the learned Single Judge and Division
Bench on the crucial factors like prima facie case, balance of convenience and equity
are based on a correct and balanced consideration of various facets of the case and it
is not possible to find any fault with the conclusions recorded by them that it is not a
fit case for restraining the respondents from using the word 'Skyline' in the name of
the institute established by them. It has not been disputed on behalf of the appellant
that the word 'Skyline' is being used as trade name by various companies/
organizations/business concerns and also for describing different types of
institute/institutions. The voluminous record produced by the respondents before
this Court shows that in India as many as 117 companies including computer and
software companies and institutions are operating by using word 'Skyline' as part of
their name/nomenclature. In United States of America, at least 10
educational/training institutions are operating with different names using 'Skyline' as
the first word. In United Kingdom also two such institutions are operating. In view of
this, it is not possible to agree with the learned Counsel for the appellant that the
Skyline is not a generic word but is a specific word and his client has right to use that
word to the exclusion of others.
48. Likewise, in the decision reported as MANU/DE/0869/2007 Astrazenca UK Ltd. v. Orchid
Chemicals and Pharmaceuticals Ltd. this Court observed:
20. We are informed that there are a number of such other similar names with the
prefix 'Mero' which are in the market. They were also taken notice of by the learned
Single Judge while dealing with the injunction application. In the decisions of the
Supreme Court and this Court also, it has been clearly held that nobody can claim

exclusive right to use any word, abbreviation, or acronym which has become publici
juris. In the trade of drugs, it is common practice to name a drug by the name of the
organ or ailment which it treats or the main ingredient of the drug. Such an organ
ailment or ingredient being publici Jurisdiction or generic cannot be owned by
anyone exclusively for use as a trade mark. In the Division Bench decision of this
Court in SBL Limited (supra) it was also held that possibility of deception or
confusion is reduced practically to nil in view of the fact that the medicine will be sold

on medical prescription and by licensed dealers well versed in the field and having
knowledge of medicines. It was further held that the two rival marks, 'Liv.52' and
'LIV-T', contain a common feature, 'Liv' which is not only descriptive, but also publici
Jurisdiction and that a customer will tend to ignore the common feature and will pay
more attention to uncommon features i.e. '52' and 'T' and that the two do not have
such phonetic similarity so as to make it objectionable.
21. In our considered opinion the facts of the said case are almost similar and squarely applicable to
the facts of the present case. 'Meropenem' is the molecule which is used for treatment of bacterial
infections. In that view of the matter, the abbreviation 'Mero' became a generic term, is publici
Jurisdiction and it is distinctive in nature. Consequently, the appellants/plaintiffs cannot claim
exclusive right to the use of 'Mero' as constituent of any trademark. The possibility of deception or
confusion is also reduced practically to nil in view of the fact that the medicine is sold only on
prescription by dealers. The common feature in both the competing marks i.e. 'Mero' is only
descriptive and publici Jurisdiction and, Therefore, the customers would tend to ignore the common
feature and would pay more attention to the uncommon feature. Even if they are expressed as a
whole, the two did not have any phonetic similarity to make it objectionable. There are at least four
other registered users of the prefix 'Mero' in India whereas the names of 35 companies using 'Mero'
trademarks, which have been registered or applied for registration, have been furnished in the
pleadings. The respondent/defendant advertised its trademark 'Meromer' after submitting its
application for registration and at that stage, there was no opposition even from the
appellants/plaintiffs. The trademark of Signature Not Verified Digitally Signed By:ANIL Signing
Date:31.05.2023 16:38:50 the respondent/defendant was registered there being no opposition from
any quarter, including the appellants/plaintiffs.
22. Consequently, the two names, namely, 'Meromer' and 'Meronem' are found to be prima facie
dissimilar to each other. They are Schedule-H drugs available only on doctor's prescription. The
factum that the same are available only on doctor's prescription and not as an over the counter
medicine is also relevant and has been rightly taken note of by the learned Single Judge. In our
considered opinion, where the marks are distinct and the features are found to be dis-similar, they
are not likely to create any confusion. It is also admitted by the parties that there is a difference in
the price of the two products. The very fact that the two pharmaceutical products, one of the
appellants/plaintiffs and the other of the respondent/ defendant, are being sold at different prices
itself ensures that there is no possibility of any deception/confusion, particularly in view of the fact
that customer who comes with the intention of purchasing the product of the appellants/plaintiffs
would never settle for the product of the respondent/defendant which is priced much lower. It is
apparent that the trademarks on the two products, one of the appellants/plaintiffs and the other of
the respondent/defendant, are totally dissimilar and different.
49. From the facts as noted it is evident that though the plaintiff has number of registrations with
suffix and prefix "NOW", it is a common word and is used by number of other entities. Further the
plaintiff€s own stand is that the mark „NOW€ is common to trade as stated by the plaintiff in
response to the examination report for ROMEDY NOW under No.2589055 in Class-9, and the
counter statement in relation to opposition filed against the mark „NOW€ under No.1716885 in
Bennett, Coleman & Company ... vs E! Entertainment Television Llc on 31 May, 2023

Class-9. The plaintiff has also given a disclaimer on „NOW€ in registration for LOVCOM in Class-9,
LOVCOM NOW in Class-16 and ROMEDY NOW in Class-38. Thus, the plaintiff cannot be permitted
to claim that the word „NOW€ used by it as a prefix or Signature Not Verified Digitally Signed
By:ANIL Signing Date:31.05.2023 16:38:50 suffix has acquired a distinction. Therefore the
defendant who is a prior user of mark „E€ or E!€ with „NOW€ and „E NEWS NOW€ cannot be
injuncted.
50. There is yet another ground to deny the equitable relief of injunction to the defendant for
suppression of material facts. Plaintiff in his plaint has claimed that it has principal office in Delhi
which fact to the knowledge of the plaintiff is incorrect and is sought to be amended by way of an
application under Order VI Rule 17 CPC. Further the plaintiff on the one hand claims that the
defendant has no transborder reputation affecting the plaintiff€s reputation, thus, denying the
existence of the defendant as a prior user, however, on the other hand claims defendant€s
transborder reputation to claim injunction from the Court.
51. Further, the order dated 14th May, 2019 granting ad-interim injunction also notes that the same
was granted on the representation that the trademark „NOW€ has been registered in various
categories in favour of the plaintiffs since 2006. As noted above in Class 38 and 41 which are the
relevant classes for the present suit, the plaintiff has registration only in Class 41 which is also on the
proposed to be use basis and till now the plaintiff has not used the trademark „NOW€ simplicitor in
Class 41.
52. Consequently, the ad-interim injunction dated 14th May, 2019 is vacated. I.A. 7077/2019 (under
Order XXXIX Rule 1 & 2 CPC - by Plaintiff) is dismissed. I.A. 8832/2019 (under Order VII Rule 10 &
11 CPC
- by defendant) is dismissed. I.A. 8833/2019 (under Order XXXIX Rule 4 CPC - by defendant) is
disposed of.
